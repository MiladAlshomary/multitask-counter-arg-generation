', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]   \n",
       "3  [i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]   \n",

       "      <td>[one of the historical methods of repressing out of favor religions is to make them pay exorbitant taxes., the blanket religious tax exemption is one of the ways we comply with the first amendment., many atheists seem to forget it guarantees the free exercise of religion in addition to forbidding the establishment of a state religion., taxing them like everyone else doesn't make sense because everyone else pays widely varying tax rates., should they be taxed as a commercial entity or an industrial one?, which subtype?, some religious practices involve wine., does that mean the churches will need permits taxes fees licenses as a resturant?, some christian sects consider the use of wine critical to the ceremony, others consider grape juice to be fine because it is symbolism., the rules and regulations answering those questions will burden some religions sects more than others., this then becomes a ripe area for both intentional and unintentional discrimination against out of favor religious groups., this will be hugely problematic for the free exercise clause., it is just as problematic for the establishment clause., as per the current justification for emminent domain, increased tax revenue is a justifying public good., taxing churches like everyone else would allow a state or locality to use eminent domain foreclosures in order to build a new mega church., the baptists catholics whoever will pay greater taxes than the mosque temple out of favor group currently on that corner., back to the wine example, the sect that doesn't use wine now has a significant financial advantage over the one that does., if the existence of a cross shaped veterans memorial is an establishment of religion, then surely providing tax advantages is.]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]   \n",
       "3  [i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]   \n",

       "      <td>[i'm speaking from the perspective of atheism and moral realism., i am trying to determine what effects religious belief generally has, so that i can determine whether and how to combat it., my current hypothesis is that religion enshrines the values of a specific time period within a society., what this means is that the religion forms at a certain point in time, so it will advocate the values present in the culture at that point in time., adherents of the religion adopt and preserve those values over the subsequent decades, centuries, or millenia because they have faith in the religion., if the values are true, the effects of the religion are good, and if they are false, its effects are bad., two examples: 1., the stoics discovered the idea of justice and natural rights, which was integrated into a faith based christian context during the middle ages., this is an example of a religious belief having positive effects, including arguably a the founding of the united states and b martin luther king's advocacy of civil rights for blacks., 2., the hindu caste system is an example of a religious belief that has harmful effects., the caste system was originally due to historical factors, but because it was integrated into the hindu religion, it took on a faith based dimension which preserved it more or less to the present day., i would argue that this must have caused incalculable injustice and suffering., i don't take myself to know that this hypothesis is correct, it's just what currently strikes me as plausible., if you can make a strong case that religion is more plastic than i have allowed, or that the effects of religious belief are invariably or almost invariably harmful or positive , i'll award a delta.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[pretty sure this post is going to get me put on a list or something, so straight off the bat i want to categorically state that i am not a paedophile., i simply just finished watching the episode from season three of black mirror with all the paedophiles, and it got me thinking., as a society, our view on paedophilia seems to be quite simple., we don t like paedophiles, we think they re disgusting, we think they re evil, and we lock them up as soon as they inevitably act on their urges., while this stance is most definitely understandable, in my opinion it is also one that is extremely dated, and needs to be changed., the main reason why i hold this stance can be summed up quite simply: nobody wants to, or would consciously choose to be a paedophile., it s similar though not identical to the argument around whether members of the lgbt community choose their sexual orientation., the obvious answer to this question of course is that they don t., now, before people get up in arms about me equating homosexuality to paedophilia, let me clarify that that is not my intention., paedophilia is not a sexual orientation., i m not an expert on the science, nor the terminology surrounding this area, but i believe it is safe to describe paedophilia as a sexual perversion., so why should we change our treatment of those affected by this perversion?, for starters, in my opinion paedophiles are not, by design, evil., a paedophile should only be described as evil once they begin to act on their urges in a dangerous or harmful manner that affects others, whether that be the consumption or production of child pornography, or worse., at that point, of course they have crossed serious, serious lines and should be duly punished., with the current systems that are in place, an individual who is unfortunate enough to become affected by such a perversion is left totally alone, with no real way to cope with or possibly even overcome their affliction., in my opinion, real investment and research should be put into systems to support paedophiles, to help them to cope with and control their urges, whether it be through therapy, medication, etc., i cannot claim to know anything about the science around this area but i assume something can be done., an important thing to keep in mind also, is that the benefits of such an initiative would be twofold., not only would it provide much needed support and assistance to possibly the most isolated and stigmatized section of our population, but even more importantly it would hopefully reduce the number of victims who fall prey to paedophiles each year., a paedophile left feeling alone, shunned and stigmatized by society is surely significantly more likely to act on their impulses and do something horrific., with the right treatment and support system in place, they would surely be more likely to seek help and try to control their condition., with a committed, well planned approach at tackling the issue of paedophilia, we could surely expect to see a noticeable fall in the horrific crimes associated with the issue.]</td>\n",

       "299935  [pretty sure this post is going to get me put on a list or something, so straight off the bat i want to categorically state that i am not a paedophile., i simply just finished watching the episode from season three of black mirror with all the paedophiles, and it got me thinking., as a society, our view on paedophilia seems to be quite simple., we don t like paedophiles, we think they re disgusting, we think they re evil, and we lock them up as soon as they inevitably act on their urges., while this stance is most definitely understandable, in my opinion it is also one that is extremely dated, and needs to be changed., the main reason why i hold this stance can be summed up quite simply: nobody wants to, or would consciously choose to be a paedophile., it s similar though not identical to the argument around whether members of the lgbt community choose their sexual orientation., the obvious answer to this question of course is that they don t., now, before people get up in arms about me equating homosexuality to paedophilia, let me clarify that that is not my intention., paedophilia is not a sexual orientation., i m not an expert on the science, nor the terminology surrounding this area, but i believe it is safe to describe paedophilia as a sexual perversion., so why should we change our treatment of those affected by this perversion?, for starters, in my opinion paedophiles are not, by design, evil., a paedophile should only be described as evil once they begin to act on their urges in a dangerous or harmful manner that affects others, whether that be the consumption or production of child pornography, or worse., at that point, of course they have crossed serious, serious lines and should be duly punished., with the current systems that are in place, an individual who is unfortunate enough to become affected by such a perversion is left totally alone, with no real way to cope with or possibly even overcome their affliction., in my opinion, real investment and research should be put into systems to support paedophiles, to help them to cope with and control their urges, whether it be through therapy, medication, etc., i cannot claim to know anything about the science around this area but i assume something can be done., an important thing to keep in mind also, is that the benefits of such an initiative would be twofold., not only would it provide much needed support and assistance to possibly the most isolated and stigmatized section of our population, but even more importantly it would hopefully reduce the number of victims who fall prey to paedophiles each year., a paedophile left feeling alone, shunned and stigmatized by society is surely significantly more likely to act on their impulses and do something horrific., with the right treatment and support system in place, they would surely be more likely to seek help and try to control their condition., with a committed, well planned approach at tackling the issue of paedophilia, we could surely expect to see a noticeable fall in the horrific crimes associated with the issue.]  "
