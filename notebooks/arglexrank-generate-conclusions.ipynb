', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]   \n",
       "3  [i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]   \n",

       "      <td>[the gender wage gap is a topic of contention in the us many conservatives denounce the gap as a myth, while liberals tend to speak out against the gap, placing blame primarily on workplace discrimination, especially by the men making hiring decisions for these companies., the wage gap, as defined by this piece, is the average difference between male and female earnings, expressed as a percentage of male earnings ., i ll focus on just the pay gap in the united states, but it s worth noting in every country on earth, men on average earn more, the wage gap in the us is currently close to 78 , meaning for every dollar that the average man made in 2014, the average woman made 78 cents., this leads to women being more likely to live below the poverty line in the us compared to men, if you are an egalitarian, or if you have a sense of justice, and forget everything else about this issue whether you re liberal or conservative this should trouble you., a person should not be more likely to live in poverty just because she was born a woman., so when a fact this upsetting comes to you, there are two very human responses., denial anger in my experience, conservatives seem to deny the problem while liberals tend to become angry about it., anger, in my opinion, actually does some good., angry people spread awareness, hold rallies, write blog posts, etc., however, anger can also be damaging to the movement., angry people exaggerate, and might attack or alienate would be allies., this next part is where a liberal reader might get upset., the wage gap where the 78 statistic comes from is an average., angry, exaggerating liberal groups often say women get 78 cents on the dollar for equal work , but the fact this, this number was not calculated by controlling for equal work ., instead male engineers and ceos were compared with equal weight to female social workers and maids., in fact, according to the u. s. department of labor, when you do attempt to control for equal work the pay gap shrinks to closer to 5, t. pdf . this still does not compare based completely equal work though, only on age, education, experience, marital status, number of children, race, and religion and the study concludes that more of the gap could still be explained by missing va, iables. the denial crowd will insist the number might go down even further if you also compared the stress and danger levels of the job, the commute time, overtime hours, and ability willingness to negotiate for higher, lary. this is all very comforting for the denia, crowd. for them, this means we don t live in such an evil, sexist society after all it s just that women make different choices than men, study different topics, and prefer a less salary focused work life, ance. however, in addition to being comforted, the denial crowd also gets a little bit angry hearing all this: why are the liberals still, elling? why are they lying claiming that the 78 statistic controlled for eve, ything? i thought this was solved, guys, why am i a misogynist for recognizing that stat is being taken out of context it s just an a, rage! ! and this next part should make the conservative reader feel a bit less at ease but the fact is, the vast majority of academics believe that workplace bias and sexism do play at least some role causing the gender, ay gap. in the words of john oliver, if someone takes a dump on my desk, the size of the dump is not th, issue. i m not going to say well, how big of a dump, is it? oh, that s almost like you didn t take on my desk, at, l! . but the most troubling thing that conservatives should be aware of, is that even if sexism played 0 role in directly causing the gender pay gap, the bigger issue is the role that sexism plays indirectly to create the gender, y gap. so lets say the gap really is only caused by women making different choices why do they make different, hoices? boys are taught from a very young age that they should make loads of money and become an engineer o, a ceo. women are taught to look pretty and become a, mother. it s in our movies, our tv even our actual lives, where fathers tend to be the primary breadwinners of the family while mothers cook dinner and change, iapers. all of these subtle pressures and more contribute the the, 8 gap. it s very possible that there have been a handful of female einsteins over time, that, if given the opportunity, could have invented a cure for cancer, a solution to the world s energy, crisis. but she didn t, because she was raised believing that science was f, r boys. so the whole world is miss, g out. sexism is deeply ingrained in today s culture in america and it s almost impossible to step away, rom it. and it s not just men guilty of it, it s wo, en too. a study was done where professors were given identical resumes the only difference was the name at the top was changed between john and je, nifer . both male and female professors offered on average 4000 more for the male ca, idate. in the case of this study, it is reasonable to assume that the employers were not intentionally giving john more money because he w, s male. what i believe happened is the professors tried their best to honestly assess what each candidate was worth, without ever consciously acknowledging that gender played a role in their calc, lation. but it happened anyway because the sexism is so deeply rooted in all of us, that we don t always realize when it s affecting our decision, aking. this silent, entrenched sexism is the scariest of all, and it will take a huge cultural shift in order to, x it. takeaway for conservatives: we all know it would be nice if there was no pay gap, or if we could explain away the gap as somehow, fair . but the truth is, even if no individual actors are behaving in an evil or misogynistic fashion, the gap itself is reflective of something very negative about our, ociety. it s best to acknowledge that, and try to understand why liberals are angry rather than denying that they sh, ld be. takeaway for liberals: sure, there are some goons at the top of the financial totem pole pulling some fucked up mad men bullshit on their female employees they should be a, rested. but by making it sound like this is the norm at your average company is going to turn off a lot of s, eptics. stick to the facts, don t exaggerate, and you ll find that you have a lot more allies than, nemies. exaggerations are easier to deny than facts, and if you want the denial crowd to come around, you can t give them easy targets of deniable rhetoric the main one being that these studies, especially the 78 one, are comparing apples to]</td>\n",

', unenlightened troglodyte: 'i don't get it., what's racist sexist homophobic etc about that? ', woke person: 'it's not my job to educate you. ', end of conversation at best, this response is dismissive of genuine curiosity and sidesteps an opportunity to address apparent ignorance., at worst, it is a thought terminating cliche that privileges a person's being offended over any possible discussion of context, history, facts, logic, and rationality., it also maintains the unappealing and ugly air of condescension and smug moral judgement, which is really not the way to win someone to your side., this is how i think the next couple lines of the conversation should go if the petty outrage didn't suppress the dialogue., unenlightened troglodyte: 'whose job is it then?

', unenlightened troglodyte: 'expect to continue being a victim of my ignorance then. ', what drives a person to stick their head out for a cause, and convey that that cause is important to them, but also deny that they have any responsibility to that cause?, why, in a situation where someone is claiming authority over the politics of a concerning social dynamic, are they unwilling to act as a spokesperson or educator for it?, if they're just lazy or want to avoid argument, then they should just say 'i'm too lazy to discuss it with you' or 'i don't have the time to talk you through it right now.

and therefore you cannot be of a gender that isn't recognized by society., i get trans women men, because they essentially are assigned to one out of the two recognized genders male female but identifiy themselves and want to be socially recognized as the opposite., non binary genders aren't really a part of society., there are no gender roles for a 'demi boy' or a 'agender' person., it makes no sense that someone wants to be recognized in one of these categories because these categories essentially don't exist to society., how is it not just a term for saying that you act outside the gender norms that wew assigned to you?, how can one identify with these genders if there is no such thing as a social product?, and if it is indeed just about behaviour how is this not offensive towards trans people?, how is this not trivializing gender identity? ?, about the 'ploy for attention' thing, i'm truly sorry if i offended anyone., as u mach pointed out, this is likely confirmation bias of my part because most of the exposure i've had to non binary people was on the crazy realms of the internet tumblr., the fact that some people are doing this for attention shouldn't mean that everyone is., i think i geniunely have a better understanding about this now., i don't doub there people exist or that their experiences are valid., i guess i'm still having some trouble with concepts, as i explained in a lot of my coments in this thread., it's not as much as i can't believe a non binary experience is real valid, but that i can't really understand how it's more than just a

       "135048  [the gender wage gap is a topic of contention in the us many conservatives denounce the gap as a myth, while liberals tend to speak out against the gap, placing blame primarily on workplace discrimination, especially by the men making hiring decisions for these companies., the wage gap, as defined by this piece, is the average difference between male and female earnings, expressed as a percentage of male earnings ., i ll focus on just the pay gap in the united states, but it s worth noting in every country on earth, men on average earn more, the wage gap in the us is currently close to 78 , meaning for every dollar that the average man made in 2014, the average woman made 78 cents., this leads to women being more likely to live below the poverty line in the us compared to men, if you are an egalitarian, or if you have a sense of justice, and forget everything else about this issue whether you re liberal or conservative this should trouble you., a person should not be more likely to live in poverty just because she was born a woman., so when a fact this upsetting comes to you, there are two very human responses., denial anger in my experience, conservatives seem to deny the problem while liberals tend to become angry about it., anger, in my opinion, actually does some good., angry people spread awareness, hold rallies, write blog posts, etc., however, anger can also be damaging to the movement., angry people exaggerate, and might attack or alienate would be allies., this next part is where a liberal reader might get upset., the wage gap where the 78 statistic comes from is an average., angry, exaggerating liberal groups often say women get 78 cents on the dollar for equal work , but the fact this, this number was not calculated by controlling for equal work ., instead male engineers and ceos were compared with equal weight to female social workers and maids., in fact, according to the u. s. department of labor, when you do attempt to control for equal work the pay gap shrinks to closer to 5, t. pdf . this still does not compare based completely equal work though, only on age, education, experience, marital status, number of children, race, and religion and the study concludes that more of the gap could still be explained by missing va, iables. the denial crowd will insist the number might go down even further if you also compared the stress and danger levels of the job, the commute time, overtime hours, and ability willingness to negotiate for higher, lary. this is all very comforting for the denia, crowd. for them, this means we don t live in such an evil, sexist society after all it s just that women make different choices than men, study different topics, and prefer a less salary focused work life, ance. however, in addition to being comforted, the denial crowd also gets a little bit angry hearing all this: why are the liberals still, elling? why are they lying claiming that the 78 statistic controlled for eve, ything? i thought this was solved, guys, why am i a misogynist for recognizing that stat is being taken out of context it s just an a, rage! ! and this next part should make the conservative reader feel a bit less at ease but the fact is, the vast majority of academics believe that workplace bias and sexism do play at least some role causing the gender, ay gap. in the words of john oliver, if someone takes a dump on my desk, the size of the dump is not th, issue. i m not going to say well, how big of a dump, is it? oh, that s almost like you didn t take on my desk, at, l! . but the most troubling thing that conservatives should be aware of, is that even if sexism played 0 role in directly causing the gender pay gap, the bigger issue is the role that sexism plays indirectly to create the gender, y gap. so lets say the gap really is only caused by women making different choices why do they make different, hoices? boys are taught from a very young age that they should make loads of money and become an engineer o, a ceo. women are taught to look pretty and become a, mother. it s in our movies, our tv even our actual lives, where fathers tend to be the primary breadwinners of the family while mothers cook dinner and change, iapers. all of these subtle pressures and more contribute the the, 8 gap. it s very possible that there have been a handful of female einsteins over time, that, if given the opportunity, could have invented a cure for cancer, a solution to the world s energy, crisis. but she didn t, because she was raised believing that science was f, r boys. so the whole world is miss, g out. sexism is deeply ingrained in today s culture in america and it s almost impossible to step away, rom it. and it s not just men guilty of it, it s wo, en too. a study was done where professors were given identical resumes the only difference was the name at the top was changed between john and je, nifer . both male and female professors offered on average 4000 more for the male ca, idate. in the case of this study, it is reasonable to assume that the employers were not intentionally giving john more money because he w, s male. what i believe happened is the professors tried their best to honestly assess what each candidate was worth, without ever consciously acknowledging that gender played a role in their calc, lation. but it happened anyway because the sexism is so deeply rooted in all of us, that we don t always realize when it s affecting our decision, aking. this silent, entrenched sexism is the scariest of all, and it will take a huge cultural shift in order to, x it. takeaway for conservatives: we all know it would be nice if there was no pay gap, or if we could explain away the gap as somehow, fair . but the truth is, even if no individual actors are behaving in an evil or misogynistic fashion, the gap itself is reflective of something very negative about our, ociety. it s best to acknowledge that, and try to understand why liberals are angry rather than denying that they sh, ld be. takeaway for liberals: sure, there are some goons at the top of the financial totem pole pulling some fucked up mad men bullshit on their female employees they should be a, rested. but by making it sound like this is the norm at your average company is going to turn off a lot of s, eptics. stick to the facts, don t exaggerate, and you ll find that you have a lot more allies than, nemies. exaggerations are easier to deny than facts, and if you want the denial crowd to come around, you can t give them easy targets of deniable rhetoric the main one being that these studies, especially the 78 one, are comparing apples to]  \n",

effected regions to the climbing numbers of non degradable plastic waste, bottled water has presented a number of complicated issues for both consumers and the environment impacted by it's effects., i believe that bottled water should possess a tax intended to impede or prevent widespread sales., these taxes would perform no differently then tobacco or alcohol taxes, with the primary goal of funding less expensive water conservation efforts and to help focus the public on using public tap water available for fractions of the cost of bottled water sources., these taxes should also be used to improve water conditions for all citizens and expanding tab sources for regions where tap water is not available or unsafe., in the event of national emergencies this tax would be reimbursed or temporarily removed to accommodate the areas needing an external source of water., a measure like this would provide increased funds to make tab and public water sources more efficient, even less expensive, and more widespread.]  \n",

god, since doing so usually means that i am telling them that their beliefs are wrong., that said, let's begin., 1., i am going to assume there is a god which is omnipotent., 2., i am going to let 'omnipotent' be 'capable of doing all actions' 3., i do not consider the 'how' of these actions., the 'how' doesn't matter., given a god which can do everything, we must allow for it to be do things which it cannot do., for example, the age old paradox of creating a boulder larger than it could ever lift., an being able to do anything must be able to create such a boulder, but would always be able to lift it, making it unable to make such an object., many will subscribe to the idea that it is a mystery, but the answer i propose is quite simple., god can't do it., it is unknowably strong, but not infinitely., such a being could create the boulder or be able to lift it, but not both., if you see an error in my logic, please show me, that i might come up with a rebuttal or award a delta., thanks, james bubble]  "
