', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]   \n",
       "3  [i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]   \n",
