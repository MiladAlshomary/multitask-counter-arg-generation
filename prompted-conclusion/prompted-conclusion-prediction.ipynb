', bannon told her., you've got to take one for the team., mattis convened a working group to study the issue and, earlier this year, unveiled a new proposed policy that would prohibit service by many transgender people., that remains on hold due to the legal fight in federal court., trump wanted a more expanded strike on syria, including striking iranian and russian forces., this could have lead to 1., mission creep., 2., a direct response from iran and russia or 3., the escalation and potential direct conflict with iran and russia., all of these potentialities would have been disastrous and were largely avoided because of mattis the pentagon., i think you can objectively agree that a more restrained response because of mattis is a positive result., gt;while mr. trump pressed his team to also consider strikes on russian and iranian targets in syria if necessary to get at the assad regime s military equipment, mr. mattis pushed back, those familiar with the decision making said., united nations ambassador nikki haley had joined mr. trump in calling for more forceful response, while mr. mattis warned about the risks that a more expansive strike could trigger a dangerous response from moscow and tehran, according to the people., more syria articles: mattis restrained trump from actually carpet bombing isis, which would have led to major humanitarian violations, needless deaths of civilians and a whole host of other issues., gt;rather than authorizing the carpet bombing against isis that trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president s desire to pull out of afghanistan, mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes., allies and democrats alike view mattis as the more restrained and measured voice in the wh, able to stand up to and prevent trump for carrying out his worst instincts., gt;'secretary mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the trump administration, and i don t mean that as a democratic partisan,' said senator brian schatz d hawaii , a member of the appropriations committee's defense panel., 'i mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the united states and the department of defense, knowing that secretary mattis is there strengthens our hand.

', my view is in direct contention to this sentiment., 'fascism' has become somewhat of a nebulous, ever changing term these days., it seems that anytime someone disagrees with someone else, the accusation of being a 'fascist' isn't far behind., for example, contrapoints begins her video with segment called 'what fascists believe' wherein she 'informs the viewer' that the three elements of fascism all relate to the protection, preservation, and advancement of the 'white race. ', in other words, she has constructed a method of identifying fascists and has redefined 'fascism' as straight up white supremacism., now, while the ultra nationalist tenet of fascism may lead to ideas of racial supremacy, it is in no way the only thing that makes a fascist a fascist, as contrapoints suggests., a white supremacist white nationalist may certainly be a fascist, but not all fascists are white nationalists., fascism has a number of tenets that are concerned with many things outside of race., what contrapoints has done is significantly poisoned the well by using her influence and prominence to re define 'fascism' as 'white supremacism' and offer the extremely presumptuous 'protip' that ''i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say' thereby making it virtually impossible for someone to ever truly denounce fascism., it is my view that this kind of dishonest rhetoric and redefinition is an ineffective way of combating fascism, an ideology that ought to be combated., the transparent sophistry only creates sympathy in the minds of those that value honest discourse for those whose ideas would otherwise deserve no sympathy., there are perfectly valid arguments to be made against fascism without needing to redefine what it is and without needing to poison the well to make it impossible for anyone we disagree with to prove they aren't a fascist., cmv., note: video link here., ]</td>\n",

things first, i am religious, i believe god created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th., but that doesn't change the fact that i personally see so many loop holes in the big bang, like what created the molecules for the big bang, and how would that ever result in life, how does that make any more sense then a god?, something has to be above science for it to be created., amp; x200b; i'm posting this because i have never gotten any actual response to this., everyone either just calls me an idiot, or 'cause science'., right now, i find no standing what so ever to call the big bang a

britain doesn't have borders that you can easily cross aside from the one in ireland., and even if one day the english channel is drained or something, why can't britain sign separate treaties with each nation?, why does it have to concede part of its sovereignty?, the laws?, most eu laws are pretty troublesome but even if they are good, why can't britain just copy them and not concede her sovereignty?]   \n",
       "415645  [i am not going to argue trump's intellectual capacity but i will say that he is extremely ignorant on the issues due to his background and unwillingness to read about and study them., that being said, general mattis and other moderate forces in the administration have prevented significantly more from harm being committed to us domestic and foreign policy by trump and his supporters in the administration., mattis opposed trump's ban on transgender people in the military and worked to subvert it., gt;but woodward reports that mattis was also caught by surprise while vacationing on the west coast and was concerned about the effects the tweet might have on service members., sally donnelly, an aide to mattis at the time, called bannon and said the defense secretary opposed the decision by trump and would try to reverse it., hey, we've got a problem with the boss, she reportedly said., 'we can't stand by this transgender decision., this is just not right., they are american citizens., these guys are coming over to get full surgery., we're supposed to pay for that? ', bannon told her., you've got to take one for the team., mattis convened a working group to study the issue and, earlier this year, unveiled a new proposed policy that would prohibit service by many transgender people., that remains on hold due to the legal fight in federal court., trump wanted a more expanded strike on syria, including striking iranian and russian forces., this could have lead to 1., mission creep., 2., a direct response from iran and russia or 3., the escalation and potential direct conflict with iran and russia., all of these potentialities would have been disastrous and were largely avoided because of mattis the pentagon., i think you can objectively agree that a more restrained response because of mattis is a positive result., gt;while mr. trump pressed his team to also consider strikes on russian and iranian targets in syria if necessary to get at the assad regime s military equipment, mr. mattis pushed back, those familiar with the decision making said., united nations ambassador nikki haley had joined mr. trump in calling for more forceful response, while mr. mattis warned about the risks that a more expansive strike could trigger a dangerous response from moscow and tehran, according to the people., more syria articles: mattis restrained trump from actually carpet bombing isis, which would have led to major humanitarian violations, needless deaths of civilians and a whole host of other issues., gt;rather than authorizing the carpet bombing against isis that trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president s desire to pull out of afghanistan, mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes., allies and democrats alike view mattis as the more restrained and measured voice in the wh, able to stand up to and prevent trump for carrying out his worst instincts., gt;'secretary mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the trump administration, and i don t mean that as a democratic partisan,' said senator brian schatz d hawaii , a member of the appropriations committee's defense panel., 'i mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the united states and the department of defense, knowing that secretary mattis is there strengthens our hand. ', senator tim kaine d va 'secretary mattis and gen. dunford are the real pillars of protecting american national security right now,' he said., 'either of them going, i think, would be extremely damaging to american defense and the credibility of our national security team. ', gt;'his departure definitely wouldn't be a positive message for us,'' said retired gen. ants laaneots, who commanded the armed forces of estonia, one of nato's three small baltic state members, from 2006 to 2011., mattis, he said, 'knows what is happening here and knows there is a russian threat., 'there's no immediate indication the defense secretary's job is in danger., still, whether his days are numbered is among the big questions doing the rounds at nato's shiny new brussels headquarters, according to two alliance officials, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue., they described mattis as one of the last remaining atlanticists in the trump administration, and the main interlocutor for european allies., mattis changed trump view on torture: gt;he won a huge one on friday, when mr. trump, in a remarkable show of deference, said that he would let mr. mattis override his view that torture could be effective in interrogations., mr. mattis is a strong opponent of such techniques., mattis opposed the muslim ban but trump ignored him., gt;but mr. mattis was also outflanked by the white house, which chose the pentagon to unveil mr. trump s executive order on immigration, a sharply divisive move in front of military leaders who view themselves as apolitical., two people close to mr. mattis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they were wary of undercutting him, said he was still sharply opposed to the muslim ban., mattis has essentially continued more moderate policies., gt;mattis is widely viewed as a force for continuity from the obama administration on some of the biggest national security issues, including iran policy and the wars in afghanistan, iraq and syria., on afghanistan and the fight against isis in iraq and syria, mattis successfully championed strategies that broadly echoed the obama administrations approaches to the campaigns and rejected trump s own impulses toward more drastic changes., in short, trump has tendencies to use the military more often and more forceful than he has, distance the us from our allies, put civilians at greater risk and generally risk starting major conflicts or greatly escalating existing conflicts., regardless of trump's knowledge of policy issues, he does have the ability to unilaterally order a lot of military actions based on nothing more than his whims., mattis is the only reason why trump has not carried out awful policies based on some of his worst tendencies.]   \n",

', my view is in direct contention to this sentiment., 'fascism' has become somewhat of a nebulous, ever changing term these days., it seems that anytime someone disagrees with someone else, the accusation of being a 'fascist' isn't far behind., for example, contrapoints begins her video with segment called 'what fascists believe' wherein she 'informs the viewer' that the three elements of fascism all relate to the protection, preservation, and advancement of the 'white race. ', in other words, she has constructed a method of identifying fascists and has redefined 'fascism' as straight up white supremacism., now, while the ultra nationalist tenet of fascism may lead to ideas of racial supremacy, it is in no way the only thing that makes a fascist a fascist, as contrapoints suggests., a white supremacist white nationalist may certainly be a fascist, but not all fascists are white nationalists., fascism has a number of tenets that are concerned with many things outside of race., what contrapoints has done is significantly poisoned the well by using her influence and prominence to re define 'fascism' as 'white supremacism' and offer the extremely presumptuous 'protip' that ''i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say' thereby making it virtually impossible for someone to ever truly denounce fascism., it is my view that this kind of dishonest rhetoric and redefinition is an ineffective way of combating fascism, an ideology that ought to be combated., the transparent sophistry only creates sympathy in the minds of those that value honest discourse for those whose ideas would otherwise deserve no sympathy., there are perfectly valid arguments to be made against fascism without needing to redefine what it is and without needing to poison the well to make it impossible for anyone we disagree with to prove they aren't a fascist., cmv., note: video link here., ]   \n",

you want to have more than a friendship with somebody then you need to take a look at yourself and consider what you can bring to the table., when i held my proto incel beliefs i didn't have much to offer anybody., i wouldn't have dated the person i was, so why would anybody else have dated me?, however, even though i have grown out of most of my past beliefs there is one that i still can't shake, and that's that women have an easier time finding romantic partners than men., i think it's just in how society is set up., i feel and do note that i feel , i don't know that men need to work harder., they need to be charming, be able to carry a conversation, be physically fit, be good looking and have a decent job., sure, a lot of those attributes are indicative of a decent personality., a man that is charming conversationalist and has a good job is probably a pretty decent guy to hang out with., and a man that has put the effort into being physically fit takes their health seriously., but these guys are everywhere., women can just pick and choose from a vast pool of decent partners and i mean actually decent, not nice guys ., in the dating scene men are expendable., none of my female friends have ever been single for any significant amount of time., it's always been 'easy' to find somebody else., and while i've never used tinder i'm familiar with how men swipe on all women they find hoping they match with somebody ., while society shits on women in a lot of ways i do firmly believe that the arena of romance is skewed to women's benefit., there are even whole industries based around men's desire for some form of intimacy., so many men clamour for the attention of women that it's possible for a decently attractive woman to sell her bath water !, this is all based on the western world, though., in places like india and china where there is a literal surplus of men i can imagine that it's even easier for women to find a partner., although, unfortunately, i'm guessing it's also more common for a woman's partner to not have been a person of her own choosing in some of those places., ultimately, however, i'm sure the issue is more complicated than i believe., so please, change my view.]   \n",
