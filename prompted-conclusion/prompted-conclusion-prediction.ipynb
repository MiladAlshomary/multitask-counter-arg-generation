x200b; rules and preferences like the ones described above often come under heavy criticism from the bi community and from the poly community., the reasoning is generally that if you're a man who doesn't mind his so having sex with women as much as with men, then you must be viewing lesbian relationships as less valid., i certainly agree with this line of reasoning if we replace 'must' with 'might'., definitely, a sexist biphobic?, homophobic?, take your pick man who believes lesbian sex is somehow lesser would be in favour of the one penis policy, and if a man advocates for one penis policy it's a reason to suspect he might be sexists., but i don't think the implication goes in the other direction: apart from sexism, there are valid reasons for a man to be more jealous of men than of women., amp; x200b; 1., different niches., sex with women is different than sex with men., at the risk of stating the obvious, both are valid, both are valuable, both can be lots of fun but they're not the same., as an analogy, if i were regularly playing football with a friend and he joined another football group, i think it would be a cause for concern: is this football group not enough for him?, are we not fun to play with?, what if the other football group is better than ours?, if he joined a basketball group, there would not be much to worry about he enjoys both sports, cool., i can see the argument going the other direction here: maybe he's not into football at all now?, depending on the personality, one line of reasoning will be more compelling than the other, and all i'm arguing is that there is a valid why someone might hold certain view, not that anyone should hold the same view., 2., different people., sorry if this sounds sexist, but women and men are different, and i believe it is valid to be more or less jealous of people based on their character., again, i'm not saying that women are in any way worse or that the differences are inherent, or that there are no outliers., but we do live in a society that treats men and women differently in their formative years and is overall quite genedered it would be a miracle if these differences in treatment did not translate to some differences in character., in fact, where there are relevant differences, it seems to me that women are superior it's quite rare to see a woman displaying toxic masculinity and women on average seem to be more introspective and have greater emotional intelligence., and when i think of my so having sex with someone else, toxic masculinity is close to the top of the traits i don't want them to have., 3., visceral responses., i think a huge part of why we feel bad about the possibility of our sos being intimate with others is social conditioning., i don't necessarily think it's right see below but i also don't think feelings are invalid just because of their origin., it also seems to me that men are very strongly conditioned to be jealous of other men, while the same conditioning does not really happen for jealousy of women now, this can very well be because whatever forces gave rise to this conditioning were in some way sexist to the extent that abstract concepts can be sexist but that does not affect my point ., of course, people might want to reshape themselves, but this is a process that takes both time and energy., so, i don't think it's unreasonable for a man to have a strong negative visceral response to his so having sex with men, have no such response in the case of women, and while not necessarily endorsing these responses or lack thereof , expect his so to be mindful of them., 4., dating experience., i'm not sure if this would be the case in a perfect society, but in the world as it is now it is a fact of life that men and women have a notably different experience when it comes to dating, relationships and sex., it's enough to have a look at any dating site., in particular, it is much easier for a woman to find a man to have casual sex with than it is for a man to find a woman to have casual sex with., it also seems that it's pretty hard for a woman to find a woman, and pretty easy for a man to find a man., it's easy to see how this would lead to more jealousy in some cases than in others., amp; x200b; in the interest of full disclosure: i'm a bisexual man significantly more into women but definitely also into men in a polyamorish it's complicated relationship with a bisexual woman., we don't have a one penis policy, nor would i want it.]</td>\n",

                  [my view here stems from 2 ideals, a personal one and a logical one., the more succinct ideal is a personal view that it is not, nor should ever be up to the government to decide what i can or can't do to my body., my logical and more detailed part of this view is on how society would benefit., drugs are currently being used at a staggering rate., and yet these drugs are illegal., as prohibition of alcohol has shown us, making something illegal doesn't erase the market, but instead creates a black market for that product., with black markets come crime, corruption and violence which adds stress on our healthcare and justice systems., as well, overdose due to drugs cut with unknown and dangerous substances and the spread of diseases through sharing needles is an epidemic that is a further tax on our healthcare system., by manufacturing these drugs and having them available for public consumption we could eliminate the spread of diseases, and prevent overdoses by controlling the whole process of drug addiction., and by this extent we're able to even help people out of addiction, instead of letting them fend for themselves.]   \n",

 [i don t understand why they re used as a political sympathy and emotional pawn., these people broke the law at there own risk and now they re paying the price for it simple as that., there are laws for a reason we re not an open border country for a reason., as a immigrant who spent thousands of dollars and many hours working to come legally i find it highly irritating that they re being defended for breaking a law., it s a different story when people seek asylum for actual reasons., this political agenda people use only makes it worse for them.]   \n",
       "487043  [it is quite common for people in nonmonogamous relationships be it open relationships, polyamorous ones, etc. , especially for 'newbies' to have gender specific rules about who their so is allowed to be intimate with and under what conditions., the most infamous of such rules is the 'one penis poilicy' i hope the name is self explanatory ., in general, for a woman in a heterosexual relationships, contacts with other women are almost always more permissible than with men., this also comes up in monogamous context just a couple of days ago i run into a thread in r amitheasshole where the op, who is in a relationship with a bisexual woman, got in trouble for saying he would not mind if she had sex with other women but was vehemently opposed to her having sex with another man just to be clear, ihmo he still was a bit of an asshole but that's not the point ., amp; x200b; rules and preferences like the ones described above often come under heavy criticism from the bi community and from the poly community., the reasoning is generally that if you're a man who doesn't mind his so having sex with women as much as with men, then you must be viewing lesbian relationships as less valid., i certainly agree with this line of reasoning if we replace 'must' with 'might'., definitely, a sexist biphobic?, homophobic?, take your pick man who believes lesbian sex is somehow lesser would be in favour of the one penis policy, and if a man advocates for one penis policy it's a reason to suspect he might be sexists., but i don't think the implication goes in the other direction: apart from sexism, there are valid reasons for a man to be more jealous of men than of women., amp; x200b; 1., different niches., sex with women is different than sex with men., at the risk of stating the obvious, both are valid, both are valuable, both can be lots of fun but they're not the same., as an analogy, if i were regularly playing football with a friend and he joined another football group, i think it would be a cause for concern: is this football group not enough for him?, are we not fun to play with?, what if the other football group is better than ours?, if he joined a basketball group, there would not be much to worry about he enjoys both sports, cool., i can see the argument going the other direction here: maybe he's not into football at all now?, depending on the personality, one line of reasoning will be more compelling than the other, and all i'm arguing is that there is a valid why someone might hold certain view, not that anyone should hold the same view., 2., different people., sorry if this sounds sexist, but women and men are different, and i believe it is valid to be more or less jealous of people based on their character., again, i'm not saying that women are in any way worse or that the differences are inherent, or that there are no outliers., but we do live in a society that treats men and women differently in their formative years and is overall quite genedered it would be a miracle if these differences in treatment did not translate to some differences in character., in fact, where there are relevant differences, it seems to me that women are superior it's quite rare to see a woman displaying toxic masculinity and women on average seem to be more introspective and have greater emotional intelligence., and when i think of my so having sex with someone else, toxic masculinity is close to the top of the traits i don't want them to have., 3., visceral responses., i think a huge part of why we feel bad about the possibility of our sos being intimate with others is social conditioning., i don't necessarily think it's right see below but i also don't think feelings are invalid just because of their origin., it also seems to me that men are very strongly conditioned to be jealous of other men, while the same conditioning does not really happen for jealousy of women now, this can very well be because whatever forces gave rise to this conditioning were in some way sexist to the extent that abstract concepts can be sexist but that does not affect my point ., of course, people might want to reshape themselves, but this is a process that takes both time and energy., so, i don't think it's unreasonable for a man to have a strong negative visceral response to his so having sex with men, have no such response in the case of women, and while not necessarily endorsing these responses or lack thereof , expect his so to be mindful of them., 4., dating experience., i'm not sure if this would be the case in a perfect society, but in the world as it is now it is a fact of life that men and women have a notably different experience when it comes to dating, relationships and sex., it's enough to have a look at any dating site., in particular, it is much easier for a woman to find a man to have casual sex with than it is for a man to find a woman to have casual sex with., it also seems that it's pretty hard for a woman to find a woman, and pretty easy for a man to find a man., it's easy to see how this would lead to more jealousy in some cases than in others., amp; x200b; in the interest of full disclosure: i'm a bisexual man significantly more into women but definitely also into men in a polyamorish it's complicated relationship with a bisexual woman., we don't have a one penis policy, nor would i want it.]   \n",

british crown is an obsolete system of government and should be abolished, their land and wealth stripped for the good of the people., taxes are spent to pay for their lavish lifestyle, pay for their marriage ceremony and travel expenses even when they are not diplomatic., they were born into a position of power they have no right to be in., they are not voted into the position and have no merit to prove it to be in the position., someone can say that the monarchy attracts tourist, but to be honest, france is the most visited place on the planet and they cancelled their monarchy long ago., also, some land in britain is still owned by the ruling family but that's not what abolishment should look like oh yeah, you don't rule anymore but you control a large amount of the land they should be stripped of their own property because everything they own was obtained by their ancestors that claimed the land and murder everyone that didn't accept that.]   \n",

', ponder this: what is it that a gay man is attracted to?, is it the gender identity of his partner, or the physical form of his partner?, i choose to believe it's the latter., there are plenty of manly women, there are plenty of womanly men, and there are plenty of trans people that gay people simply are not dating., i have to believe it's because homosexuals are attracted to the physical form i. e. , the body parts of his her chosen partner s ., in my mind, this is why they're always sleeping around with a large number of partners, and why so many of them never enter into truly committed romantic relationships., this is why so many pride parades feature dildos and bdsm gear and nipple pasties and any other degree of erotic paraphernalia, because it's not about the romantic aspects at the end of the day., it's about the sex., would love to have my views challenged on this stance.]   \n",

x200b; rules and preferences like the ones described above often come under heavy criticism from the bi community and from the poly community., the reasoning is generally that if you're a man who doesn't mind his so having sex with women as much as with men, then you must be viewing lesbian relationships as less valid., i certainly agree with this line of reasoning if we replace 'must' with 'might'., definitely, a sexist biphobic?, homophobic?, take your pick man who believes lesbian sex is somehow lesser would be in favour of the one penis policy, and if a man advocates for one penis policy it's a reason to suspect he might be sexists., but i don't think the implication goes in the other direction: apart from sexism, there are valid reasons for a man to be more jealous of men than of women., amp; x200b; 1., different niches., sex with women is different than sex with men., at the risk of stating the obvious, both are valid, both are valuable, both can be lots of fun but they're not the same., as an analogy, if i were regularly playing football with a friend and he joined another football group, i think it would be a cause for concern: is this football group not enough for him?, are we not fun to play with?, what if the other football group is better than ours?, if he joined a basketball group, there would not be much to worry about he enjoys both sports, cool., i can see the argument going the other direction here: maybe he's not into football at all now?, depending on the personality, one line of reasoning will be more compelling than the other, and all i'm arguing is that there is a valid why someone might hold certain view, not that anyone should hold the same view., 2., different people., sorry if this sounds sexist, but women and men are different, and i believe it is valid to be more or less jealous of people based on their character., again, i'm not saying that women are in any way worse or that the differences are inherent, or that there are no outliers., but we do live in a society that treats men and women differently in their formative years and is overall quite genedered it would be a miracle if these differences in treatment did not translate to some differences in character., in fact, where there are relevant differences, it seems to me that women are superior it's quite rare to see a woman displaying toxic masculinity and women on average seem to be more introspective and have greater emotional intelligence., and when i think of my so having sex with someone else, toxic masculinity is close to the top of the traits i don't want them to have., 3., visceral responses., i think a huge part of why we feel bad about the possibility of our sos being intimate with others is social conditioning., i don't necessarily think it's right see below but i also don't think feelings are invalid just because of their origin., it also seems to me that men are very strongly conditioned to be jealous of other men, while the same conditioning does not really happen for jealousy of women now, this can very well be because whatever forces gave rise to this conditioning were in some way sexist to the extent that abstract concepts can be sexist but that does not affect my point ., of course, people might want to reshape themselves, but this is a process that takes both time and energy., so, i don't think it's unreasonable for a man to have a strong negative visceral response to his so having sex with men, have no such response in the case of women, and while not necessarily endorsing these responses or lack thereof , expect his so to be mindful of them., 4., dating experience., i'm not sure if this would be the case in a perfect society, but in the world as it is now it is a fact of life that men and women have a notably different experience when it comes to dating, relationships and sex., it's enough to have a look at any dating site., in particular, it is much easier for a woman to find a man to have casual sex with than it is for a man to find a woman to have casual sex with., it also seems that it's pretty hard for a woman to find a woman, and pretty easy for a man to find a man., it's easy to see how this would lead to more jealousy in some cases than in others., amp; x200b; in the interest of full disclosure: i'm a bisexual man significantly more into women but definitely also into men in a polyamorish it's complicated relationship with a bisexual woman., we don't have a one penis policy, nor would i want it.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[i will start by saying that i am heavily drawing from my own flawed, anecdotal observations, which is why i am attempting to broaden my viewpoint on this with your assistance., i've had four close male friends come out as gay within the last ten years, and i live around and work with other homosexuals., each of them routinely post pictures on social media with ever changing groups of other gay men., only one of my friends has entered into exclusive relationships, and even then his endeavors haven't been particularly committed there was one period where he had 3 break ups in a four month span., from what i have observed, gay men tend to switch partners quite frequently, and it seems to me that they often roll around with multiple partners at once., why is this?, in my mind, homosexuality and by extension, most of the lgbtq subtypes is in fact just a sexual fetish., i am well aware that there are any number of pseudoscientific social science articles saying otherwise, but i find it hard to fully buy into social science because of it's sampling and implicit biases., not to mention that any academic who explored this idea honestly would likely end up lambasted by his peers in the current climate., anyways, just so we're all on the same page a fetish, by definition, is 'a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, item of clothing, part of the body, etc. ' a sexuality or sexual orientation is 'a person's sexual identity in relation to the gender to which they are attracted; the fact of being heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. ', ponder this: what is it that a gay man is attracted to?, is it the gender identity of his partner, or the physical form of his partner?, i choose to believe it's the latter., there are plenty of manly women, there are plenty of womanly men, and there are plenty of trans people that gay people simply are not dating., i have to believe it's because homosexuals are attracted to the physical form i. e. , the body parts of his her chosen partner s ., in my mind, this is why they're always sleeping around with a large number of partners, and why so many of them never enter into truly committed romantic relationships., this is why so many pride parades feature dildos and bdsm gear and nipple pasties and any other degree of erotic paraphernalia, because it's not about the romantic aspects at the end of the day., it's about the sex., would love to have my views challenged on this stance.]</td>\n",

                  [my view here stems from 2 ideals, a personal one and a logical one., the more succinct ideal is a personal view that it is not, nor should ever be up to the government to decide what i can or can't do to my body., my logical and more detailed part of this view is on how society would benefit., drugs are currently being used at a staggering rate., and yet these drugs are illegal., as prohibition of alcohol has shown us, making something illegal doesn't erase the market, but instead creates a black market for that product., with black markets come crime, corruption and violence which adds stress on our healthcare and justice systems., as well, overdose due to drugs cut with unknown and dangerous substances and the spread of diseases through sharing needles is an epidemic that is a further tax on our healthcare system., by manufacturing these drugs and having them available for public consumption we could eliminate the spread of diseases, and prevent overdoses by controlling the whole process of drug addiction., and by this extent we're able to even help people out of addiction, instead of letting them fend for themselves.]   \n",

for a reason we re not an open border country for a reason., as a immigrant who spent thousands of dollars and many hours working to come legally i find it highly irritating that they re being defended for breaking a law., it s a different story when people seek asylum for actual reasons., this political agenda people use only makes it worse for them.]   \n",
       "487043  [it is quite common for people in nonmonogamous relationships be it open relationships, polyamorous ones, etc. , especially for 'newbies' to have gender specific rules about who their so is allowed to be intimate with and under what conditions., the most infamous of such rules is the 'one penis poilicy' i hope the name is self explanatory ., in general, for a woman in a heterosexual relationships, contacts with other women are almost always more permissible than with men., this also comes up in monogamous context just a couple of days ago i run into a thread in r amitheasshole where the op, who is in a relationship with a bisexual woman, got in trouble for saying he would not mind if she had sex with other women but was vehemently opposed to her having sex with another man just to be clear, ihmo he still was a bit of an asshole but that's not the point ., amp; x200b; rules and preferences like the ones described above often come under heavy criticism from the bi community and from the poly community., the reasoning is generally that if you're a man who doesn't mind his so having sex with women as much as with men, then you must be viewing lesbian relationships as less valid., i certainly agree with this line of reasoning if we replace 'must' with 'might'., definitely, a sexist biphobic?, homophobic?, take your pick man who believes lesbian sex is somehow lesser would be in favour of the one penis policy, and if a man advocates for one penis policy it's a reason to suspect he might be sexists., but i don't think the implication goes in the other direction: apart from sexism, there are valid reasons for a man to be more jealous of men than of women., amp; x200b; 1., different niches., sex with women is different than sex with men., at the risk of stating the obvious, both are valid, both are valuable, both can be lots of fun but they're not the same., as an analogy, if i were regularly playing football with a friend and he joined another football group, i think it would be a cause for concern: is this football group not enough for him?, are we not fun to play with?, what if the other football group is better than ours?, if he joined a basketball group, there would not be much to worry about he enjoys both sports, cool., i can see the argument going the other direction here: maybe he's not into football at all now?, depending on the personality, one line of reasoning will be more compelling than the other, and all i'm arguing is that there is a valid why someone might hold certain view, not that anyone should hold the same view., 2., different people., sorry if this sounds sexist, but women and men are different, and i believe it is valid to be more or less jealous of people based on their character., again, i'm not saying that women are in any way worse or that the differences are inherent, or that there are no outliers., but we do live in a society that treats men and women differently in their formative years and is overall quite genedered it would be a miracle if these differences in treatment did not translate to some differences in character., in fact, where there are relevant differences, it seems to me that women are superior it's quite rare to see a woman displaying toxic masculinity and women on average seem to be more introspective and have greater emotional intelligence., and when i think of my so having sex with someone else, toxic masculinity is close to the top of the traits i don't want them to have., 3., visceral responses., i think a huge part of why we feel bad about the possibility of our sos being intimate with others is social conditioning., i don't necessarily think it's right see below but i also don't think feelings are invalid just because of their origin., it also seems to me that men are very strongly conditioned to be jealous of other men, while the same conditioning does not really happen for jealousy of women now, this can very well be because whatever forces gave rise to this conditioning were in some way sexist to the extent that abstract concepts can be sexist but that does not affect my point ., of course, people might want to reshape themselves, but this is a process that takes both time and energy., so, i don't think it's unreasonable for a man to have a strong negative visceral response to his so having sex with men, have no such response in the case of women, and while not necessarily endorsing these responses or lack thereof , expect his so to be mindful of them., 4., dating experience., i'm not sure if this would be the case in a perfect society, but in the world as it is now it is a fact of life that men and women have a notably different experience when it comes to dating, relationships and sex., it's enough to have a look at any dating site., in particular, it is much easier for a woman to find a man to have casual sex with than it is for a man to find a woman to have casual sex with., it also seems that it's pretty hard for a woman to find a woman, and pretty easy for a man to find a man., it's easy to see how this would lead to more jealousy in some cases than in others., amp; x200b; in the interest of full disclosure: i'm a bisexual man significantly more into women but definitely also into men in a polyamorish it's complicated relationship with a bisexual woman., we don't have a one penis policy, nor would i want it.]   \n",

marriage ceremony and travel expenses even when they are not diplomatic., they were born into a position of power they have no right to be in., they are not voted into the position and have no merit to prove it to be in the position., someone can say that the monarchy attracts tourist, but to be honest, france is the most visited place on the planet and they cancelled their monarchy long ago., also, some land in britain is still owned by the ruling family but that's not what abolishment should look like oh yeah, you don't rule anymore but you control a large amount of the land they should be stripped of their own property because everything they own was obtained by their ancestors that claimed the land and murder everyone that didn't accept that.]   \n",

', ponder this: what is it that a gay man is attracted to?, is it the gender identity of his partner, or the physical form of his partner?, i choose to believe it's the latter., there are plenty of manly women, there are plenty of womanly men, and there are plenty of trans people that gay people simply are not dating., i have to believe it's because homosexuals are attracted to the physical form i. e. , the body parts of his her chosen partner s ., in my mind, this is why they're always sleeping around with a large number of partners, and why so many of them never enter into truly committed romantic relationships., this is why so many pride parades feature dildos and bdsm gear and nipple pasties and any other degree of erotic paraphernalia, because it's not about the romantic aspects at the end of the day., it's about the sex., would love to have my views challenged on this stance.]   \n",
