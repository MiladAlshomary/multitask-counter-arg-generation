I don’t think it’s a double standard., gun laws aren't more strict because women are more likely to be threatened by guns. they're stricter because guns are more expensive and more dangerous to use. the difference is that guns are cheaper and easier to use, and they are easier to get. a gun costs a lot of money, and it's easy to get if you don't know where it is. a woman walking down the street is going to be), (Walking, Walking down the street cat-calling a woman is sexual harassment and should be treated as such., i think the difference between cat calling a woman and being cat called by a man is that cat calling is an act of sexual harassment. cat calling isn't. it's an act that is done with the intention of sexually harassing a woman.), (Man, Man cat-callers should be treated equally as women who are sexually harassed., i don't think it's fair to treat a woman cat calling a man the same as a man being cat called by a woman. it's not the same thing. the difference is that the cat calling is done with the expectation that the woman will be sexually assaulted by the man. the woman is being cat harassed because she's being catcalled by a man, not because she is being sexually assaulted. if the man cat calls a woman, he's doing it because he thinks she's attractive), (Pitch (sports field), Pitch (sports field) men who have been cat-called by women should be treated equally as a women who is sexually harassed., i think it's important to distinguish between what is and is not sexual harassment, and what is not. for example, it's not the same thing as being cat called in the same way as being harassed in a similar way. i don't know about you, but i've been cat called by people of all sizes and shapes. i'm not going to say that it's always going to boil down to the rules being more strict for), (Outlier, Outlier cases of cat-calling are not sexual harassment and should not be treated as such., the difference between cat calling and sexual harassment is that cat calling is an assault. it is an attack on the person who is being cat called, and it is a form of sexual harassment. in the case of cat calling, the victim is not being catcalled, she is being sexually assaulted.), (Double standard, Double standard against men in sexual harassment cases is bad for society., i don't think it's a double standard at all. it's just that there is a difference between men being cat called and women being cat harassed. in the case of cat calling, the woman is being catcalled because of her size, not because she is being sexually harassed. if she is cat called because she's overweight, that's not sexual harassment. the difference is that she's getting cat called for being overweight, and the man is getting catcalled for being a man. this is not a), (Boil, Boilers of double standards about women being cat-called by men are harmful to society and men should be treated equally., i don't think it's fair to say that women are more likely to be cat harassed than men, but i do think that it's important to remember that there's a difference between being cat harassed and being sexually harassed.)]  \n",
