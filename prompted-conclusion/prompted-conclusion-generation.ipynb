', bannon told her., you've got to take one for the team., mattis convened a working group to study the issue and, earlier this year, unveiled a new proposed policy that would prohibit service by many transgender people., that remains on hold due to the legal fight in federal court., trump wanted a more expanded strike on syria, including striking iranian and russian forces., this could have lead to 1., mission creep., 2., a direct response from iran and russia or 3., the escalation and potential direct conflict with iran and russia., all of these potentialities would have been disastrous and were largely avoided because of mattis the pentagon., i think you can objectively agree that a more restrained response because of mattis is a positive result., gt;while mr. trump pressed his team to also consider strikes on russian and iranian targets in syria if necessary to get at the assad regime s military equipment, mr. mattis pushed back, those familiar with the decision making said., united nations ambassador nikki haley had joined mr. trump in calling for more forceful response, while mr. mattis warned about the risks that a more expansive strike could trigger a dangerous response from moscow and tehran, according to the people., more syria articles: mattis restrained trump from actually carpet bombing isis, which would have led to major humanitarian violations, needless deaths of civilians and a whole host of other issues., gt;rather than authorizing the carpet bombing against isis that trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president s desire to pull out of afghanistan, mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes., allies and democrats alike view mattis as the more restrained and measured voice in the wh, able to stand up to and prevent trump for carrying out his worst instincts., gt;'secretary mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the trump administration, and i don t mean that as a democratic partisan,' said senator brian schatz d hawaii , a member of the appropriations committee's defense panel., 'i mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the united states and the department of defense, knowing that secretary mattis is there strengthens our hand. ', senator tim kaine d va 'secretary mattis and gen. dunford are the real pillars of protecting american national security right now,' he said., 'either of them going, i think, would be extremely damaging to american defense and the credibility of our national security team. ', gt;'his departure definitely wouldn't be a positive message for us,'' said retired gen. ants laaneots, who commanded the armed forces of estonia, one of nato's three small baltic state members, from 2006 to 2011., mattis, he said, 'knows what is happening here and knows there is a russian threat., 'there's no immediate indication the defense secretary's job is in danger., still, whether his days are numbered is among the big questions doing the rounds at nato's shiny new brussels headquarters, according to two alliance officials, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue., they described mattis as one of the last remaining atlanticists in the trump administration, and the main interlocutor for european allies., mattis changed trump view on torture: gt;he won a huge one on friday, when mr. trump, in a remarkable show of deference, said that he would let mr. mattis override his view that torture could be effective in interrogations., mr. mattis is a strong opponent of such techniques., mattis opposed the muslim ban but trump ignored him., gt;but mr. mattis was also outflanked by the white house, which chose the pentagon to unveil mr. trump s executive order on immigration, a sharply divisive move in front of military leaders who view themselves as apolitical., two people close to mr. mattis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they were wary of undercutting him, said he was still sharply opposed to the muslim ban., mattis has essentially continued more moderate policies., gt;mattis is widely viewed as a force for continuity from the obama administration on some of the biggest national security issues, including iran policy and the wars in afghanistan, iraq and syria., on afghanistan and the fight against isis in iraq and syria, mattis successfully championed strategies that broadly echoed the obama administrations approaches to the campaigns and rejected trump s own impulses toward more drastic changes., in short, trump has tendencies to use the military more often and more forceful than he has, distance the us from our allies, put civilians at greater risk and generally risk starting major conflicts or greatly escalating existing conflicts., regardless of trump's knowledge of policy issues, he does have the ability to unilaterally order a lot of military actions based on nothing more than his whims., mattis is the only reason why trump has not carried out awful policies based on some of his worst tendencies.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[everyone seems to be a fascist these days, at least to everyone who disagrees with them., a prominent 'anti fascist' youtuber called 'contrapoints' has a video that purports to provide methods for identifying fascists, especially fascists that are keen on keeping themselves hidden., in this video, a large segment is dedicated to the ways in which fascists obfuscate their true intentions and dog whistle to each other in order to remain hidden from the larger public aka 'normies' ., largely, this segment of the video is framed in such a way to suggest that fascists will go to great lengths to publicly denounce all elements of fascism, but in private are still fascists and work to promote fascism., she the youtuber then delivers the coup de grace in the form of this statement: 'after all, 'i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say. ', my view is in direct contention to this sentiment., 'fascism' has become somewhat of a nebulous, ever changing term these days., it seems that anytime someone disagrees with someone else, the accusation of being a 'fascist' isn't far behind., for example, contrapoints begins her video with segment called 'what fascists believe' wherein she 'informs the viewer' that the three elements of fascism all relate to the protection, preservation, and advancement of the 'white race. ', in other words, she has constructed a method of identifying fascists and has redefined 'fascism' as straight up white supremacism., now, while the ultra nationalist tenet of fascism may lead to ideas of racial supremacy, it is in no way the only thing that makes a fascist a fascist, as contrapoints suggests., a white supremacist white nationalist may certainly be a fascist, but not all fascists are white nationalists., fascism has a number of tenets that are concerned with many things outside of race., what contrapoints has done is significantly poisoned the well by using her influence and prominence to re define 'fascism' as 'white supremacism' and offer the extremely presumptuous 'protip' that ''i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say' thereby making it virtually impossible for someone to ever truly denounce fascism., it is my view that this kind of dishonest rhetoric and redefinition is an ineffective way of combating fascism, an ideology that ought to be combated., the transparent sophistry only creates sympathy in the minds of those that value honest discourse for those whose ideas would otherwise deserve no sympathy., there are perfectly valid arguments to be made against fascism without needing to redefine what it is and without needing to poison the well to make it impossible for anyone we disagree with to prove they aren't a fascist., cmv., note: video link here., ]</td>\n",

things first, i am religious, i believe god created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th., but that doesn't change the fact that i personally see so many loop holes in the big bang, like what created the molecules for the big bang, and how would that ever result in life, how does that make any more sense then a god?, something has to be above science for it to be created., amp; x200b; i'm posting this because i have never gotten any actual response to this., everyone either just calls me an idiot, or 'cause science'., right now, i find no standing what so ever to call the big bang a fact.]   \n",

', bannon told her., you've got to take one for the team., mattis convened a working group to study the issue and, earlier this year, unveiled a new proposed policy that would prohibit service by many transgender people., that remains on hold due to the legal fight in federal court., trump wanted a more expanded strike on syria, including striking iranian and russian forces., this could have lead to 1., mission creep., 2., a direct response from iran and russia or 3., the escalation and potential direct conflict with iran and russia., all of these potentialities would have been disastrous and were largely avoided because of mattis the pentagon., i think you can objectively agree that a more restrained response because of mattis is a positive result., gt;while mr. trump pressed his team to also consider strikes on russian and iranian targets in syria if necessary to get at the assad regime s military equipment, mr. mattis pushed back, those familiar with the decision making said., united nations ambassador nikki haley had joined mr. trump in calling for more forceful response, while mr. mattis warned about the risks that a more expansive strike could trigger a dangerous response from moscow and tehran, according to the people., more syria articles: mattis restrained trump from actually carpet bombing isis, which would have led to major humanitarian violations, needless deaths of civilians and a whole host of other issues., gt;rather than authorizing the carpet bombing against isis that trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president s desire to pull out of afghanistan, mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes., allies and democrats alike view mattis as the more restrained and measured voice in the wh, able to stand up to and prevent trump for carrying out his worst instincts., gt;'secretary mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the trump administration, and i don t mean that as a democratic partisan,' said senator brian schatz d hawaii , a member of the appropriations committee's defense panel., 'i mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the united states and the department of defense, knowing that secretary mattis is there strengthens our hand. ', senator tim kaine d va 'secretary mattis and gen. dunford are the real pillars of protecting american national security right now,' he said., 'either of them going, i think, would be extremely damaging to american defense and the credibility of our national security team. ', gt;'his departure definitely wouldn't be a positive message for us,'' said retired gen. ants laaneots, who commanded the armed forces of estonia, one of nato's three small baltic state members, from 2006 to 2011., mattis, he said, 'knows what is happening here and knows there is a russian threat., 'there's no immediate indication the defense secretary's job is in danger., still, whether his days are numbered is among the big questions doing the rounds at nato's shiny new brussels headquarters, according to two alliance officials, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue., they described mattis as one of the last remaining atlanticists in the trump administration, and the main interlocutor for european allies., mattis changed trump view on torture: gt;he won a huge one on friday, when mr. trump, in a remarkable show of deference, said that he would let mr. mattis override his view that torture could be effective in interrogations., mr. mattis is a strong opponent of such techniques., mattis opposed the muslim ban but trump ignored him., gt;but mr. mattis was also outflanked by the white house, which chose the pentagon to unveil mr. trump s executive order on immigration, a sharply divisive move in front of military leaders who view themselves as apolitical., two people close to mr. mattis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they were wary of undercutting him, said he was still sharply opposed to the muslim ban., mattis has essentially continued more moderate policies., gt;mattis is widely viewed as a force for continuity from the obama administration on some of the biggest national security issues, including iran policy and the wars in afghanistan, iraq and syria., on afghanistan and the fight against isis in iraq and syria, mattis successfully championed strategies that broadly echoed the obama administrations approaches to the campaigns and rejected trump s own impulses toward more drastic changes., in short, trump has tendencies to use the military more often and more forceful than he has, distance the us from our allies, put civilians at greater risk and generally risk starting major conflicts or greatly escalating existing conflicts., regardless of trump's knowledge of policy issues, he does have the ability to unilaterally order a lot of military actions based on nothing more than his whims., mattis is the only reason why trump has not carried out awful policies based on some of his worst tendencies.]   \n",

', my view is in direct contention to this sentiment., 'fascism' has become somewhat of a nebulous, ever changing term these days., it seems that anytime someone disagrees with someone else, the accusation of being a 'fascist' isn't far behind., for example, contrapoints begins her video with segment called 'what fascists believe' wherein she 'informs the viewer' that the three elements of fascism all relate to the protection, preservation, and advancement of the 'white race. ', in other words, she has constructed a method of identifying fascists and has redefined 'fascism' as straight up white supremacism., now, while the ultra nationalist tenet of fascism may lead to ideas of racial supremacy, it is in no way the only thing that makes a fascist a fascist, as contrapoints suggests., a white supremacist white nationalist may certainly be a fascist, but not all fascists are white nationalists., fascism has a number of tenets that are concerned with many things outside of race., what contrapoints has done is significantly poisoned the well by using her influence and prominence to re define 'fascism' as 'white supremacism' and offer the extremely presumptuous 'protip' that ''i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say' thereby making it virtually impossible for someone to ever truly denounce fascism., it is my view that this kind of dishonest rhetoric and redefinition is an ineffective way of combating fascism, an ideology that ought to be combated., the transparent sophistry only creates sympathy in the minds of those that value honest discourse for those whose ideas would otherwise deserve no sympathy., there are perfectly valid arguments to be made against fascism without needing to redefine what it is and without needing to poison the well to make it impossible for anyone we disagree with to prove they aren't a fascist., cmv., note: video link here., ]   \n",

incel., thankfully the incel community didn't exist back then, nor did the word itself., but i held beliefs that were dangerously close to those often spouted by incels today., i had placed women on a pedestal and was blind to my own flaws when it came to my lack of success in finding a romantic partner., i blamed it all on women not seeing what a great catch i was., all of this was internal, though., i never harassed anybody nor did i spread my views in any public space., still it took me a long time and a lot of maturing to see that women are just people like everybody else., and that if you want to have more than a friendship with somebody then you need to take a look at yourself and consider what you can bring to the table., when i held my proto incel beliefs i didn't have much to offer anybody., i wouldn't have dated the person i was, so why would anybody else have dated me?, however, even though i have grown out of most of my past beliefs there is one that i still can't shake, and that's that women have an easier time finding romantic partners than men., i think it's just in how society is set up., i feel and do note that i feel , i don't know that men need to work harder., they need to be charming, be able to carry a conversation, be physically fit, be good looking and have a decent job., sure, a lot of those attributes are indicative of a decent personality., a man that is charming conversationalist and has a good job is probably a pretty decent guy to hang out with., and a man that has put the effort into being physically fit takes their health seriously., but these guys are everywhere., women can just pick and choose from a vast pool of decent partners and i mean actually decent, not nice guys ., in the dating scene men are expendable., none of my female friends have ever been single for any significant amount of time., it's always been 'easy' to find somebody else., and while i've never used tinder i'm familiar with how men swipe on all women they find hoping they match with somebody ., while society shits on women in a lot of ways i do firmly believe that the arena of romance is skewed to women's benefit., there are even whole industries based around men's desire for some form of intimacy., so many men clamour for the attention of women that it's possible for a decently attractive woman to sell her bath water !, this is all based on the western world, though., in places like india and china where there is a literal surplus of men i can imagine that it's even easier for women to find a partner., although, unfortunately, i'm guessing it's also more common for a woman's partner to not have been a person of her own choosing in some of those places., ultimately, however, i'm sure the issue is more complicated than i believe., so please, change my view.]   \n",

       "      <td>[this is going to be a long post but it's something i've been thinking about recently, so i thought i'd share my thoughts and see what people have to say., i was spurred to write this after waking up to the notification of yet another shooting that happened in texas a few days ago., i think that almost every single bit of rhetoric surrounding mass shootings is completely pointless nonsense, or at the very least not helpful., every time one of these tragedies happen, people repeat the same talking points over and over, and yet nothing seems to be getting done politically because nothing can be done, but we'll get to that later , because this isn't a political problem, it's a cultural one; not to say that politics aren't a part of culture, or that political terrorism hasn't taken the form of blind violence as it obviously has especially recently , but repeated tragedies such as the ones that seem to be happening all around us, that strike us on such a personal level, on both the scale and volume they seem to be occurring, requires a deeper analysis on the conditions that lead people to commit these violent acts beyond 'it's the guns' or 'it's psych meds' or 'it's trump' or 'it's the news' or whatever else., first, we must identify why the common explanations for these shootings are incorrect, or at the very least ill informed, and then, we have to identify the real cause., 1., it's the news media; shooters all want to become famous., i don't buy this., now, don't get me wrong., the media has definitely played a role in the normalization of these occurrences., however, there are a number of things that people aren't putting into perspective., first of all, it's not 'the media's' fault., if it weren't fox news or cnn or some other conglomerate reporting on these things, it would be the hundreds of thousands of clickbait news article websites, social media homepages, or, you guessed it, reddit, posting about it for the world to see., massive tragedies like these are never, ever going to just be sweat under the rug in the current social media landscape and they never will be, ever again, and i'm not sure if they were to be, that it would even be a good thing., is it not ok for people to know that these things are going on, who's doing them, and why?, i think it is., now, people could argue that copy cat occurrences are through the roof because of the over reporting of these tragedies, however, it's not obvious that if all reporting ended from this point on, that people would just stop killing each other by the dozens., there have probably been a few shooters who have gone on their rampages to inspire a week's worth of cheap notoriety, but think about it: nobody who isn't already on the edge of a violent outburst, who's willing to end the lives of as many innocent strangers as they possibly can in the shortest amount of time possible, before either blowing their own brains out or spending the rest of their life in a prison cell, is going to do something like this for such a small payoff., the act itself is the motivation; notoriety may be to these people the proverbial 'icing on the cake' but it's not why they're committing the act; if that were the case, columbine never would have happened and neither would any of the shootings that happened afterwards., mass shooters are people just like you and me, they know that their time in the spotlight is only going to last for as long as the media can milk their story before the next one comes around, so i find it very hard to believe that any rational person would commit a shooting for that., now, you could argue that these people aren't rational, and it wouldn't matter to them anyways because they know their lives are going to be either literally or essentially over after the fact anyways, and that's likely part of the motivation to begin with!, you wouldn't be wrong, like i said, the reporting and copy cat culture it's created is a problem but it's not one that we can do anything about and it's not something that's ever going to change at this point, so, my position stands that this rhetoric is quite literally pointless., 2., it's because we have assault weapons and it's too easy to buy guns., i don't buy this., guns are guns are guns; you aim them at things, and then things die when you pull the trigger., bullets will kill you whether they're big or small, hollow tipped or buckshot, automatically sprayed or precisely aimed at you one at a time., the hysteria surrounding the voldemort of firearms, the ar 15, is hilarious to me., most of the people appealing to these memes have probably never shot a real weapon before or been around guns in general., you don't need an 'assault weapon' to kill a lot of people., you don't need a 'fully automatic weapon' to kill a lot of people., you don't need anything aside from bullets and good aim and anybody who's proficient at any fps game can prove that to you., there isn't as big of a difference between a 'big bad assault gun' and a 'cute little handgun' as you might think if you're not in the loop., guns can be modded extensively with scopes, extended barrels, high capacity magazines, grips, lasers, flashlights, stocks, mods that turn the gun automatic, and whatever the hell else you can imagine, so the gun that the shooters use really isn't nearly as important as things such as the targeted area they're going to attack, their own stamina and aim, and most importantly, their own resolve and resilience to kill people., making guns harder to buy won't change anything at this point: there are already too many guns in america and there'll be a second civil war before the right gives them up., plus, you can't just 'make guns harder to buy' because there are no real world, applicable hoops you could put in the way of buying a firearm that would accurately weed out violent, yet to be murderers from your local redneck., there is no minority report or psycho pass style test you could give someone beforehand to determine whether or not they're going to kill a ton of people before they do; people have this cartoonish image of what a mass shooter is, like they're all trench coat wearing, half werewolf half vampire people that you can just immediately weed out as 'evil'., you can't., then, there's the problem that even if you couldn't buy them legally by any means, there are dozens of ways to get them illegally, just like with drugs, whether it be through people selling them who already have them, organized crime, 3d printing, internet black markets, or simply stealing them, it really doesn't matter., if someone is dedicated to the idea of going six stars on some poor, unsuspecting bystanders, not having immediate access to an ar 15 isn't going to be the end of that., it may just slow them down, but it's not stopping anyone., again, nothing here is going to change because of the political gridlock this country has memed itself into, so this discussion is and will remain a fruitless one., 3., it's because our country has a lack of mental health resources for the shooters., i think this one is misguided., most of the mass shooters aren't 'mentally ill'., it's not even clear to me that people who keep repeating these memes are familiar with what the term 'mentally ill' even means, or what it implies for those who actually do suffer from real mental illnesses., a violent, rampaging outburst by some idiot with a deathwish does not automatically make them 'mentally ill'., many of the people who have done these things have written manifestos explaining in painful detail exactly why they've decided to go about doing it and seem to be rationally functioning and fully engaged in the act both beforehand, and after, if they survive long enough to make it to trial., even if this country had an abundance of mental health resources, it's not obvious that these people would just forthrightly turn their lives around, seek help, and change their minds about committing a mass shooting., people who wind up doing shit like this are usually at the tail end of a very, very, very long and depressing road, driven by resentment, anger, nihilism, and narcissism., the idea that somebody who'd commit an act like this would even have the self awareness to realize that what they're doing is clearly stupid and pointless in every way contradicts the fact that they're the type of person who'd even think that it was a good idea in the first place; there are no 'fence sitting shooters'., it only adds to the problem that the healthcare system as we currently have it set up actively discourages people from coming forth with violent fantasies., just like people who commit false rape accusations aren't going to come forth and admit that they lied because of the fear of imprisonment, nobody in their right mind is going to go mouth off to some therapist about their shooter fantasies just to get institutionalized and fed pills while wearing a straight jacket in a padded cell., at the end of the day, mental health resources like therapy and medications aren't some cure all magical pill that you can push people through like a conveyor belt to turn them into happy go lucky, functioning members of society., most people who struggle with real mental health issues are stuck in a fucked up, life long struggle, even with therapy and medication at their disposal the whole time because mental illness is indiscriminate., people condescendingly push the idea of 'therapy' onto each other all the time, especially in far left echo chambers like reddit, because virtue signalling that you're woke to the idea of mental health support makes people feel like they're somehow compassionate and progressive, despite not realizing that real mental therapy is often a horrific struggle undertaken by doctors who are dealing with patients who are so fucked up in the head that you literally cannot even imagine helping them; just because therapy helped you get over your breakup or whatever other shit you went through and felt bad about for 3 weeks does not mean that it's similar in practice or in scope when dealing with people who are nearly insane and on the edge of committing a terrorist attack., 4., it's because of political polarization and radical, reactionary positions by far right leaning bigots., i think this has some merits, only insofar as the killers admit to doing their shooting for political reasons., it doesn't explain the rest, and it doesn't explain the meta problem, which is why people are willing to go to such extremes in the first place before engaging in some other form of literally anything else., 5., it's because of bullying in schools., again, this only has merits insofar as the killers admit to doing their shooting for this reason in particular, and given that the vast majority of mass shooters seem to be at the very least in their late 20's, i find it hard to believe that bullying is the cause, not in the least because many, many, many people get bullied in school and 99. 9999999 of them don't go terminator light yagami sicko mode on their entire classroom for it., 6., it's because of video games, rock music, gay marriage, whatever the fuck else., fuck off with that dumb shit.]</td>\n",

she used to drug men in order to get them to take her home to have sex with, and then rob them, and that she would also 'truck' men into sleeping with transwomen., i am completely outraged and disgusted by this but moreso by the double standard of society that this is making apparent., in the face of a social movement on the scale of metoo, if this had been a male figure on the same scale of influence and fame as cardi b there would be absolute outrage from all corners of society, radio stations would refuse to play their music, and the male equivalent of cardi b would have their life and career be completely over, as well as likely having their victims reveal themselves and hopefully there would be legal criminal action taken against them., how us it acceptable for this woman to have acted this way?, why are people treating this horrible abuse of other humans as seemingly a joke?, why are people not as disgusted with this as we have been with, for example, bill cosby or perhaps as with the incredibly minor exanple of aziz ansari?, this speaks to an absolutely disgusting double standard and shows how little people care of the assault on men by women., i cannot believe cardi b is just going to get away with this., please explain to me why the same outrage over every other case of this sort of abuse that has recently come to light is entirely absent here?, please maybe give me some hope that some action is being taken and that this multi millionaire isn't just going to be able to get away with this atrocity scott free?, i really thought we were past this]

         [this came to my attention recently really disturbing., story is there is a 10 year old boy which has assumed the moniker queen lactatia and is now becoming big in the drag world., his mother is in full support of him attending drag shows, learning all about sex and even taking photos with 95 nude fully grown men., seriously when i saw this i naturally felt i had to contact the police however there clearly was no law broken?, my view is that children do not have the ability to think rationally yet and make sound decisions, something like this could have an extremely negative impact on someone., what if down the road he says mom why on earth did you let me do that?, the photos will be around on the internet for the rest of his life., children should have no part in this type of activity and more people should be outraged., the people in support of this claim to be progressives so we know this will only go further and further as long as it's accepted.]   \n",
       "529466  [this is going to be a long post but it's something i've been thinking about recently, so i thought i'd share my thoughts and see what people have to say., i was spurred to write this after waking up to the notification of yet another shooting that happened in texas a few days ago., i think that almost every single bit of rhetoric surrounding mass shootings is completely pointless nonsense, or at the very least not helpful., every time one of these tragedies happen, people repeat the same talking points over and over, and yet nothing seems to be getting done politically because nothing can be done, but we'll get to that later , because this isn't a political problem, it's a cultural one; not to say that politics aren't a part of culture, or that political terrorism hasn't taken the form of blind violence as it obviously has especially recently , but repeated tragedies such as the ones that seem to be happening all around us, that strike us on such a personal level, on both the scale and volume they seem to be occurring, requires a deeper analysis on the conditions that lead people to commit these violent acts beyond 'it's the guns' or 'it's psych meds' or 'it's trump' or 'it's the news' or whatever else., first, we must identify why the common explanations for these shootings are incorrect, or at the very least ill informed, and then, we have to identify the real cause., 1., it's the news media; shooters all want to become famous., i don't buy this., now, don't get me wrong., the media has definitely played a role in the normalization of these occurrences., however, there are a number of things that people aren't putting into perspective., first of all, it's not 'the media's' fault., if it weren't fox news or cnn or some other conglomerate reporting on these things, it would be the hundreds of thousands of clickbait news article websites, social media homepages, or, you guessed it, reddit, posting about it for the world to see., massive tragedies like these are never, ever going to just be sweat under the rug in the current social media landscape and they never will be, ever again, and i'm not sure if they were to be, that it would even be a good thing., is it not ok for people to know that these things are going on, who's doing them, and why?, i think it is., now, people could argue that copy cat occurrences are through the roof because of the over reporting of these tragedies, however, it's not obvious that if all reporting ended from this point on, that people would just stop killing each other by the dozens., there have probably been a few shooters who have gone on their rampages to inspire a week's worth of cheap notoriety, but think about it: nobody who isn't already on the edge of a violent outburst, who's willing to end the lives of as many innocent strangers as they possibly can in the shortest amount of time possible, before either blowing their own brains out or spending the rest of their life in a prison cell, is going to do something like this for such a small payoff., the act itself is the motivation; notoriety may be to these people the proverbial 'icing on the cake' but it's not why they're committing the act; if that were the case, columbine never would have happened and neither would any of the shootings that happened afterwards., mass shooters are people just like you and me, they know that their time in the spotlight is only going to last for as long as the media can milk their story before the next one comes around, so i find it very hard to believe that any rational person would commit a shooting for that., now, you could argue that these people aren't rational, and it wouldn't matter to them anyways because they know their lives are going to be either literally or essentially over after the fact anyways, and that's likely part of the motivation to begin with!, you wouldn't be wrong, like i said, the reporting and copy cat culture it's created is a problem but it's not one that we can do anything about and it's not something that's ever going to change at this point, so, my position stands that this rhetoric is quite literally pointless., 2., it's because we have assault weapons and it's too easy to buy guns., i don't buy this., guns are guns are guns; you aim them at things, and then things die when you pull the trigger., bullets will kill you whether they're big or small, hollow tipped or buckshot, automatically sprayed or precisely aimed at you one at a time., the hysteria surrounding the voldemort of firearms, the ar 15, is hilarious to me., most of the people appealing to these memes have probably never shot a real weapon before or been around guns in general., you don't need an 'assault weapon' to kill a lot of people., you don't need a 'fully automatic weapon' to kill a lot of people., you don't need anything aside from bullets and good aim and anybody who's proficient at any fps game can prove that to you., there isn't as big of a difference between a 'big bad assault gun' and a 'cute little handgun' as you might think if you're not in the loop., guns can be modded extensively with scopes, extended barrels, high capacity magazines, grips, lasers, flashlights, stocks, mods that turn the gun automatic, and whatever the hell else you can imagine, so the gun that the shooters use really isn't nearly as important as things such as the targeted area they're going to attack, their own stamina and aim, and most importantly, their own resolve and resilience to kill people., making guns harder to buy won't change anything at this point: there are already too many guns in america and there'll be a second civil war before the right gives them up., plus, you can't just 'make guns harder to buy' because there are no real world, applicable hoops you could put in the way of buying a firearm that would accurately weed out violent, yet to be murderers from your local redneck., there is no minority report or psycho pass style test you could give someone beforehand to determine whether or not they're going to kill a ton of people before they do; people have this cartoonish image of what a mass shooter is, like they're all trench coat wearing, half werewolf half vampire people that you can just immediately weed out as 'evil'., you can't., then, there's the problem that even if you couldn't buy them legally by any means, there are dozens of ways to get them illegally, just like with drugs, whether it be through people selling them who already have them, organized crime, 3d printing, internet black markets, or simply stealing them, it really doesn't matter., if someone is dedicated to the idea of going six stars on some poor, unsuspecting bystanders, not having immediate access to an ar 15 isn't going to be the end of that., it may just slow them down, but it's not stopping anyone., again, nothing here is going to change because of the political gridlock this country has memed itself into, so this discussion is and will remain a fruitless one., 3., it's because our country has a lack of mental health resources for the shooters., i think this one is misguided., most of the mass shooters aren't 'mentally ill'., it's not even clear to me that people who keep repeating these memes are familiar with what the term 'mentally ill' even means, or what it implies for those who actually do suffer from real mental illnesses., a violent, rampaging outburst by some idiot with a deathwish does not automatically make them 'mentally ill'., many of the people who have done these things have written manifestos explaining in painful detail exactly why they've decided to go about doing it and seem to be rationally functioning and fully engaged in the act both beforehand, and after, if they survive long enough to make it to trial., even if this country had an abundance of mental health resources, it's not obvious that these people would just forthrightly turn their lives around, seek help, and change their minds about committing a mass shooting., people who wind up doing shit like this are usually at the tail end of a very, very, very long and depressing road, driven by resentment, anger, nihilism, and narcissism., the idea that somebody who'd commit an act like this would even have the self awareness to realize that what they're doing is clearly stupid and pointless in every way contradicts the fact that they're the type of person who'd even think that it was a good idea in the first place; there are no 'fence sitting shooters'., it only adds to the problem that the healthcare system as we currently have it set up actively discourages people from coming forth with violent fantasies., just like people who commit false rape accusations aren't going to come forth and admit that they lied because of the fear of imprisonment, nobody in their right mind is going to go mouth off to some therapist about their shooter fantasies just to get institutionalized and fed pills while wearing a straight jacket in a padded cell., at the end of the day, mental health resources like therapy and medications aren't some cure all magical pill that you can push people through like a conveyor belt to turn them into happy go lucky, functioning members of society., most people who struggle with real mental health issues are stuck in a fucked up, life long struggle, even with therapy and medication at their disposal the whole time because mental illness is indiscriminate., people condescendingly push the idea of 'therapy' onto each other all the time, especially in far left echo chambers like reddit, because virtue signalling that you're woke to the idea of mental health support makes people feel like they're somehow compassionate and progressive, despite not realizing that real mental therapy is often a horrific struggle undertaken by doctors who are dealing with patients who are so fucked up in the head that you literally cannot even imagine helping them; just because therapy helped you get over your breakup or whatever other shit you went through and felt bad about for 3 weeks does not mean that it's similar in practice or in scope when dealing with people who are nearly insane and on the edge of committing a terrorist attack., 4., it's because of political polarization and radical, reactionary positions by far right leaning bigots., i think this has some merits, only insofar as the killers admit to doing their shooting for political reasons., it doesn't explain the rest, and it doesn't explain the meta problem, which is why people are willing to go to such extremes in the first place before engaging in some other form of literally anything else., 5., it's because of bullying in schools., again, this only has merits insofar as the killers admit to doing their shooting for this reason in particular, and given that the vast majority of mass shooters seem to be at the very least in their late 20's, i find it hard to believe that bullying is the cause, not in the least because many, many, many people get bullied in school and 99. 9999999 of them don't go terminator light yagami sicko mode on their entire classroom for it., 6., it's because of video games, rock music, gay marriage, whatever the fuck else., fuck off with that dumb shit.]   \n",

like harry reid involving the 'nuclear option' on the appointment of lower court judges in order to approve obama's appointments with fewer votes than were traditionally needed., we saw the results manifest themselves in the revocation of those same rules for scotus appointments when republicans controlled the senate., now, pelosi in what is purely a political maneuver, has declined to allow the president to deliver the typical state of the union address., this sets a precedent for future opposition controlled house leaders to revoke the invitation anytime an opposition president in is power., i would not be surprised at all if at some point in the future, when republicans control the house or representatives, the invitation to a democrat president to deliver the state of the union address will be revoked, possibly for even pettier reasons than pelosi is using now., to cmv you must convince me that there is some legitimate reason, other than pure political posturing, to revoke the invitation for the duly elected president to address congress and the american people, from the congressional floor, to deliver their constitutionally mandated state of the union.]   \n",

skeptical, but the more i read the more it began to make sense, i read an article where a group of researchers were able to encode physical strands of dna with malicious software, dna computer viruses, then i stumbled upon another researcher who discovered 'error correcting' code in string theory equations while he was studying quartz, electrons, and supersymmetry, i know the more we research that is done in quantum mechanics the more we're noticing the traditional laws of physics aren't applying, so where does that leave us, as our technologies improve so does our own abilities to create simulations, i grew up playing nes then sega and eventually ps1 2 and the graphics today aren't even in the same realm of comparison, from movie cgi to computer games the details are amazing, so who's to say someone hasn't perfected this and begun their own 'grandfather' simulation or a theoretical simulation on 'x. ' if the technology was so sophisticated would we be able to tell, as with all technologies glitches should be present, right, error correcting software should catch most of those and what's left, r glitch in the matrix stories, even if only a fraction of a percent of the stories are true what would that mean, what about the mandela effect, there's so much out there and of all the plausible theories on life, to me, simulation theory makes the most sense, cm]   \n",

consistent., to me, these two really large socially ideologies appear to be in contradiction with one another., to make my argument as clear as possible, i'm putting it in this format., you don't have to debunk this argument in formal form., i'm just putting it this way so you can follow my logic., premise 1: to be transgendered, one must identify with at least one distinguishing factor in regards to their preferred gender., example: i identify as a guy., maybe it is because i like to wear clothes males in our society wear., maybe it is because i like football., for whatever reason, i have some distinguishing factor which could be due to a combination of items that allow me to say my gender is male., premise 2: feminism requires that all gender roles must be abolished to reach gender equality., for there to be gender equality, male and females must be able to do any combination of things they want or they would like to identify with, without changing their gender., premise 3: all distinguishing factors between the genders become part of each respective gender's gender roles., example: if we say a distinguishing factor of being a male is working a labor intensive job, it becomes part of the gender role of males to work a labor extensive job., if the attribute is distinguishing the genders, it must become part of the gender roles too., conclusion: therefore feminism and transgenderism are contradictory ideas., i'd like it if someone got this idea in my head, but again i like to stay mentally consistent and this feels like a mental inconsistency., thanks.]   \n",

claimed the reason why he did it was to defend against ethnic and cultural replacement., as a student of war, i've been taught that the best way of winning is to not even physically fight at all., by having more children than the amount of immigrants coming into the country would be more effective than killing immigrants., there's other political benefits to having more children., the bigger the population your state has, the more state representatives it will have in the house of representatives., your state would also get more electoral votes in the electoral college.]   \n",

think there should be a short test administered on election day or before consisting of basic reading comprehension and analytical questions., it should be so easy that at least 90 of the population can pass, and it could be provided in english, spanish, chinese, and other languages., this way, people with mental disabilities, serious dementia, or those who can't read would not be able to vote, which i think would be better in helping select good candidates., i think people will be opposed to this because it limits voting rights for certain people, but i think you need to have a minimum of critical thinking skills in order to vote, otherwise you are only voting for who someone told you to do so., i know there were racist literacy tests in the past, but this should not be racially biased, and now almost everyone can read., finally i don't think it should be mandated by the federal government, but instead regulated by the states and not struck down by the courts.]   \n",

part in governing., i ve come here precisely because i don t have all this worked out, and i m wrestling with so many of the pitfalls and inconsistencies of being a non voting american., i also think i disagree with bob the printer estienne? wprov sfti1 for ending 1 corinthians 5 just after st. paul starts to get worked up about his opinion regarding politics: what have we to do with judging outsiders?, being called an outsider might sound offensive in your ears, but keep in mind that paul is actually saying that it s none of our business to judge you for your behavior., paul want referring to an inconceivable future where ordinary citizens have the right to govern themselves, but he most certainly was referring to the local judicial system which would have been the closest thing to a voice of the people but you ll have to flip over to chapter 6 for all that, won t you, bob!, not all of my political opinions are necessarily founded in scripture., our lord commanded us to render unto caesar that which belongs to caesar without ever offering us the slightest hint that there ever might be any scale for judging the morality of any particular tax rate, and frankly, i fear the government is on the brink of discovering they don t need our tax money, and then we re all screwed., as for my moral beliefs, they often run contrary to those held by nonbelievers, for obvious reasons, for what possible reason should i expect outsiders to agree with me about the things i find so clearly right and wrong?, in contrast, whenever someone learns that i m a believer, they immediately put a red maga hat on my head, and rumor has it that and a smile can render a face punchable , but if i m getting punched in the face, i want it to be for the gospel, not a wall., i m slowly coming to the conclusion that participating in secular politics by voting is an unhealthy distraction from the great commission, and i m eager to have my thinking challenged about this silly thought.]   \n",
