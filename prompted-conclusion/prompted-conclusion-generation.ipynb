', bannon told her., you've got to take one for the team., mattis convened a working group to study the issue and, earlier this year, unveiled a new proposed policy that would prohibit service by many transgender people., that remains on hold due to the legal fight in federal court., trump wanted a more expanded strike on syria, including striking iranian and russian forces., this could have lead to 1., mission creep., 2., a direct response from iran and russia or 3., the escalation and potential direct conflict with iran and russia., all of these potentialities would have been disastrous and were largely avoided because of mattis the pentagon., i think you can objectively agree that a more restrained response because of mattis is a positive result., gt;while mr. trump pressed his team to also consider strikes on russian and iranian targets in syria if necessary to get at the assad regime s military equipment, mr. mattis pushed back, those familiar with the decision making said., united nations ambassador nikki haley had joined mr. trump in calling for more forceful response, while mr. mattis warned about the risks that a more expansive strike could trigger a dangerous response from moscow and tehran, according to the people., more syria articles: mattis restrained trump from actually carpet bombing isis, which would have led to major humanitarian violations, needless deaths of civilians and a whole host of other issues., gt;rather than authorizing the carpet bombing against isis that trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president s desire to pull out of afghanistan, mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes., allies and democrats alike view mattis as the more restrained and measured voice in the wh, able to stand up to and prevent trump for carrying out his worst instincts., gt;'secretary mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the trump administration, and i don t mean that as a democratic partisan,' said senator brian schatz d hawaii , a member of the appropriations committee's defense panel., 'i mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the united states and the department of defense, knowing that secretary mattis is there strengthens our hand. ', senator tim kaine d va 'secretary mattis and gen. dunford are the real pillars of protecting american national security right now,' he said., 'either of them going, i think, would be extremely damaging to american defense and the credibility of our national security team. ', gt;'his departure definitely wouldn't be a positive message for us,'' said retired gen. ants laaneots, who commanded the armed forces of estonia, one of nato's three small baltic state members, from 2006 to 2011., mattis, he said, 'knows what is happening here and knows there is a russian threat., 'there's no immediate indication the defense secretary's job is in danger., still, whether his days are numbered is among the big questions doing the rounds at nato's shiny new brussels headquarters, according to two alliance officials, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue., they described mattis as one of the last remaining atlanticists in the trump administration, and the main interlocutor for european allies., mattis changed trump view on torture: gt;he won a huge one on friday, when mr. trump, in a remarkable show of deference, said that he would let mr. mattis override his view that torture could be effective in interrogations., mr. mattis is a strong opponent of such techniques., mattis opposed the muslim ban but trump ignored him., gt;but mr. mattis was also outflanked by the white house, which chose the pentagon to unveil mr. trump s executive order on immigration, a sharply divisive move in front of military leaders who view themselves as apolitical., two people close to mr. mattis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they were wary of undercutting him, said he was still sharply opposed to the muslim ban., mattis has essentially continued more moderate policies., gt;mattis is widely viewed as a force for continuity from the obama administration on some of the biggest national security issues, including iran policy and the wars in afghanistan, iraq and syria., on afghanistan and the fight against isis in iraq and syria, mattis successfully championed strategies that broadly echoed the obama administrations approaches to the campaigns and rejected trump s own impulses toward more drastic changes., in short, trump has tendencies to use the military more often and more forceful than he has, distance the us from our allies, put civilians at greater risk and generally risk starting major conflicts or greatly escalating existing conflicts., regardless of trump's knowledge of policy issues, he does have the ability to unilaterally order a lot of military actions based on nothing more than his whims., mattis is the only reason why trump has not carried out awful policies based on some of his worst tendencies.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[everyone seems to be a fascist these days, at least to everyone who disagrees with them., a prominent 'anti fascist' youtuber called 'contrapoints' has a video that purports to provide methods for identifying fascists, especially fascists that are keen on keeping themselves hidden., in this video, a large segment is dedicated to the ways in which fascists obfuscate their true intentions and dog whistle to each other in order to remain hidden from the larger public aka 'normies' ., largely, this segment of the video is framed in such a way to suggest that fascists will go to great lengths to publicly denounce all elements of fascism, but in private are still fascists and work to promote fascism., she the youtuber then delivers the coup de grace in the form of this statement: 'after all, 'i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say. ', my view is in direct contention to this sentiment., 'fascism' has become somewhat of a nebulous, ever changing term these days., it seems that anytime someone disagrees with someone else, the accusation of being a 'fascist' isn't far behind., for example, contrapoints begins her video with segment called 'what fascists believe' wherein she 'informs the viewer' that the three elements of fascism all relate to the protection, preservation, and advancement of the 'white race. ', in other words, she has constructed a method of identifying fascists and has redefined 'fascism' as straight up white supremacism., now, while the ultra nationalist tenet of fascism may lead to ideas of racial supremacy, it is in no way the only thing that makes a fascist a fascist, as contrapoints suggests., a white supremacist white nationalist may certainly be a fascist, but not all fascists are white nationalists., fascism has a number of tenets that are concerned with many things outside of race., what contrapoints has done is significantly poisoned the well by using her influence and prominence to re define 'fascism' as 'white supremacism' and offer the extremely presumptuous 'protip' that ''i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say' thereby making it virtually impossible for someone to ever truly denounce fascism., it is my view that this kind of dishonest rhetoric and redefinition is an ineffective way of combating fascism, an ideology that ought to be combated., the transparent sophistry only creates sympathy in the minds of those that value honest discourse for those whose ideas would otherwise deserve no sympathy., there are perfectly valid arguments to be made against fascism without needing to redefine what it is and without needing to poison the well to make it impossible for anyone we disagree with to prove they aren't a fascist., cmv., note: video link here., ]</td>\n",

things first, i am religious, i believe god created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th., but that doesn't change the fact that i personally see so many loop holes in the big bang, like what created the molecules for the big bang, and how would that ever result in life, how does that make any more sense then a god?, something has to be above science for it to be created., amp; x200b; i'm

       "415645  [i am not going to argue trump's intellectual capacity but i will say that he is extremely ignorant on the issues due to his background and unwillingness to read about and study them., that being said, general mattis and other moderate forces in the administration have prevented significantly more from harm being committed to us domestic and foreign policy by trump and his supporters in the administration., mattis opposed trump's ban on transgender people in the military and worked to subvert it., gt;but woodward reports that mattis was also caught by surprise while vacationing on the west coast and was concerned about the effects the tweet might have on service members., sally donnelly, an aide to mattis at the time, called bannon and said the defense secretary opposed the decision by trump and would try to reverse it., hey, we've got a problem with the boss, she reportedly said., 'we can't stand by this transgender decision., this is just not right., they are american citizens., these guys are coming over to get full surgery., we're supposed to pay for that? ', bannon told her., you've got to take one for the team., mattis convened a working group to study the issue and, earlier this year, unveiled a new proposed policy that would prohibit service by many transgender people., that remains on hold due to the legal fight in federal court., trump wanted a more expanded strike on syria, including striking iranian and russian forces., this could have lead to 1., mission creep., 2., a direct response from iran and russia or 3., the escalation and potential direct conflict with iran and russia., all of these potentialities would have been disastrous and were largely avoided because of mattis the pentagon., i think you can objectively agree that a more restrained response because of mattis is a positive result., gt;while mr. trump pressed his team to also consider strikes on russian and iranian targets in syria if necessary to get at the assad regime s military equipment, mr. mattis pushed back, those familiar with the decision making said., united nations ambassador nikki haley had joined mr. trump in calling for more forceful response, while mr. mattis warned about the risks that a more expansive strike could trigger a dangerous response from moscow and tehran, according to the people., more syria articles: mattis restrained trump from actually carpet bombing isis, which would have led to major humanitarian violations, needless deaths of civilians and a whole host of other issues., gt;rather than authorizing the carpet bombing against isis that trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president s desire to pull out of afghanistan, mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes., allies and democrats alike view mattis as the more restrained and measured voice in the wh, able to stand up to and prevent trump for carrying out his worst instincts., gt;'secretary mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the trump administration, and i don t mean that as a democratic partisan,' said senator brian schatz d hawaii , a member of the appropriations committee's defense panel., 'i mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the united states and the department of defense, knowing that secretary mattis is there strengthens our hand. ', senator tim kaine d va 'secretary mattis and gen. dunford are the real pillars of protecting american national security right now,' he said., 'either of them going, i think, would be extremely damaging to american defense and the credibility of our national security team. ', gt;'his departure definitely wouldn't be a positive message for us,'' said retired gen. ants laaneots, who commanded the armed forces of estonia, one of nato's three small baltic state members, from 2006 to 2011., mattis, he said, 'knows what is happening here and knows there is a russian threat., 'there's no immediate indication the defense secretary's job is in danger., still, whether his days are numbered is among the big questions doing the rounds at nato's shiny new brussels headquarters, according to two alliance officials, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue., they described mattis as one of the last remaining atlanticists in the trump administration, and the main interlocutor for european allies., mattis changed trump view on torture: gt;he won a huge one on friday, when mr. trump, in a remarkable show of deference, said that he would let mr. mattis override his view that torture could be effective in interrogations., mr. mattis is a strong opponent of such techniques., mattis opposed the muslim ban but trump ignored him., gt;but mr. mattis was also outflanked by the white house, which chose the pentagon to unveil mr. trump s executive order on immigration, a sharply divisive move in front of military leaders who view themselves as apolitical., two people close to mr. mattis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they were wary of undercutting him, said he was still sharply opposed to the muslim ban., mattis has essentially continued more moderate policies., gt;mattis is widely viewed as a force for continuity from the obama administration on some of the biggest national security issues, including iran policy and the wars in afghanistan, iraq and syria., on afghanistan and the fight against isis in iraq and syria, mattis successfully championed strategies that broadly echoed the obama administrations approaches to the campaigns and rejected trump s own impulses toward more drastic changes., in short, trump has tendencies to use the military more often and more forceful than he has, distance the us from our allies, put civilians at greater risk and generally risk starting major conflicts or greatly escalating existing conflicts., regardless of trump's knowledge of policy issues, he does have the ability to unilaterally order a lot of military actions based on nothing more than his whims., mattis is the only reason why trump has not carried out awful policies based on some of his worst tendencies.]   \n",

', my view is in direct contention to this sentiment., 'fascism' has become somewhat of a nebulous, ever changing term these days., it seems that anytime someone disagrees with someone else, the accusation of being a 'fascist' isn't far behind., for example, contrapoints begins her video with segment called 'what fascists believe' wherein she 'informs the viewer' that the three elements of fascism all relate to the protection, preservation, and advancement of the 'white race. ', in other words, she has constructed a method of identifying fascists and has redefined 'fascism' as straight up white supremacism., now, while the ultra nationalist tenet of fascism may lead to ideas of racial supremacy, it is in no way the only thing that makes a fascist a fascist, as contrapoints suggests., a white supremacist white nationalist may certainly be a fascist, but not all fascists are white nationalists., fascism has a number of tenets that are concerned with many things outside of race., what contrapoints has done is significantly poisoned the well by using her influence and prominence to re define 'fascism' as 'white supremacism' and offer the extremely presumptuous 'protip' that ''i'm not a fascist' is exactly something a fascist would say' thereby making it virtually impossible for someone to ever truly denounce fascism., it is my view that this kind of dishonest rhetoric and redefinition is an ineffective way of combating fascism, an ideology that ought to be combated., the transparent sophistry only creates sympathy in the minds of those that value honest discourse for those whose ideas would otherwise deserve no sympathy., there are perfectly valid arguments to be made against fascism without needing to redefine what it is and without needing to poison the well to make it impossible for anyone we disagree with to prove they aren't a fascist., cmv., note: video link here., ]   \n",

you want to have more than a friendship with somebody then you need to take a look at yourself and consider what you can bring to the table., when i held my proto incel beliefs i didn't have much to offer anybody., i wouldn't have dated the person i was, so why would anybody else have dated me?, however, even though i have grown out of most of my past beliefs there is one that i still can't shake, and that's that women have an easier time finding romantic partners than men., i think it's just in how society is set up., i feel and do note that i feel , i don't know that men need to work harder., they need to be charming, be able to carry a conversation, be physically fit, be good looking and have a decent job., sure, a lot of those attributes are indicative of a decent personality., a man that is charming conversationalist and has a good job is probably a pretty decent guy to hang out with., and a man that has put the effort into being physically fit takes their health seriously., but these guys are everywhere., women can just pick and choose from a vast pool of decent partners and i mean actually decent, not nice guys ., in the dating scene men are expendable., none of my female friends have ever been single for any significant amount of time., it's always been 'easy' to find somebody else., and while i've never used tinder i'm familiar with how men swipe on all women they find hoping they match with somebody ., while society shits on women in a lot of ways i do firmly believe that the arena of romance is skewed to women's benefit., there are even whole industries based around men's desire for some form of intimacy., so many men clamour for the attention of women that it's possible for a decently attractive woman to sell her bath water !, this is all based on the western world, though., in places like india and china where there is a literal surplus of men i can imagine that it's even easier for women to find a partner., although, unfortunately, i'm guessing it's also more common for a woman's partner to not have been a person of her own choosing in some of those places., ultimately, however, i'm sure the issue is more complicated than i believe., so please, change my view.]   \n",

       "      <td>i'd like to find some counter arguments because of the obvious racist implications. it seems they are two ways of using language, with differences that seem to go way beyond of what could be explained by culture. the characteristics are as follows. perhaps the more obvious is the use of tone. type a langauges don't use tone there are no words that differ only in tone and the use of tone is completely separate from the language itself. tone is only kept when the syllable complexity or phonologcal inventory are otherwise very large, and tends to be easily lost, have more the characteristics of different kinds of stress and is almost never really important for comprehension. in type b langauges, tone works in a way that is not really different from other phonemes. tones distinguish words from each other, and it isn't much harder to find words that differ in tones than it is to find words that differ in vowels. even languages with otherwise tiny phonemic inventories may have words that differ only in tones and the language may be near impossible to understand without tone. the important here is the biological factor. languages will change when adopted by the other group as it was the case with singaporean english or afrikaans , type a children will struggle with acquiring the segmental tones, while a type b child will fail to acquire the suprasegmental tone and may speak either with a flat voice or pronounce the words with idiosyncratic tones. the most improtant difference is how the langauge is used to communicate, and leads the two groups of people intuitively self segregate, as they make effective communication nearly impossible. type a speakers transmit primarily high level information. what inferences they made. type b speakers transmit primarily low level information. what was actually observed. this will make type b seem as if they are drowning the listener in unnecessary detail, that they trying to be 'poetic' or 'deep' for no reason or that they don't actually 'understand' the meaning of what they saying, and a type a person may not listen to what is being said or fail to make the necessary inferences. type a speaker will on the other hand be seen as too vague, perhaps even intentionally so and likely even unwilling to communicate clearly and hard to understand, as the low level information expected by the type b is lacking or missing entirely. second is how the language is used to communicate. type a people use a form of communication where false statements can imply truth and true statements may imply falsehoods. conversational implicature type b speakers only use this in very specific circumstances, or not at all, and trues statements can only imply true information and false statements are always interpreted as lies. the main point again here is that the difference is biological, type a children will spontaneously learn to use language in this 'creative' way while type b children will neither do that nor they naturally learn to interpret the communication of a people correctly. this of course leads both to perceive each other as persistently lying, and may be the cause of ethnic violence throughout history. there may even be some measurable neurological differences, as it seems that type a people only process language in their left hemisphere, while type b speakers use both hemispheres, so you would need to explain how can culture rewire the brain in such a dramatic fashion.</td>\n",

       "0  i'd like to find some counter arguments because of the obvious racist implications. it seems they are two ways of using language, with differences that seem to go way beyond of what could be explained by culture. the characteristics are as follows. perhaps the more obvious is the use of tone. type a langauges don't use tone there are no words that differ only in tone and the use of tone is completely separate from the language itself. tone is only kept when the syllable complexity or phonologcal inventory are otherwise very large, and tends to be easily lost, have more the characteristics of different kinds of stress and is almost never really important for comprehension. in type b langauges, tone works in a way that is not really different from other phonemes. tones distinguish words from each other, and it isn't much harder to find words that differ in tones than it is to find words that differ in vowels. even languages with otherwise tiny phonemic inventories may have words that differ only in tones and the language may be near impossible to understand without tone. the important here is the biological factor. languages will change when adopted by the other group as it was the case with singaporean english or afrikaans , type a children will struggle with acquiring the segmental tones, while a type b child will fail to acquire the suprasegmental tone and may speak either with a flat voice or pronounce the words with idiosyncratic tones. the most improtant difference is how the langauge is used to communicate, and leads the two groups of people intuitively self segregate, as they make effective communication nearly impossible. type a speakers transmit primarily high level information. what inferences they made. type b speakers transmit primarily low level information. what was actually observed. this will make type b seem as if they are drowning the listener in unnecessary detail, that they trying to be 'poetic' or 'deep' for no reason or that they don't actually 'understand' the meaning of what they saying, and a type a person may not listen to what is being said or fail to make the necessary inferences. type a speaker will on the other hand be seen as too vague, perhaps even intentionally so and likely even unwilling to communicate clearly and hard to understand, as the low level information expected by the type b is lacking or missing entirely. second is how the language is used to communicate. type a people use a form of communication where false statements can imply truth and true statements may imply falsehoods. conversational implicature type b speakers only use this in very specific circumstances, or not at all, and trues statements can only imply true information and false statements are always interpreted as lies. the main point again here is that the difference is biological, type a children will spontaneously learn to use language in this 'creative' way while type b children will neither do that nor they naturally learn to interpret the communication of a people correctly. this of course leads both to perceive each other as persistently lying, and may be the cause of ethnic violence throughout history. there may even be some measurable neurological differences, as it seems that type a people only process language in their left hemisphere, while type b speakers use both hemispheres, so you would need to explain how can culture rewire the brain in such a dramatic fashion.   \n",
