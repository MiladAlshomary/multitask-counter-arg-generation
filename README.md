# multitask-counter-arg-generation
An multi-task approach for generating counter-arguments

# Todo list:
- Collecting argument/counter-arguments from kialo platform
- Integrate a stance classification component to the generation models to insure the generated counter-claim has the opposit stance.
- Integrating common-sense knowledge to the generation process
- Counter-argument evaluation: Extending the summary-explorer tool with measures to evaluate the quality of a counter-argument (eg. argumentativeness, opposit stance, dieveristy of covered aspects, etc.)
