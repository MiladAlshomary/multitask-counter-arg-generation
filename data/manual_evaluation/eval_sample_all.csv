t3_bu5s4p," abortion is murder and should be legal : to start, i m a catholic who would never get an abortion due to an accidental pregnancy. however, there are countless cases where abortion is necessary. if the mother s health is deteriorating due to the pregnancy, abortion is necessary to keep her alive. at that point, the baby can t live on its own, but the mother can, as long as she is no longer pregnant. further, if the child will die upon being born or is brain dead, then an abortion should be performed because pregnancy is dangerous and there s no point in carrying out something that could hurt the mother when there s literally no payoff for having the child because it could never live. if the pregnancy is caused by rape or incest, the emotional toll on the mother could be extremely substantial and no one has the right to declare that a woman be put through that constant pain. i would get an abortion for any of the above reasons. however, other people want to get abortions for accidental pregnancies. they want to get abortions because they can t afford the pregnancy, let alone raising the child. they want to get abortions so they can keep up in a competing field. they want to get abortions so they won t have disabled kids. they want to get abortions simply because they don t want kids. while i personally disagree with doing this, i do not know what their lives are like and cannot accurately judge them. neither can any politician. plenty of murders are legally justified in cases of self defense and i think abortion should be included, because it s practically the definition of self defense. someone is going to seriously harm, kill, or ruin your life, so you have the right to choose to kill them. i m not saying that i like the idea of killing a fetus, but it s justifiable, and laws are supposed to be just.","abortion is a medical procedure, not a medical necessity. if a woman is pregnant, she has a right to choose to abort. if she doesn't want to have the baby, she should be able to do so. abortion is not a choice, it is a necessity."
,,"i don't think it's fair to use self defense as a justification for abortion. self defense is the act of killing another human being. abortion is the action of killing a human being for no other reason than that it is in the best interest of the mother. you can argue about whether or not the mother's health is deteriorating due to the pregnancy, but that doesn't change the fact that the fetus is not in danger of dying."
,,"the problem with this is that it violates the first amendment, which protects the right to life of the mother. the fetus is not a human being, and it does not have a right to exist outside of the womb. it is a part of the woman's body, and her body has no right to harm it."
,,"i'm a catholic who would never get an abortion due to an accidental pregnancy. i believe that abortion should be legal in cases where the mother's health is deteriorating due to the pregnancy, or if the fetus is not viable and the mother is in danger of dying. i don't believe that the fetus should have the same rights as the mother, but i do think that it should be allowed to exist."
t3_axbo12," We should stop using the word ""green"" in environmentalism messaging : i strongly believe the continued use of the word 'green' in branding the message of environmental conservation is hurting, rather than helping. amp; x200b; for example, the green new deal bill currently being discussed in the u. s. congress. the term green is outdated and calls to mind going green and an old 1990 s way of approaching environmentalism, where it was a new, cool thing to do . amp; x200b; this type of 'green' environmentalism is often lampooned much like the word environmentalism itself. the goofiness of these parodies undermines the severity of the issue. because of the potential worldwide crisis of climate change, and the potential devastation that could destroy our species and many others, i think the messaging calls for stronger language that everyone can really get behind. something more about surviving, rather than going greeeeen! ' even the anti environmentalist crowd of super conservative survivalists might be able to get behind the survival branding, rather that the 'going green' branding. amp; x200b; i have reached out to many people about this and received no feedback. so this makes me wonder if this is not as big of a deal as i think it is. can someone change my view, that 'green' is a perfectly good primary word to use to brand the cause of environmentalism?",the word 'green' is not outdated. it has been used for a long time to refer to environmental conservation efforts. it's been used as a synonym for environmentalism since the 1970s. there is no reason to stop using it.
,,"i think the word 'green' is outdated because it's not a new word. it's been around since the 1970s, and has been used to describe environmentalism since the 1960s. it has always been used as a shorthand for environmentalism, and it's still used to refer to environmentalism today. i don't think it's hurting the message of environmental conservation, but it's certainly not helping it."
,,"'green' is a perfectly good word to describe environmental conservation. it's not a new word, it's been around for a long time, and it has been used in a wide variety of contexts and contexts. the word 'green' has a long history of being used as a shorthand for environmental conservation, and is often used as an umbrella term for a wide range of environmentalism."

t3_alw8zj," Two-Tier Healthcare can work in Canada (specifically Ontario) : so while i don't like labels, if you made label myself i'd definitely say i'm on the left, probably more so than a typical liberal party in canada far more left than the democratic party in the us . i believe strongly that the public should have access to resources that make it easier for them to work and contribute to the economy. education should be free, i support free daycares so parents can work without feeling like they are in quicksand, etc. i 100 believe all citizens should have the right to healthcare and no one should have to pay for it in a time of emergency, it should be covered by our taxes. however, i also believe if people want to pay money for healthcare in addition to their tax dollars, they should be able to. so to be clear, i do not believe anyone who seeks private healthcare should receive any tax benefits. if you seek private healthcare, that is your own choosing and it's done completely on your own dime. but if that's something you choose to do, you should be able to. when i bring this up with other canadians, they typically react very negatively and point to the us as an example of a failure of private healthcare. i personally agree that the us healthcare system is awful, and if i had to choose between what the us has and what canada has, i'd choose canada every single time . i love canadian healthcare. however, i do think it can be improved with two tier. here's the analogy i think of. canada allows for two tier education. we have public schools, but parents can also choose to send their kids to private school. now, imagine all private schools were to close down today. every student in private school would need to be moved into the public sector. but now the large class sizes we have are going to get even larger. we need more classrooms, more resources, etc for all the new incoming students. it puts a larger strain on our education system and ends up hurting everyone's education. i imagine two tier healthcare to be the same, but in reverse. by allowing for private healthcare, you can take some of the strain off of hospitals and doctors offices, but i wouldn't reduce the spending, but use the reduced strain to further fund the institutions we have. yes, the us shows the danger of private healthcare, but two tier healthcare is used throughout europe. the uk, france, singapore, and many others have various forms of two tier healthcare. now, while this was brought on by the news of the ford government leaking info, i should make it clear i do not trust the ford government to make two tier healthcare work. ford is an incompetent buffoon. but i do think two tier healthcare can work, and should be adopted in some capacity.","private healthcare is not the same as public healthcare. public healthcare is the same because it is the only option available to the people. private healthcare is only available to those who can afford it, and it is not available to anyone else. that is not to say that there is no benefit to public healthcare, because there is, but there is not."
,,"the problem with two tier education is that it makes it more difficult for parents to get their kids into a good school. in a two tier system, parents would be forced to pay more for their kids to go to a private school, which would make it harder for them to get a good job, and it would be more difficult to get them into a better school. this would also mean that there wouldn't be enough teachers to teach all the kids in the district, which"

,,"the problem with the us healthcare system is that it's not a two tier system, it's a single tier system. canada has a single payer system, but it's much better than the us system, because they have universal health care. the us has two tiers, but they're not two tiers because they're two levels of the same system."

t3_c5ahoq," If states make car insurance compulsory, they should provide a not-for-profit insurance service : cars are a must for the sweeping majority of the american population. 49 out of the 50 states require you to have liability insurance, and the 50th requires it if you can't pay out of pocket for a crash. state governments should provide their own version of barebones liability coverage at prices that are enough to cover operating costs, and surpluses should be returned to the buyers consistent to how much they pay. doesn't mean private providers shouldn't exist, but they shouldn't be the only option.","cars are a necessity for the sweeping majority of the american population. the vast majority of people are too poor to afford a car, and they don't have the means to buy a car. they can't afford to drive a car if they can not afford it."

t3_bbn5tv," It is likely Republicans will continue to control the US Government Indefinitely : back in 2012, after the election, i remarked to a friend that 2016 would be the most important election of my lifetime because the party in power would be in a position to set up an indefinite control of the government come 2020. my view is that the republican party currently controls the us government and will continue to control the us government for the indefinite future. how long that future will be is hard to predict. maybe eight years, maybe twenty, maybe more. there may be a brief gap period. but the future will be republican. i base this position on the following: 1. donald trump will win 2020 and maintain control of at least one half of congress, likely both. as the incumbent trump enjoys the incumbent advantage. he has a reliable base that will not break from him and consistently votes. he has at best done nothing to protect our voting systems and at worst sought to weaken protections. his opponents are currently fairly divided although we are still very far out but none seem likely to inspire both the left to vote and independents to vote with them. and even if trump is unpopular it does not matter because the unpopularity is geographically restricted compared to his rural support. the electoral college is once again likely to seal a win even if he does not win the popular vote. 2. republicans will control the 2020 census. due to the above, if trump is re elected republicans will control the 2020 census and redistricting. they will, as they have in the past, gerrymander the country in their favor as much as possible. alternatively, if the census is sabotaged in some way, the current districts, favoring republicans, will continue to be used. thus, for the next decade, elections will continue to favor republicans based on districts. and the supreme court is not likely to strike down gerrymandering any time soon. 3. the urban rural divide favors republicans. republicans enjoy rural support while democrats enjoy more urban support. the problem is that while urban support has a higher population, rural support is geographically wider. the senate is designed as an institution to favor smaller population states, and as much as i dislike the republican control of it it is nonetheless doing just that. the house, however, is not able to counterbalance the senate because it is capped. the house is meant to represent population and favor more populous states, but with a cap in place is no longer able to effectively do so. more rural states are favored in both parts of congress. further, the house can be gerrymandered where the senate cannot. a greater population favoring democrats in smaller urban areas is simple to manipulate to create as many rural and thus republican districts and representatives as possible with as few urban districts and democrats as possible. the joint effect of 2 and 3 cannot be understated, as it ensures that, even if democrats win the presidency and a unified congress somehow it is likely to be quickly re lost come the next election, where the presidential party is already predisposed to endure losses. 4. the courts. if the republicans hold power in 2020 it is unlikely that all the aging liberal justices will survive until the next election, granting republicans the ability to further solidify the supreme court as conservative. more subtly, an enormous portion of the lower federal court judges are conservative to far right, a number increasing as judges are passed through the senate. the combined power of the conservative justice system will be to neuter any left wing legislation that a democratic government may pass, removing as many democratic policy victories and further portraying democrats as inept. notably this is likely to occur even if democrats win in 2020, as the judiciary is already stacked against them. there is, of course, the possibility democrats will win the presidency and at least one half of congress. then all bets are off. but i am doubtful. disproving the above points would go a long way towards changing my view, although changing just one or so would likely be insufficient as they are pretty interconnected. this is not a debate on what the actual policy effects of an indefinite republican government will be, although i fear they will be catastrophic. and while i have no doubt trump, should he win in 2020, will do everything he can to further consolidate power either for himself personally or for republicans that is also outside the scope of this cmv. and please don't talk about winning and controlling state governments in a federal system, i am referring to the federal government in this cmv. adding state governments would make this too vast.","the united states is a democratic republic, not a republic. the republicans are the ones who control the federal government, not the democratic party. the democrats are in power, but they are not in control of the us government. the republican party is in power because they control the legislative branch, not because they are the people."
,,"the gerrymandering is not the only thing that will change over the next few years. the electoral college is designed to favor smaller population states, not to favor larger ones. the house of representatives and senate are designed to represent the interests of the people, not the people themselves. the supreme court is not going to change that."
,,"i don't think it's fair to say that the next election will be the most important election of my lifetime. i think we can all agree that trump will win the election, but that doesn't mean that the republican party will control the government for the foreseeable future."
,,"i'm not sure i can change your view on gerrymandering, but i think it's fair to say that it's unlikely that republicans will control the 2020 census and redistricting. the supreme court has ruled that the census is unconstitutional, but it doesn't mean that it will continue to be unconstitutional for the rest of the decade. if the senate is controlled by republicans, and the house by democrats, then it's likely that democrats will have a"

t3_d5yaxm," US Social Security will be financially sustainable, if a little reduced, for decades to come : i've seen several people recently who feel that us social security ssi and ssdi will not be sustainable over the next few decades, and that we should stop the program before going into further debt, or pass implementation on to the states source i disagree. i do acknowlege that social security is projected to deplete its trust fund by 2035 if congress doesn't make any changes. but interest from investing this trust fund only funds 10 of social security. most of the funding 88 comes from the payroll tax that us workers pay on their income. and this is never going away even if the ratio of retirees to workers gets higher over the next couple of decades, there will always be workers. worst case scenario social security will end up being funded only by the payroll tax and a little bit of tax on the benefits themselves. the latest trustees' report predicts a 23 reduction in payouts once this happens. as far as i know, there's no chance that keeping this program afloat would add to the national debt. we should definitely look at reforms to try to keep payouts at their current level some candidates propose raising the cap on earnings taxed for social security , but the program is not unsustainable by any means. in fact, it's one of the most effective ways the us has ever combatted poverty. according to a study by the census bureau it's keeping 22 million americans, mostly seniors, above the poverty line. anyway, looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks!","social security is not sustainable. it is not a social safety net, it is a social security program that provides a safety net for the elderly and disabled. without social security, the elderly would not be able to get the benefits they receive, and the disabled would be unable to receive the services they need."

'replaced' cap and trade with a program that rewards businesses who pollute a tiny bit less with a major tax cr the 'fiscally responsible' opc party's plan to replace the program that brought in money to punish polluting companies was to give out money to companies who show a reduction in emissions. they succesfully replaced a revenue with an expense, leading to more taxpayer money spent, which increases the defecit they're so worried about. cancelled the minimum wage increase: there was a plan in place to increase minimum wage to 15 hr from 14 hr, which would have lead to more income tax being collected and less people requiring government assistance. promised every minimum wage earner a tax cras a way to replace the minimum wage increase: again, removing a revenue stream. instead of collecting money from more income taxes, they're giving minimum wage earners an 800 per person tax cr, which with 1. 57 million workers making minimum wage, is 1. 26 billion no longer going in to the governments pocket. proposed a plan to use taxpayer money to take down existing electric vehicle charging stations: they actually did this. i don't even have to explain it. spent taxpayer money fighting the federal government on a carbon tax: feds from the beginning said they'll be introducing a carbon tax and that any province who denied to comply would have one forced into them. another province tried to fight them and, guess what, had it forced on to them. be using taxpayer money to pay lawyers to fight doug ford's ongoing legal battle with his brothers widow: doug ford's brothers widow is suing him, for what i'm not sure, but she's suing doug ford, and from what i've heard, this one i'm not sure of he is using taxpayer money to fund the lawyers defending him. be using taxpayer money to fight doug ford's ongoing legal battle with 7 other entities: see above. just allowed mpps a 20 increase in their housing allowance right after cancelling rent control and reducing disability housing benefits by 5 : 'we can't afford to pay people's rent for them. wait, rent is really high, here politicians have a tax crfor housing.

t3_cpi55k," It makes more sense to treat utilitarianism as a rubric for other moral theories than its own theory. : utilitarianism the idea that the moral worth of an action depends on its ability to promote vs impede overall happiness. first off, i don't think there is an actual objective morality, but i do think it makes sense to have 'morals' because they accomplish a goal of creating a functioning society that makes living more enjoyable than it would be if there weren't one. i think this goal 'creating a functioning society' exists because that's what makes people happier. i'd argue that utilitarianism is almost truistic in that sense. of course it makes sense to improve overall human happiness because that's literally the only metric we can even use. this is embodied by all the counterarguments to utilitarianism. the first being: 'it is difficult to quantify utility. ' this is true, but this argument basically boils down to 'utility is subjective and not the same for everyone, therefore impossible to truly measure'. i'd agree, but this is not a criticism of utilitarianism, more a criticism of moral theories in general. but i've already acknowledged that morality is not objective, so this is not an effective counterpoint. in fact, that is what i'd argue the other moral theories are for. they provide maxims that will in general lead to the effect of utilitarianism or, as im arguing, when done right they do . second: 'utility ignores justice' this is only true up to the point that justice does not effect happiness. if you are saying utilitarianism can't be correct because people wouldn't want to live in an unjust world and that would make them unhappy, you have missed the point of utilitarianism, because if people in general aren't as happy as they could be, that isn't utilitarianism. you could also use this counterargument for: 'you could argue for slavery or thanos killing half the planet or any number of situations if you accept utilitarianism' going along with the above point, no you can't because those aren't examples of actual utilitarianism, they are examples of people not understanding the utilitarian counterarguments for this. in theory, if the society where everyone is happiest involved slavery, then yes, slavery would be ok, but based on what we know about slavery and its effects, this isn't worth considering, and a bad counter to utilitarianism. same with thanos. if you have all the stones, and the best plan you can come up with is killing half of everyone, that's not a criticism of utilitarianism, that's a criticism of one person having enough power to enact their extremely short sighted plan. so there you have it. i think the entire goal of having moral discussions on a large scale is basically to achieve utilitarianism. also most counterarguments against utilitarianism seem to appeal to utilitarianism. therefore, a moral theory's 'correctness' depends on how much like utilitarianism it is. cmv.","utilitarianism is a form of utilitarianism. utilitarianism is not a philosophy, it's a set of rules that can be applied to all situations. the problem with utilitarianism isn't that it's impossible to quantify utility, the problem is that it doesn't make sense to do so. if you look at the definition of utility, utilitarianism makes no sense at all. it's not that utilitarianism doesn't exist, it just doesn't apply to every situation."
,,"utilitarianism is a set of principles that can be applied to any action. it can be used to justify all actions, but it can also be used as a framework for how to deal with situations where it is impossible to quantify utility. it's not hard to argue that utilitarianism is wrong because it is not an objective system, but that doesn't mean that it can't be useful. the problem with utilitarianism isn't that it is subjective, it's that it"
,,"i don't think it's possible to quantify utility, because utility is subjective. it's not possible for us to quantify happiness, because we have no way of knowing what is best for a given person. the only way we can quantify utility is if we are able to quantify how much happiness a person is able to have, which is not the case with utilitarianism."
,,"the problem with utilitarianism is that it is not based on the ability to achieve overall happiness. it is based on utilitarianism as a set of rules that must be followed to achieve happiness. if you want to improve overall human happiness, you have to make sure that people are happy in the first place. if they are not happy, then you can't have a society where everyone is happy. the only way to achieve that is to create a society that is happy for everyone"

t3_a6tarh," Aside from water quality concerns in some locales, the best faucet design is the single-handle type that you rotate for temperature. : multiple time commenter, first time poster, trying this out with a topic i hope is a little interesting. i've been thinking about this a lot since moving into a different apartment. it really bothers me that a lot of the faucets nowadays are of the two handle type, where you have to twist pull each one to get a water temperature between perfectly hot and perfectly cold. you have to pull and push each handle, and just when you get the temperature right, the pressure might be wrong for what you're doing, and you either can't wash dishes your hands whatever effectively or water sprays everywhere. i miss the faucets of the type that some kitchen sinks still use, where there is a single knob you pull out push in to change the water pressure and twist to change the temperature. you can turn it on and immediately have it trying to dispense the water temperature you want; and you can adjust the water temperature with one hand without changing the pressure, which is good for again washing dishes. worse yet is what our tubs in our new place have, which is a weird onion like twist for pressure and twist for temperature. you have to really turn it to get any water going, and you have to twist the back thing to change the pressure, which seems kind of dangerous since the temperature adjustment is a fairly flimsy plastic disk with, like, cog teeth. the damn thing flexes if you try to twist it from the wrong angle, and the plastic edges on the back are downright sharp if you've been soaking in the tub. seems very dangerous. but i digress. also, i'm aware that it's a legal requirement in some places like the uk that the hot and cold water taps be separated, because of regulations covering cold water being different from those regulating hot water. this is why i included that caveat in the title.","i don't think that faucets are any better than they used to be, but i do think that they are more efficient than they were in the past. the faucet was designed to be able to adjust the water temperature by pulling on the handle and twisting the handle at the same time, which is much easier than twisting and pulling at the handle. if you twist the handle you can adjust the pressure and adjust the temperature, but you can't change the pressure"

t3_an2rsr," The Result of the McDonald's Coffee Case Was, Indeed, Ridiculous : hey cmv. since i'm in this debate again, i'd love to put it to expert view changers, because i've never found myself sufficiently challenged. it's become very in vogue to talk about the mcdonald's coffee case not as an example of a frivolous lawsuit, but as an example of corporate spin making a poor, injured woman into a laughing stock in order to save their image and push for tort reform. this came about partly due to the documentary, 'hot coffee. ' case most of the claim seems to be, 'people didn't really know how truly awful her injuries were. ' and they were. it's also pointed out that liebeck originally only wanted the 20,000 dollars for her medical bills. which is true, she did ask for that, and maybe mcdonald's should have just swept the thing under the rug and been done with it. but none of this means the outcome of the case wasn't overly punitive. that her injuries were horrifying doesn't mean mcdonald's was to blame. mcdonald's manual said to keep and serve brewed coffee from 180 190 degrees. see: hot coffee link . there is some discrepancy on what temperature to serve coffee but some put it within about this range: most put it somewhere in the 150 175 degree range. the wikipedia page for the case says that mcdonald's hasn't much lowered its serving temperature, and starbucks serves coffee at temperatures about that hot though, notably, nowhere did i find the '190 degree maximum' suggested in mcdonald's manual suggested . v. mcdonald 27s restaurants coffee temperature water at 156 degrees can cause 3rd degree burns in 1 secon . at 140 degrees, it takes 5 seconds, according to this: i found similar numbers elsewher . it was pretty surprising to me, but i saw such claims again and agai . interesting to note, though, the 'hot coffee' link says it would take 3 7 seconds for water at 180 190 degree . not sure where those numbers come fro . at first these numbers seem to weaken their case that gives people al ot of time to get away from the burn , but i actually think it was done to strengthen it, because the point they are trying to make is 'colder temperatures wouldn't have burned as quickly,' and the more time they allow her to get out of her sweatpants she was an 80 year old woman, in a car the bette . however, the links and research seem to contradict the 3 7 second . apparently scalding occurs in 1 second at 156 degrees you might say 'that's direct skin contact, she was in sweatpants,' to which i say, wearing sweatpants, at the moment, about to exercise, it's gonna soak through to get to the ski hot coffee also makes note that in the 10 years prior to the case, 700 people complained to mcdonald's about their coffee temperature, and so, should have know . currently they serve 1 billion cups of coffee a year . let's lower that rate drastically and say that in the 10 years from '82 '92, they served 2 billion cups of coffe . 700 in 2 billion is statistically nothing . that's 1,999,999,300 one billion nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred ninety nine thousand three hundred people who did not complain about or suffer burns by the company's coffe . let's say it was only 1 billion cups in ten year . or 500 millio . or 1 millio . 700 people is a statistic insignificanc now, i'm not saying mcdonald's is totally off the hoo . their cups very well might not have been as sturdy as they ought have bee . and their temperatures were at the high en . however mostly it seems like these burns were bound to happen once this women spilled, unless we mandate that companies sell coffee at temperatures low enough for 80 year old women to have the time to get out of their sweatpants should they spill on their laps before third degree burns occur, and frankly, if those stats about scalding are correct, i don't think anyone really wants coffee served that col","i don't think it's more effective as a public relations argument than a private industry one. the fact that she didn't want to go through the motions of suing mcdonald's doesn't make it any less effective, it just means that it's not as effective as it could have been."

t3_ahpd14," Democrats Trading DACA for Building the Wall Would Be Another Awful Mistake By the Democrats : daca for the wall funding is beginning to reappear in the media as a potential way for this government shutdown to end. i think that this would be an awful political mistake by the democrats if they were to accept this offer. they should not budge on funding for trump's wall as they have all of the leverage in this fight. the following issues listed below are why i think the democrats would be stupid to support wall funding. 1. democrats currently hold all of the political leverage in this fight. if trump gets the wall funding, his primary campaign promise will be fulfilled. if trump is not able to build the wall, he will lose the support of some right wing talk show hosts which will likely erode some of the support he gets from his base. no wall funding makes trump's reelection campaign much more of an uphill battle. 2. this type of solution would ultimately provide trump what he wants based on him shutting down the government. i think that this is a problem and a negative for this potential idea. 3. daca is just one issue that will be discussed in future immigration negotiations and probably solved in those negotiations . immigration will likely be addressed in one massive piece of legislation like we saw under reagan in the 80's as this gives both parties different pieces of policy to trade back and forth in negotiations. for the democrats, there is daca and 'asylum' or a pathway to lpr for the 30? million illegal immigrants currently in the country, along with overhauling the system to make the immigration process more efficient shorter wait times and more robust more legal immigrants accepted into the us to begin the process of becoming a citizen every year . for the gop there is primarily border security, reducing the amount of immigrants chosen through a lottery system and increasing the number chosen by a merit based system, e verify, and more low skilled visas for agriculture and other workers. for the gop, the biggest issue by far is border security. therefore, if the democrats provided additional border security funding whether the 25 billion discussed in the previous deal or the 5. 7 billion in this potential deal , they would weaken their negotiating hand in future deals considerably obviously it wouldn't be weakened as much if they gave up 5 billion instead of 25 . if they did this, they would also take away grassroots pressure on the gop from gop constituents to get a future robust immigration deal containing robust border security. therefore, the likely hood of comprehensive immigration reform and reform that contains the democrats biggest ask, a pathway to lpr for all of the illegal immigrants that have not committed major crimes currently in the us would be almost impossible to achieve. because of this, i think that daca for border security funding is negative in relation to future negotiation of immigration bills. ultimately, it comes down to how much a person values an immediate daca fix vs how much they are aware of and care about the context of future immigration negotiations. i think it would be a major political and policy error by the democrats should they accept this trade. in politics, usually their are two choices, bad and worse, this immigration fight is a prime example of that fact for immigration reform advocates.","i think the biggest issue is that trump is using this as a political tool to divide and conquer the democratic party. the democrats are not going to budge on funding for the wall because they have all of the leverage in this fight. they are going to do so because trump is trying to use this tactic to divide the party and make it look like they are giving in to his demands, which is exactly what he is doing."
,,"the democrats have the leverage in this because they are the ones in charge of the gop. they have the power to pass immigration reform, but they aren't going to do it unless they get the wall funding. the democrats don't have the political leverage because they can't do it without the support of the republican party, and they don't want to do that."
,,"i'm not sure what you're looking for, but i think you're missing a few things. first of all, the wall isn't going to be built. it's not going to happen. second, i don't think the democrats are going to budge on funding for the wall because they don't want to give in to trump's demands. third, even if they did budge, there's no guarantee that they'd be able to stop him from building"
,,"i'm not sure what you mean by 'all of the political leverage.'the democrats have a lot of political leverage right now, but they don't have any leverage over the gop. they have no leverage over trump, and they aren't going to budge until they have more leverage over him."

t3_axadhp," Andrew Yang’s opinion on the “Freedom Dividend”/UBI and Inflation : i would like to preface that this is not a policy i ve typically supported, and it is also not one i completely believe. andrew yang is campaigning on a 1,000 per month universal basic income. the most common critique of this is that such a policy would drive up inflation. in fact, this seems like common sense: increasing the money supply at all has led to inflation several times in history. this idea, too, was my reaction as well. andrew yang addresses this in an article reported by freakonomics which, i must add, is something you should read fully. it s a quite fascinating perspective, even if you are to disagree . gt; dubner: one easy argument against a u. b. i. is that if you give everyone a dividend like you re proposing, 1,000 a month per person, all that new money in the economy will cause the kind of inflation that will render that 1,000 much less powerful. what s your argument against that? gt; yang: yeah, so i looked into the causes of inflation that are making americans miserable right now, and they are not in consumer goods like media or clothing or electronics. gt; dubner: those are all still getting much cheaper. gt; yang: yeah, and a lot of that is being made more efficient by technology and supply chains and everything else. the three things that are making americans miserable in terms of inflation are housing, education, and health care. and each of those is being driven by something other than purchasing power. housing is being driven by the fact in some markets people feel like they need to live in let s say new york or seattle or san francisco to be able to access certain opportunities and then there s not much flexibility in terms of their ability to commute like a long distance. education, it s because college has very sadly gotten two and a half times more expensive even though it has not gotten two and a half times better. and then the third is health care, which is dysfunctional because of a broken set of incentives and the fact that individuals aren t really paying in a marketplace. so if you put 1,000 into the hands of americans, it s actually going to help them manage those expenses much better. but it s not going to cause prices to skyrocket, because you can t have every vendor colluding with every other vendor to raise prices. and there s still going to be price sensitivity among every consumer and competition between firms. his ideas and rhetoric do make sense. what are the main arguments that possibly disprove it?","the problem with a 1,000 basic income is that it would be very difficult to disincentivize people from working. it would almost certainly lead to a decrease in the labor force, which would lead to an increase in unemployment. the problem with this is that people would be forced to work longer hours to make ends meet."

t3_bybj8m," World Peace can only be achieved if every country has access to nuclear weapons. : 'big stick diplomacy' where some countries extort what they want out of other countries because of their inability to meaningfully fight back is an unsustainable dynamic. sustainable diplomacy is only possible between two equally armed parties. every real world example of a better armed group conducting so called diplomacy with a worse armed group has been 100 exploitative. native americans, aboriginals, palestinians, yemenis et. al. when the weaker groups are exploited they eventually reach a point where they have no choice but to fight back ineffectually, thereby justifying their destruction by the better armed groups because they have 'resorted to violence'. an analogy in the social world would be the school bully who harasses you everyday, which falls within what is considered 'normal' social behavior and doesnt technically break any rules, but when you punch him in the face you get jail or detention or whatever. you were supposed to respect the status quo that he is stronger than you, and will always be stronger than you, and just take the harassment. that isnt sustainable on an individual scale, and it isnt sustainable on a geopolitical scale. something has to give, and exploitation leads inevitably to war. we will never be free of war while some countries are not allowed to arm themselves equally. obviously nuclear weapons are abhorrent, and if i could, i would erase them all from existence. sadly that is not possible, and the knowledge of their existence can never be erased from human memory even if they were all destroyed. we have to accept that the weapon exists and allow all our equal partners access to it, or else they are not partners but our slaves, and slaves will always always always revolt.","i don't think you understand the nature of diplomacy. diplomacy is not a negotiation, it is a negotiation between two equally armed parties. the only difference is that the two sides are negotiating with each other. the idea of diplomacy is to work together to achieve a common goal, not to work against each other in order to get what you want. it is not about getting what the other side wants, it's about trying to find a way to make the other person"

t3_cpvw1n," Asking about someone's weight on online dating apps is not the same as asking about someone's height : for a while on r tinder, there was a big trend of asking girls in response to the girl asking about the guys' height. for the sake of this conversation, i will be mostly referring to tinder as an example of 'online dating,' but this practice can be found all over reddit. the conversations are usually pretty straightforward and for most part, the same. the girl either asks how tall the guy is or states that she only dates guys a certain height. in response, the guy asks how much she weighs, asks about her bra size, or shits on her looks in some way. the girl replies, clearly upset, the guy screenshots and posts to r tinder, and rolls in the karma. examples: 1 time id been asked for my height figured id , 2 one is for my short bois out there , 3 101 , 4 dont think she was too pleased with me , 5, 6 feels so good as a man to do this to a girl a lot of people justify this trend by saying 'oh it's a double standard. ' and i would say that it's a double standard kind of. like, on paper, it's simply two people asking about something that they have a preference for. but realistically, it's two people asking about preferences that have different degrees of appropriateness relevancy. 'how big are your tits? ' is not an appropriate response to 'how tall are you? ' another difference is that you can tell someone's size based on their pictures generally unless they're cat fishing, obviously . but you can't tell how tall someone is in pictures. unless they're standing next to something that gives a really clear indicator of height, selfies and stand alone pics do not indicate height. most of the time, a persons' weight has so little to do with how they look. 3 girls could be exactly the same weight and have vastly different body types. maybe she's 130 and 5'6 but curvy, or 6 ft and super lean. hell, maybe she's 180 but ripped as fuck. or maybe she's 180 and chubby realistically, the numbers on the scale have little to do with the physicality of the person, and generally, you can tell someone's weight by their pictures. that being said people are only asking because they are seeking to hurt and belittle these women. no one or very few people, at least have a 'weight preference. ' like come on say your type is curvy chicks, and a girl with an hour glass figure, huge tits, and a perky ass comes on to you, but says she's 150 lbs are you turning her away based on that number alone? hell no, because her body type reflects your preference for bodies. or if your type is skinny girls, but a girl is 5'11 but 140 lbs. are you going based on the number on the scale, or based on what she looks like? the real equivalent to 'how tall are you' would be like 'what's your shoe size' or something else equally indiscernible based on pictures alone . not 'how much do you weigh. ' but because we all know that, for many women, weight is a sensitive subject, that's what people go for, especially because the question comes with a 'you're fat' implication. another argument i see popping up is that height is something that many men are conditioned to feel insecure about. but women have that same issue with tons of things, including height there is very much such a thing as 'too tall' at 5'9, i would know. while it sucks that there are girls who won't spring for you because of your height, shitting on the girl and then posting about in online so that thousands of random people can also bag on her. people have preferences, and people are shallow and these things are exacerbated on tinder. it's just the nature of the app. the craziest one to me is a girl putting her heigh preference in her bio, the guy swiping even though he's not that tall, and then chewing her out for it. someone please make that make sense lol. if a guy put in his bio 'i love sporty girls, watching football, and drinking beer,' well i'd swipe left, because i'm not his type. what kind of asshole would i be for swiping right, berating him for his preferences, and then posting the convo online, just because i'm not his type? a huge one, that's what. additionally, some food for thought, 75 of women n the us suffer from disordered eating is some form. i know that personally, if i, and many others, were on the receiving end of this question, it would be kind of devastating. so before throwing around a topic that is so sensitive and could have actual, adverse effects on the person, it's so much better to just learn how to handle rejection like everyone else. i mean shit, you have to tag a post if you discuss weight on many ed subs to avoid triggering people depending on the person, therapists won't even ask you about your weight if you're in recovery and the topic is a known trigger for you. for this reasons, and the reasons listed above, i would say that asking about weight is not the same as asking about height, and it is not about 'weight preferences. ' it is about belittling the woman to make oneself feel better.","i think it's a double standard in the sense that the girl is asking about the guy's height and the guy is asking the girl about her weight. it's not double standards, it's just two people asking about something that they have different degrees of appropriateness relevancy."

,,"i would argue that the ability to aim accurately and consistently is more important than the accuracy of the shot itself. you have to be able to focus on the target and aim accurately to get the shot to hit the target, and that takes a lot of practice. you also have to learn how to aim at the target accurately. if you can't do that, then you probably shouldn't be shooting at all."

,,"i don't see how modern archery can be considered inferior. modern archers have the ability to aim and aim accurately. this is a huge advantage over traditional archers, who don't have the technology to aim accurately and reliably. there is also the fact that modern bows are much easier to use, and can be used in a variety of ways."
t3_cysnxm," A simple mandate for business to spend an equal amount of money on salaries to men and women will end gender pay gap. : there is a gap in the earnings of men compared to women source i am not here to discuss the extent of it, whether it is fair or not, or the reasons that might describe it for reasons of non discrimination. those are separate and legitimate discussions. my claim is simple: if the government passes a law that businesses should spend an equal amount of money per person on salaries to men and women, then the earnings gap will go away without any long term damage to the economy. if a company fails to comply to this standard, they will be fined by the amount of money necessary to bring that average to equal for that company, plus an extra fee. the tax money will be paid in terms of compensation to the workers of the gender which is paid below the average. this ensures that the company itself is incentivized to pay equally to all genders. this would not be implemented in one go, so there wouldn't be a freakout day where suddenly cleaners are paid at the same rate as doctors. there will be a transition period of multiple years , during which businesses can adjust their hiring and training practices. some challenges that i've given to myself, and my own responses: what if a company has 10 male lawyers and 10 female cleaners? this only demonstrates that the hiring practices of the company has not been gender inclusive enough. during the transition period, they will be able to hire female lawyers and male cleaners and pay them the appropriate rate so that they wouldn't be fined. what about very small businesses? if they have two employees this doesn't work! correct. there should be a minimum number of employees before this regulation kicks in. there are many employment regulations in the us which only applies to businesses larger than a certain number of people. what about businesses where employees of a certain gender are preferred? imagine strip clubs, barbers or beauty salons if a business believes discrimination on this factor serves a real business purpose, then they should apply for an exemption and the regulation needs to be reasonable with those requests. what if there is a shortage of a certain gender among a profession? say females in tech? the regulation does not say the sum of all salaries paid to men and women at a business must be the same, but only that on average, they should be. so google can have 1000 male and 200 female software engineers, as long as those are paid, on average, the same rate, they are good. what about people who do not identify as male or female? nothing in the regulation makes gender a dichotomy. there can be more than two genders and a similar principle applies.","the problem with gender equality is that it doesn't work. it seems like you are trying to get businesses to pay everyone the same, but that's not the way it works. it's not fair to people who don't want to be paid the same as someone who does, because it's unfair to the people who are being paid more than they should be."

t3_bbdd9p," All the online accounts should be reconducible to one real person. How? Re-thinking our email address system. : this is my first post here, i hope that this idea has not yet been discussed and that the discussion will be interesting. preamble: one of the biggest problems of internet is related to the easiness of the anonymity, that allow people to express their selves too freely and lead them to be very unrespectful of the others. i don't want to dive into all the illegal stuff that happens on the dark web, i am talking about big platforms these aspect will come later . these, ultimately, are the ones that are really important and that can lead to big consequences into real life, even for those people who don't use internet a lot for instance influencing the news media . moreover, the increasing amount of fake accounts controlled and created by bots is a huge problem in social networks like twitter or youtube this is a nice video explaining the bot problem they are spending a lot of energy to fight them instead of employing that resources to something else! these fake accounts are really difficult to spot and to delete, and are aimed to share polarizing opinions that divide the population and lead to a polluted environment, preventing nice discussions, spreading fake news and so on so, how could we face this problem? we are used to think about the internet as something that is not so important and that is mostly disconnected with our daily life; but the time that we spend on social networks has, of course, real consequences in our lives and its importance is undeniable. so why don't we link our social identities to our real ones? how can we do this and why are we scared of doing so? this of course would not prevent us to share fake news and to pollute the discussion with harassments but at least will block the existence of fake accounts that, as you may now, are a huge problem nowadays. i will share with you my idea on how i would to this; i will also briefly mention some critics to this argument and what's my opinion about those. so, first things first, how could we link our accounts to our person? well, we could stop using email addresses of private companies and use, for each country, a different email provider offered by the public administrations, that can be obtained going into a public office like when we have to renew our id cars. this may take a long time, of course, but imagine that we, as a society, will be able to do this in all the world. what would come next? public administrations could set up laws that force all the internet sites to accept email addresses coming only from the above mentioned public provider. doing so, for each site you could have one and only one account, directly related to you. you cannot have more than one simply because one email relates to only one account and you cannot obviously have more than one email in this way. i think that the difficult part of this process would be the first step. then, adding a new rule that the companies must follow would not be so troublesome, they already have to respect a lot of rules that are constantly changing. one critique is that, of course, some little platforms would be able to escape to these rules or could give the opportunity of share contents without an account; but they won't never be gigantic platforms with a real influence on the public opinion like twitter or facebook! these last ones could not break such a law! i mean, of course they could break some laws as they are doing right now in some occasions, but the account generation system could be controlled more deeply if the system is applied and as soon as a platform is big enough for sure it will be controlled. another critique could be something like: 'anonymity is important! then everyone will know what i am doing'. this aspect is very important to me, and i think that the situation will be really similar to the one that we are living today. nicknames won't cease to exist and the real identity of the account will be known only from the platform provider, as today, if the email is set to 'private'. as long as people do legal things, no one will have the power to see who is behind one account. so, this will simply reduce the willingness of people to share illegal contents and to do public harassment. what do you think about this? change my view on the fact that we should be able to find a direct link to the online account to the real person behind it and prevent people to do more than one account for each site! and if you think is right to do so, how would you implement it? i know my strategy can seem expensive, but i haven't come up with something cheaper.","the problem with this is that it's not really a strategy, it's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. you can't just link your social identities to your real ones and then expect everyone to use a different one. it's impossible to do that, because it would be a massive waste of time and resources. if you link your real name to your email address, you're going to have to create a new email address for each country, and that's"

t3_aby8lo," the primary reason Asians fare poorly in the dating market is because of the size of their genitals. Alternative explanations are either minor or ways to avoid confronting the offensive reality : anyone who watches porn will notice the significantly smaller sizes of asian penises when compared to whites and blacks. i am not trying to disparage asian males; i am merely pointing out reasons that explain the troubles asians face in the dating game. because they are smaller than average, they aren't able to provide the same level of penetrative pleasure during sex relative to other races. this places them at a disadvantage since sexual pleasure is what influences the stability of relationships and the willingness to commit to a relationship especially since relationships are a huge investment in time and energy. the whole point of sex is pleasure and although there are many ways of providing pleasure, they don't compare with penetrative pleasure. if asian males had big penises i think they would be near the top of the dating chain. what can be done about this is scientific breakthroughs that allow for penis enhancement. changing societal perceptions of males isn't going to change the underlying problem.","i think the problem is not that asian males are smaller than other races, it's that they are less likely to be able to provide the same level of penetrative pleasure as other races. asian men generally have smaller penises than white and black men, which is why they are more likely to have larger penises. i don't think it's fair to say that asians are at an advantage in the dating game because they are smaller, but i think it"

t3_crjqmk," Disagreement about mainstream politics should never cause families to collapse, or friendships to end. : examples of this are across the media, such as this writer n 5c17d7bce4b030ed3ed001d0 who hasn't spoken to her entire extended family for two years because her parents campaigned for trump. personally, i know of a friendship which ended because one party transitioned their gender and the other simply couldn't tolerate it. i think most of us have experience of the tension politics can create, and unfortunately it seems to be getting worse and worse. i understand that sometimes a political argument can be the final straw in a relationship which, prior to that argument, has been struggling and tense for a long time. in those situations i don't regard the political disagreement as the cause of the breakdown, but rather a catalyst or tipping point. i'm referring solely to relationships which prior to the discovery of the political tension are strong and reliable. the father who kicks his daughter out because she attended gay pride, and the son who won't see his mother at christmas since he learnt she votes trump. i don't think this behaviour is ever justifiable. it takes someone so committed to their dogma, so brazenly blind to alternative viewpoints, so insolent to any ideas except their own, to happily tear down a beautiful and important human relationship for the sake of minor principle. i think part of the problem is due to the increasing perception that people on the other side of the coin are malicious, or in some way corrupt; people hear differing opinions and assert a character judgement, rather than understanding the reasoning behind it which almost always exists . i know one of the first questions will be what, exactly, 'mainstream' politics is. for the sake of simplicity, let's call democratic and republican party policy 'mainstream'. obviously this definition will change on your location and personal perception, but the spirit of the distinction is clear: unless your friend is saying the government should lynch every ginger person in the country, you shouldn't cut them off and block their social media because of a political view. 99. 99 of us excluding the aforementioned ginger lynchmob have a huge amount more in common than divides us. in the case of families and longterm friendships, this commonality is only accentuated. we shouldn't allow this trend to continue, and check it when it arises in ourselves.","i don't think it's fair to say that political disagreements are the root cause of a relationship breakdown, but rather that they are the result of a lack of respect for the other person's opinions and beliefs. i'm not saying that you shouldn't respect the opinions of your friends, but that you should respect the beliefs of the people around you."

t3_bkwi8e," It's tough to get help/advice​ on Reddit when you are not part of the majority : first, i'm going to start by giving you my background and a few examples so that you can understand where i'm coming from. i was born in portugal, and at the moment i'm living in the uk. i'm also a very solitary person, meaning that sometimes i try to get advices from other people through reddit. however, more and more, i feel that is pointless to ask for help through reddit. let's face it most people here are americans, and this means that you will get advice that applies to someone in the usa. this is not me being against usa in any way i'm sure if you asked for help in the uk, you would get advice that applies to someone that grew up in the british culture. it's completely normal. but it gets very frustrating, particularly when i make the effort of saying, in the first place, that i'm not american but the advice that i get completely ignores that fact. i'm going to give you two examples. i'm going to get a puppy in a few months. i was looking for guides on how to raise puppies and so went to r dogs to ask for help. people immediately started talking about crating. i grew up with dogs and i never knew this was a common practice, so i made some research on the matter. apparently, crating is a big thing in the us, but only in the us. in fact, in some european countries, crating is considered animal abuse if it's done on a daily basis to keep the dog from having access to the rest of the house. okay, so, fair enough. so, i mentioned this that i was not that keen on crating and i would prefer advice that didn't rely on it and got immediately downvoted. the only comment that i got you need to do crating. sigh. there was even on person that said she kept her two rough collies average to large dogs 8 hours a day on crates. this would be a crime in some european countries and that's where i live. moving on, this isn't a post about crating. other example. i was in a subreddit about relationships. someone mentioned people using suicide as a way to manipulate a person in staying in the relationship. that happened to me in the past. i told these people my experience i tried to break up with someone, they said that they were going to kill themselves. i called the police, said that i was worried about the person particularly because this person had tried to kill herself in the past , and they went to check her out. everything turned out okay. as soon as i tell this story, some people started saying 'you shouldn't have done that, police in the past have actually killed people in situations like this'. right, well, these people ignored completely the fact that most police in the uk doesn't even carry a firearm. they also ignored the fact that most people in the uk simple aren't going to kill themselves with a gun, so the police isn't even afraid to check them out. of course, i'm not saying that americans are at fault here. they are just relying on their own experience, as every human being does. but this also means that i have to shape my questions in a way that either doesn't insult the typical american experience i. e. crating as an example or, in more neutral questions, i need to highlight exactly what is the situation that i'm living i. e. there aren't guns around me, national health care is a thing, etc . of course, because i'm not american, this means that i need to make 3 4 posts before i get everything right. before that, i either get downvoted or the help advice given doesn't apply to my situation. usually, i just avoid asking for help altogether because it's either too frustrating or too time consuming. even when i try to explain the context, i usually get downvoted before i get any help usually because i trigger someone on issues that they care about crating as an example . so, reddit, cmv should i stop asking for help?","i think you're looking at it the wrong way. i'm not saying that you're wrong, i'm just saying that it's not your place to judge other people based on your own personal experiences. that's not to say that the advice you're getting from other people isn't valid, but it is not the same as judging others based on their own experiences. i don't think it's fair to judge someone based on the experiences they've had, but i do think that it is fair to"

t3_a2tkzi," contrary to popular historical sentiment, George McClellan was a good general : mcclellan is often criticized and called incompetent, but under scrutiny this position falls apart. when you compare him to other union generals in the eastern theater he is satisfactory or even above average. west virginia: mcclellan defeats the confederacy in a number of battles and becomes a national war hero. this speaks for itself so i won't expand on it building the army of the potomac: mcclellan converts a ragtag gang into a truly organized and disciplined army. this is an impressive feat which other union generals benefited and relied upon after mcclellan's departure. his soldiers loved him and regarded him with respect and affection. peninsula campaign: mcclellan loses this campaign, however there are several things we need to keep in mind. he was up against the largest confederate army ever assembled yet he still did fine in contrast to other eastern union campaigns at the time first and second bull run his campaign did not end in disaster or rout. in fact he achieved a number of tactical victories. he held his ground against the confederates and resisted them stiffly, only being 'defeated' because lincoln meddled in his affairs and forced him to withdraw. he reached the same point grant reached in his 1864 overland campaign, however he did so with 30,000 less casualties mcclellan came within a few miles of richmond and panicked the confederate government. even after his withdrawal, his advances in the peninsula campaign had robert e lee looking over his shoulder and watching his back for the remainder of the war. in what ultimately turned out to be a war of attrition, mcclellan achieved an outstanding casualty ratio 23,000 union casualties vs 29,000 confederate casualties in the eastern theater where confederates generally inflicted more casualties than they received first and second bull run, fredericksburg, overland campaign, petersburg campaign antietam: mcclellan is often criticized because had intelligence on confederate positions and missed a chance to destroy the retreating confederate army. these are valid criticisms and he did underperform slightly in this battle. however we need to look at the overall outcome and the big picture. historians are extremely critical of mcclellan for antietam but they get so caught up in criticism that they forget that he did in fact win this battle . it was a large, decisive, strategic victory. he defeated the confederates and turned robert e lee back. even if he could have won harder, he did still win. amp;nbsp; mcclellan was not a prodigy or a genius but he was a good general. although he did not always achieve glorious results, he never had humiliating failures either. after pope took command of operations in virginia, he was soundly beaten at second bull run. and after mcclellan was relieved, his successors were decisively whipped at fredericksburg and chancellorsville. these would have never happened under mcclellan, who always did well especially considering he was up against one of the best armies and some of the most brilliant commanders ever assembled.","i don't think mcclellan is a respectable and respectable general. he was a good general, but he was also a terrible one. he didn't have the discipline or discipline to deal with a large army. he did a terrible job of building up the army of the potomac, but it was a ragtag force. he had a lot of poor generals, and the army was poorly equipped. he lost the peninsula campaign because he was unable to coordinate his"

' except doing so would be tantamount to deception, as you are denying that person your hopefully thought out opinion. this might lead them to believe that their ideas are king among others when they just might not be. you are also potentially allowing them to continue having opinions that are not well thought out or researched. for example, let's say someone brings up a controversial issue. let's say that issue has to do with immigration, or gun control, or any other politically charged topic. the person bringing up the issue s is someone who is obviously uneducated on most of the topic he speaks of. if you are someone who is knowledgeable in the topic, would it not be detrimental to this figurative person to withhold the facts in relation to the topic? damaging to him, even? would it not be more beneficial for this figurative person to hear what you have to say, and thus go into future political discussions with accurate information and a more informed perspective? of course there are people out there who are firmly stuck in their stubborn ways and won't change them regardless of who says what, but again, i'm not talking about those people. tldr: honesty and argument is more useful in the long run than being polite while discussing controversial topics with the people around you. if someone is uneducated on an issue, it would be detrimental to them if you were to withhold the truth from them, furthering their idea that their opinion is without fault.","i think you're missing the point of being polite when it comes to controversial topics. being polite is about being able to express your opinion in a way that doesn't alienate the other person. it's not about being a jerk, it's about being polite to listen to what they have to say. if you don't want to be polite, then don't be polite."

t3_beaji9," If you are in the media industry, and you wear revealing clothes/naked, it is NOT empowerment. : hi there. ever since i saw this tweet from ariana grande i have been thinking and thinking because the minute i read this, something urked me but i couldn't tell what it was. on one hand, i strongly believe women should be allowed to wear revealing clothes in the same way men are allowed to wear polo shirts and t shirts because of their comfort. but unfortunately i just couldn't seem to agree with this tweet and this general consensus that women in the media industry who are naked revealing clothes calling it empowerment. if they didn't call it empowerment, i would just assume it is comfort but when a woman like ariana grande says it is empowerment, i couldn't seem to agree. after thinking for a long time, i have finally come to the strong conclusion that if you are in the media industry, and you wear revealing clothes naked, it is not empowerment. wearing revealing clothes in a media industry where there are sick perverts who love women wearing revealing clothes naked e. g the fappening even though their intention isn't too come off as promiscuous but just comfortable oozes of confidence. but in no way should that be confused with empowerment. the reason being, empowerment solely comes down to the audience, not to the person like ariana pundai who claims it is empowerment. if the audience of twitch streamer who's audience members are young people who want to see nudity and cleavage, the twitch streamer can't turn around and call it 'empowerment' because you are not destigmatises anything but rather giving exactly what people want a. k. a nudity. she can say she is confident in what she is wearing but the empowerment aspect comes down to the audience's point of view. in ariana and other people who have the same views as her's case, i strongly disagree with them calling it empowerment because let's face it, sex sells point and case being fifty shades trilogy with each of them earning more than a quentin tarantino movies, aside from django unchained and the obvious anaconda by nicki minhaj and when you are making songs about how much you want to get banged because you are drunk and walking side to side or any other sex related songs, you are guaranteed to make a lot of views and money because of its topic appeal and this appeal, doesn't come from and isn't about passion or anything but audience wanting to seeing nudity revealing clothes while making sexual gestures. in other words, you are being confident thinking it's empowerment but for the audience you are just giving them what they want of that similar to the twitch streamer. there is nothing empowering. you are just moving up the ranks and making money while taking the easy way and essiently manipulate the capitalist system in your favor. just narcissistic and manipulative. if ariana or other celebrities who wear revealing clothes say it is because they are comfortable it is a beyond rational answer but to say it is empowerment is only empowerment for people's genitalia. i'm sorry if this post has offended someone and i do not mean anything in a hurtful manner. feel free to leave comments. i know the belief i have is very cynical and something most people reading this won't have. i am really interested as to what you think and getting my mind changed. thank you and have a nice day",i don't think there's a difference between empowerment and empowerment. i think it depends on what you mean by empowerment. ariana grande is using the word 'empowerment' as a euphemism for being sexually promiscuous. i don't see how it can be defined as empowerment.

t3_akju9n,"Women are not less visual : very often, you will hear one internet forums and threads this notion that women are less visual than men and they care more about a mans character personality. you'll hear it from women and men in real life. girls will say they loved their man because of who he was blah blah blah. i personally think it's bullshit. women care about looks just as much as men do. the only difference is that they emphasize different traits. however, the traits they emphasize like height are immutable and so it even makes things harder for men to be attractive. women can always wear makeup or have plastic surgery to enhance their looks wheras men can't do anything. they just don't care about facial attractiveness or physique as much as men do but they emphasize height a lot. women are not less visual or less superficial. women emphasize height a lot. you might not think it's that important if you're an average height or tall guy but that's because you don't know what it's like for shorter men in dating. google the 'height and dating' video on youtube. i can't link it here. it's a dating experiment where they line up men of different heights who have different talents occupations and women choose from them. the men stand next to each other and the women are given a description of each men. the descriptions are purposely manipulated such that the shorter guys have better occupations and more talents. look at the video, the women pick the tall guys over the shorts guy regardless of circumstances. meaning it doesn't matter if they are rich, caring, successful, talented. they rule him out over a stupid physical trait. at one point there is a guy named dave. he's 5'6 and handsome, women still prefer an average looking tall guy who is a gym teacher. even when they make dave a chief surgeon, some of the women still prefer the taller guy. they literally have to make him god so women find him more attractive. he has to be godlike talented, author, surgeon, chef, etc. just to be more appealing than an average looking gym teacher. then all i hear is this bullshit about how women are less visual and they don't care. bullshit. they care just as much, if not more. women look for personality too but it means hardly anything if you're not tall enough. 5'6 isn't even that short but women will pick a mediocre 6 ft guy over you. but no, women are less visual. they care so much about personality. give me a fucking break. i'm not saying you can't get a partner as a short guy. you can but boy, you have to do everything else perfectly just for a mediocre girl. what i'm saying is that women are not any less visual or shallow than men when it comes to dating. they will rule out a man regardless of how special he is just over the length of his legs. one could argue it's even more shallow than what men do because it's not something that can be changed. please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.","i think you're misinterpreting the definition of the word 'attractiveness' here. it's not that women are less visual, it's that they don't care as much about personality as men do. i don't think it's true that women care less about personality than men, but i do think it is true that they are less likely to be attracted to someone with a personality that is similar to their own. for example, i know plenty of women"

'oh you're so beautiful you're the most beautiful women in the world' he says to a 5 10 average girl when he himself knows it's an outright lie he's telling her. and she might go on about how he's so strong willed or something when in reality he's just as weak as anyone else. love makes you lie? how is that a positive feeling towards one another. all's fair in love and war? fitting quote since love is essentially a war. war is also cringe since it's people dying and not learning from the countless other wars that maybe there's another way to solve problems, and that is pretty cringe in my book. why would you kill yourself over love? it's a really bad idea yet people still do it just like they did in war. it's people not learning, and that's pretty cringe. society teaches us that 'if you don't have love you're worthless, and that's a cringe potion to hold. i don't have love and i could sell myself to someone on craigslist right now. being horny makes you dumb, like really dumb. you do things you'd never do when you weren't horny. well, love is being horny with your heart. imagine that, being horny with your heart. but contrary to jacking off, there's no moment of realizing what you did was gross, no post nut clarity if you're in love. it's like being horny all the time and never able to have a love orgasm to make you realize 'oh wait i was a huge idiot back there, woah maybe i should stop what i'm doing right now.

t3_c3mevx," Unless you are very tech savvy or have limited finances, you should always choose a mac over a PC : now to clarify the two exceptions: if you are yourself a programer, work in it or someone who has an advanced knowledge of computers then a pc would be the way to go. similarly if you are someone who needs a computer, and you simply cannot afford to spend extra on a mac, then a pc is better than nothing. these are the two exceptions, for all normal, everyday users, i think a mac is always the best choice. even if it's more expensive, you are well worth paying extra. i'm typing this right now from a newish pc laptop dell xps 15 after making the switch from macs for the last few years. what made me make the switch was that i was sick of dongles, i do a bit of video ing audio engineering photoshop in my work, and i decided it would be better to pay half the price for a machine that is just as powerful, if not moreso than a macbook pro. and after making the jump i remembered why i switched to mac all those years ago. pcs are not good. windows is not good. if you are a normal user if you're into coding sure, there is so much more you can do on your pc than a mac i'm sure. but here are two examples: by the way i am not looking for tech support here, these issues are unfixable and this is not what this post is about. these two issues are just representative examples of the kinds of issues that plague pcs my screen keeps automatically dimming. annoying. and i don't know how to fix it. on a mac you can go to your display settings, but on this machine i have 4 different display settings. the dell settings, the windows settings, the control panel settings, and the intel settings. it isn't intuative. just to change a simple setting, i have had to read pages and pages of forums of people who have the same complaint, trying to find a 'workaround'. in the end, after literally 6 hours of forums and searching and trying to find a fix, i just gave up. the screen still dims. i also tried to run an older game. a four year old game that should run fine on my laptop at ultra settings according to all specs. but it would only let me run it at the lowest possible settings. why? who knows. again, reading pages and pages of forums to find a solution, lots of people complaining about similar problems with all kinds of games. eventually i found that it wasn't recognizing my graphics card, after downloading new drivers and changing the graphics card settings, nothing. then i found a 'workaround'by going into a game text file and literally adding new lines of code. i am not a programmer i just copy pasted stuff from a forum. the fix worked, now i can play the game for an hour at a time before it crashes. with both of these problems there is nowhere i can go. there is no genius bar, no tech support available, and too many variables for anyone to pin down exactly what is wrong. and i'm not a programmer, i'm not tech savvy. i just want a machine that does what i want it to do. macs just work. they really do. and if you have an issue, you just go to the apple store, and they fix it. these two problems are just examples. back when i used pcs all the time it was the same story. for some reason this one game won't work. or this video file won't play. or the driver for my sound card wouldn't boot up, or this piece of software would freeze unless i changed this line of code in some file that i really shouldn't be messing with. if you are tech savvy and like programming things and like tinkering with computers then sure a pc is the way to go. but if you just want to use your computer without having to spend hours researching workarounds for basic problems that will crop up every day, then you should always spend the extra money on a mac. it's well worth it. and side note, if you say that the problems are caused by my own lack of knowledge, then yes, you're probably right. which is why you should always choose a mac. because you can just use it without having to take an it course. cmv","it depends on what you're doing with your computer. if you're using a pc as your primary computer, then a mac is better than a pc. a pc is better for a number of reasons. it's easier to use, it's cheaper, and it's more powerful."

t3_czzu16," We need to stop arguing about whether abortion is moral and/or should be legal in the US. : 1. if you believe abortion murder, don t have one. 2. most anti choice people don t believe that all women who have abortions should be charged with murder and put in prison which means on some level they admit it should be legal. can you imagine a scenario where you could hire someone to kill your kid and you weren t charged, only the hit man was? no? because the law still recognizes murder for hire 3. most anti choice want exceptions for rape or incest which means on some level they admit it s not murder. can you imagine a scenario where a woman is raped by a family friend and a few weeks after she kills his 2 year old kid without charges? no? because intentional murder has no exceptions 4. most anti choice have notions about choosing to have sex and thereby choosing to be pregnant which equates to consequences. if they re only actual objection to abortion is about choice and consequences then they d increase access to birth control and sex education programs which have both been proven to statistically decrease abortions. could you imagine requiring a married woman to have as many kids as she can? no? because we don t live in the 1800 s anymore where the average was 7 8 kids per family and even married people now control their number of children through birth control. 5. most anti choice want women to carry unwanted, unplanned fetuses to term because it s a human life that has value. could you imagine attributing that same zeal to the value of actual children? no? because we don t! that s the problem, which is the most anti life thing of all. if they actually care about life, then they d do something about all the death and despair happening to the american children already born. instead of abortion we should be arguing about the morality of children living in poverty levels not able to meet their basic needs, homeless children, the growing number of kids in foster care and the soaring infant mortality rates. we should be arguing about how to expand access to birth control. there are 72. 4 million children under age 18 years in the united states. 41 percent of those children live in low income families. above low income is defined as at or above 200 of the federal poverty threshold fpt . research suggests that, on average, families need an income equal to about two times the federal poverty threshold to meet their most basic needs. children in poverty 1194. html a staggering 2. 5 million children are now homeless each year in america. this historic high represents one in every 30 children in the united states. homeless children on any given day, there are nearly 443,000 children in foster care in the united states. in 2017, more than 690,000 children spent time in u. s. foster care. children in foster care more than 23,000 american infants died in 2014, or about 6 for every 1,000 live births, putting us on par with countries like serbia and malaysia. most other developed countries as geographically diverse as japan, finland, australia and israel have lower rates, closer to 2 or 3 deaths out of every 1,000. premature births are the biggest factor in explaining the united states' high infant mortality rate. the major issue of the lack of universal access to quality prenatal care should also be considered in any discussion of preterm births and infant mortality. perhaps not surprisingly, babies born to wealthier and better educated parents in the united states tended to fare about as well as infants born in european countries. on the other hand, those babies born to mothers in the united states without these advantages were more likely to die than any other group, even similarly disadvantaged populations in the other countries. infant mortality a new report from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc shows that abortion rates are down across the board and suggests that people are able to more effectively plan their reproductive futures. yet, the trump administration has finalized a regressive set of health insurance policy changes that could roll back access to the very thing that has helped us get here: birth control. birth control tldr: anti choice don t actually want abortion to be illegal because they have rape incest exceptions and don t want to imprison women who ve had an abortion. arguing the morality of abortions is unproductive and not helpful in achieving the goal of valuing life or decreasing abortions. instead we should be arguing about the morality of millions of children in poverty or homelessness and limited access to birth control. so change my view and tell me why it s productive or beneficial to continuing to discuss the morality and legality of abortions in america.","i'm pro choice, but i'm not pro choice. i don't believe abortion should be legal. i believe it should be illegal because it's a violation of a woman's bodily autonomy. if a woman chooses to have an abortion, that's her choice and she should be responsible for her own body and her own choices. i do not believe that all women who have abortions should be charged with murder and put in prison."

t3_c8niai," Olympics, or any other sort of grand competition involving segregated nationalities just serves to amplify any sort of “isms” in today’s anxious world. : greetings good people of reddit. this is my first time posting here, so apologies in advance if something seems out of place. now onto the main point of this post. we all have seen the brief, lukewarm comeback of nationalism in recent years. the reasons are subject to another discussion, but it is evident that the sudden surge of western nationalism is a topic of great debate. historically, the olympics are structured around nations nation states, and national teams, while still attempting to promote universalism, internationalism, and the unity of humankind. still, based on my empirical observation, i firmly believe that it has a net negative impact on humanity, than positive, well besides the obvious economic benefit for the host country. now, having said this, i d like to briefly explore the role, which media plays in this endeavor. i bet we can agree, that with the increasingly ever changing world, media with all its extensions e. g. digital publications, social networks, tv, etc. will continue to exert a great impact not only on ways we watch the games, whether it s the olympics, the world cup or any other grand events of such calibre but also on social and political consciousness. newspapers, radio, television, and digital media will also produce new forms of nationalism which fit contemporary politics and various agendas. although the internet was expected to contribute to democratization in its early period, thanks to its interactive characteristics, it is now clearer that the internet has also created a more reactionary, anti democratic and anti intellectual nationalism. people are becoming increasingly interpassive and are easily falling into the traps of fake news through which they are also mobilized case of brexit, trump, and so forth . so olympics, regrettably instead of promoting the unity amongst people, will gradually become the very thing it wanted to absolve. don t get me wrong, i am not saying we should just ban the olympics or the fifa world cup right away, but if humanity is to strive towards unification, i think we should sit down and carefully think what ramifications these grand events have on the general social commentary and most importantly on the inter subjective social consciousness.","the olympics and the fifa world cup are great examples of the power of media to bring people together in a global community. they have been around for a long time, and have a long history of helping to unite people around a common goal. it's not that the world cup is inherently anti nationalism, it's that it's the culmination of millions of people coming together to cheer for a common cause. if you don't like the idea of nationalism, then you"
