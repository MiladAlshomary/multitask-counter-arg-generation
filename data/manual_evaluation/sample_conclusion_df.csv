0,t3_ax8k7o,"a few years back i would use notepad for my programming in c which was fine at the time. i then spent time using vscode to code in python. i made a huge project with hundreds of lines of python code, but it needed a couple of lines of python code and i was near a computer that did only had notepad installed and needed a quick fix. so i added the couple of lines of python code using notepad and everything looks indented like it should like in vscode, but when i tried to interpret the code with the python interpreter it gave indentation error issues. in this instance its terrible to transition from vscode to notepad to make a few additions and in this sense it is terrible to use notepad to code in python. this flaw in notepad might cause people to avoid using notepad altogether and settle with something like vscode, because people don't want to switch text ors just to code in a different language. in that sense more people may transition to vscode and leave other text ors just because how supportive vscode is. as stated before i used notepad for c so i'm not attacking a text or. notepad is more light weight than vscode, but not by a significant amount. the light theme notepad has is the only theme i like that is light. normally i would prefer dark themes like vscode's dark theme is quite nice. i really hope you can change my view that notepad isn't a terrible or to code in and that maybe i could be wrong.",Python (programming language) is terrible to code in and notepad is the only good text-to-code language.,joint-learning

21,t3_bx46xe,"if you agree that there is such a thing as hate, then you must necessarily agree that there is such a thing as hateful. hate speech: abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation. we can acknowledge hate speech without legally restricting free speech. acknowledging hate speech is not necessarily the same as advocating for or implementing laws that would restrict hate speech. i believe that those who refuse to acknowledge that hate speech exists generally do so because they fear that by acknowledging it, they're giving a foothold to laws and to a lesser extent policies by private entities to ban certain speech. raising the point 'but who decides what is hate speech? ' doesn't actually disprove the existence of hate speech. appealing to the 'free market place of ideas' doesn't disprove the existence of hate speech and doesn't even guarantee that good ideas prevail over bad ideas. good ideas being ones that have integrity and or facilitate some goal and bad ideas being ones that lack integrity and or don't facilitate some goal, or worse, is counter productive. by integrity i just mean ideas that are honest, rational, and objective . we can more or less objectively evaluate whether some speech is hateful or not. what speech should be banned, by who, where, when, why, and how is a different conversation. and if you must know, here is my position on free speech. i think it is very useful to think of free speech as generally the lesser of two evils that is free speech for all, or free speech for some or no one . that is, i think a society that has free speech is generally better than one that doesn't, but i also acknowledge that free speech has a cost itself. after all, it's ridiculous to deny that speech has no consequences for society individuals, if such were the case we would not ever desire to see the rise or decline of certain ideas. if enough people have hate for a group in society, it stands to reason that there will be increasingly adverse consequences for that group as hate for them increases though the exact details depends on their position and numbers, as well as the position and numbers of those who hate them . it should be obvious, but i think a society with less hate speech is better as well.","Sexual orientation/race should not be a component of hate speech and should not make the ""free market of ideas"" into a target..",pipeline-learning

49,t3_b536em,"the context for this discussion comes from a law that will be put into action very soon in my country of the uk: on april 1st, porn websites will require people connecting from the uk to provide some proof of identification for entry. this can be done in a number of ways, namely sending a picture of your passport driving license to the website or buying a 'porn license' from your local shop which will cost around 5 . the arguments against this enforcement are plentiful and convincing, usually involving security risks of sending highly private documents to services you cant trust, or the idea of publicly displaying your private interests by buying the license. i agree with these arguments strongly and i doubt many people see good in them, but i think the discussion should be focused on a different area: should there even be an age restriction on pornography? it is well documented and normal for young teenagers to masturbate once their sexual hormones start developing. the safest way they can do this is through the use of pornography between two consenting adults. this allows the person to stimulate themselves without directly violating the consent of anyone else, as well as giving them an environment to learn about topics such as consent and safe sex without the awkward nature of being taught this in the classroom or by your parents. say someone never had access to any pornography while growing up. how are they going to understand when another person wishes to have sex with them? will they even know if they themselves consent, and how they can express that? what happens if a teen gets so sexually frustrated he starts lashing out at his friends and family and starts exploring sex masturbation in unsafe ways as a result? a better society would technically and legally allow people of all ages to view pornographic material, however greater emphasis would have to be put on parents to make sure their child is learning about themselves safely and in their own time. i admit this is a fairly hard topic to discuss, i've spent more time trying to find the safest way to word some sentences than i have actually thinking about my point of view on this haha. feel free to argue either minimum age for watching porn being good or proof of identity to check that minimum age being good, but i think it's more likely my opinion is going to change regarding the former.","Pornography should be available to people of all ages, regardless of age.",joint-learning

' , which could very well be a moment where the movie is paused and says 'you are about to witness a character make a choice. take note, the choice this character makes is the correct one. you will be given a test on choices after the film. ' seriously, nobody in the real world talks in a remotely similar way, and it feels directed at the audience, kinda like how a fable is. whatever immersion there was, breaks at that moment. 3. logic gives way to the plot. let's take the first girl rescue scene to show what i mean. the bad guy comes in, and asks about the girl. he gets knocked out. instead of finishing the bad guy and hiding him somewhere it will take time to find him before running off asap, logan so conveniently for the plot! tells the sniffer guy to throw him by the road, while he gets xavier wouldn't it be more logical to swap the roles? logan can stand up for himself, sniffer can not . sniffer is caught just laying the bad guy on the road nuh, wouldn't be suspicious at all , when the bad guys are coming by. the bad guys decide to go get the girl, but it turns out the girl can fight and do it well, and the bad guys' henchmen are defenseless against the team of the girl and logan yes, the bad guys knew, conveniently they didn't bring any means to restrain her except for 'just dogpile and outnumber, she can't cut us all' . the henchmen don't seem to have the upper hand at all, but instead of finishing them all off because they are all obviously just cannon fodder, the good guys decide to run. conveniently for them, a train was passing by, and of course the bad guys which are, at least judging by uniforms, mexican law enforcement had no contingency plans like you know, a helicopter, or at least locking the nearest border crossings when you know you are hunting americans and they escaped. so convenient for the plot, all of this. all this combines into making the movie a mediocre one to me. to change my view you could explain why any of these points is wrong, or just show anything that is good with the movie.",Corporation is a bad movie.,joint-learning

112,t3_cvz3ha,"i'd like to preface this by saying that murder is rarely justifiable, and even more rarely is it justifiable to murder a child. timothy mcveigh is not innocent, or morally good, and i don't wish for this to precede from the false pretense that i think what he did was harmless, or morally correct. for the unfamiliar, timothy mcveigh is a domestic terrorist responsible for the oklahoma city bombing. the bombing happened april 19th, 1995, and killed 168 people, including 25 children. the target was the alfred p. murrah federal building, and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the dea, atf, social security administration, and recruiting offices for the army and marine corps. the attack was carried out in protest to the waco siege, the ruby ridge incident, and an act of retaliation against what tim saw as a tyrannical, oppressive government. that's the short and sweet of it, but there's a lot more to the story if you ever want to look into it. however, i believe that this act is inspirational in a number of ways. first and foremost, the attack was carried out almost exclusively by himself. two co conspirators helped him gather supplies, but refused to help him construct the bomb, position it, or set it off. additionally, the response to the bombing the deadliest act of terrorism in the u. s. until 9 11, and still the deadliest act of domestic terrorism brought the federal government to a screeching halt for about a day and a half. and this was all done by one man. nonviolent protest is wonderful, but sometimes it just doesn't work. if one disgruntled guy with some books, and two friends, could bring the government to a stop for a day and a half, imagine what an citizen's revolt could accomplish. this is mostly in reference to the things going on in hong kong. i completely understand the idea behind nonviolent, peaceful protest, but when it doesn't work, sometimes you might need to grab a book and some friends, and rent a truck."," Timothy McVeigh, while technically a domestic terrorist, should be an inspiration to the working class, the underpowered, and the unheard.",ground-truth

126,t3_b23zt2,"before i start, i am not writing this with a very specific issue in mind, i have always believed this. i am sick of that perfectly true, but ideologically pointless argument that while you have free speech, privately owned platforms like reddit, youtube, fb etc don't have any obligation to allow you to express yourself on their platforms. this is very insincere way to 'support free speech' and is actually just the opposite, supporting censorship. i am personally from an european country that like most european countries doesn't even have anything like the right to free speech, although ironically i have to say that due to less pc culture there is very little censorship actually happening. but as a liberal, i have strong respect for the us 1st amendment, and since i agree ideologically, i naturally also believe that the principle should be upheld in private institutions and platforms as well. first, all big platforms used for communication and exchange of ideas are in fact privately owned although they are all from us : youtube, fb, reddit, even google apparently can remove content from appearing when you search for it. the point of free speech is partially being able to speak freely without fear of persecution, but the other important point is being able to exercise it in the first place, share your thoughts and ideas. people don't need to listen to them, but if your thoughts and ideas are virtually removed from every platform accessible to a normal person, this is the equivalent of burning books. you are made invisible. another aspect of it which oddly many other liberals seem to not care about is my right as a consumer of ideas to have access to everything and choose for myself what is good and what is bad for me. the discussion is often phrased as to protect people from upsetting content, but even if the content is trashing everything important to me and relevant to my identity, it is so much more disrespectful for someone else to decide that i should be protected from the chance of being exposed to it after which i can easily ignore it. again, it is book burning. , free speech is only your true value if it can actually be heard. having said that, i completely understand that certain environments need to exist where content is censored for two reasons first is that the content is very specific or that the whole point is some very specific formatting of submitted ideas e. g. changemyview can't accept askreddit posts, a channel focused on history can't show sitcoms . that is fine, compartmentalization is ok as long as the rules of it are clear and there is possibility for all kinds of content to be developed in it's own compartment. second is the emotional need for people to have safe spaces where their own ideas never get questioned or provoked again, this is fine too as long as everyone is entitled to the same, and opposite spaces. the real fear is free speech can influence people to do violent things, but i think that nothing short of providing illegal information e. g. doxxing an individual, or telling people where to go buy illegal weapons and organizing attacks should matter. art has since its inception had the liberty to examine all kinds of topics in its own way. some of the greatest works of literature include a book that is written from a pedophile's pov, book from a killer's pov, serial killer's pov there are classic paintings depicting torture and suffering. songs that talk about war, violence and hatred. human mind can go to dark places and get incredible inspiration from them that can intellectually enrich us. understanding the world around us, the good, the bad and the ugly, makes us informed. there will always be someone who snapps and who will go and do horrible things, and at every moment in time there was something else to blame for it satanic influence, a book, a song, a movie, a video game, a youtube video as we move through time these scapegoats are always whatever is relevant and still pretty new, but the principle is the same. actions are the responsibility of the person who committed them, ideas and thoughts need to remain visible for us to see, judge, discuss etc. there are bad ideas and bad ideologies, but the only way they should be addressed is though better ideas and better ideologies, not removal. furthermore, in judging what is a bad idea ideology, there is huge hypocrisy. many, maybe all, big and popular ideologies have resulted with some misinterpretation, radicalism, violence and harm to others from religions, to systems like communism, capitalism etc. so it is completely disingenuous to talk about misinterpretation when convenient but run and ban a piece of writing or a youtube video which is much less popular as soon as it gets linked to something violent. if a privately owned platform has a monopoly over communication, then they should be obliged to withhold the ideological principles of free speech, and the fact that they are pushed to do the opposite is shameful. in fear of bad ideas getting through, we are making it so that few people decide which ideas we can hear in the first place. you can't honestly stand by free speech and be ok with this as long as it affects ideas you don't like either. gt; the value of free speech us 1st amendment is completely compromised if you exclude from it the private platforms which have complete monopoly over communications, and idea knowledge exchange. if this is a true value you hold, you would insist that the principle of it is maintained so that no idea gets muted, and respect the dignity of the consumers of ideas to choose for themselves what to take in and what to make of it. what is the point of free speech if you can't exercise it?",Privately held company that do not allow you to

147,t3_bg6omw,"my wife and i are having a disagreement about what home to finalize on. here's the breakdown: my wife and i have a combined income of about 300k. we live in the sf bay area. we both put 15 of our income into espp and max out our 401k. this results in about 8. 8k take home pay before espp being taken out, or 12k per month if we factor in the espp that's taken out. we have about 370k saved up to put towards a home down payment. i get about 25k in restricted stock per year divided up quarterly . amp; x200b; here's why i think we should stick with a 1m starter home instead of a 1. 3m: more money to spend as we want. this is big for both of us. we're both 30, and want to travel. if we go with the 1m home, then we will be able to save about 4k a month instead of about 2. 6k month due to a smaller mortgage. that means on average we will have 1. 5k we can use whatever on per month that we would not have otherwise had. more money for the future. we expect to have children in about 4 7 years. this will give us a head start on saving up cash for them. pay less interest over 10 year term we expect to stay in the house. i looked at zillow's ammortization calculator and we end up paying a crazy amount of interest. a cheaper house means we can pay off our mortgage faster before we shift to a bigger home and forfeit less money to the bank. forfeiting stock growth . if we go with this approach, we'd have to sell our espp as soon as they vest otherwise we'll be burning into our savings. yes, i realize this is take home pay we would have used on stocks etfs anyway, but this leaves no chance for the espp stock to grow and we work at pretty big tech companies that i expect the stock to keep going up. therefore we're giving up potential growth of our portfolio. better prepared if a recession hits. i've been hearing that a recession could hit in the next few years. if we do end up seeing a recession, and if one of us by chance gets fired not that we're expecting to , then we can better support ourselves with one person working until we can get rehired. amp; x200b; couple arguments my wife is making in favor of 1. 3m: the more expensive house is in a better location for commutes. the more expensive home is in mountain view, which is more strategically located along a commuter line and goes against the traffic to san jose, making us better situated for future jobs. the other one is located more east closer to san jose, which goes against the traffic and is hell to drive through. while i agree, i don't know if this is worth a 200k difference the more expensive house is likely to appreciate better. it's in a better school district, and the house is newer so those are long term gains we will realize later, not in the near term. the 1m apartment hasn't appreciated much in the past few years, esp. given it's a condo aka glorified apartment . the 1m house is older . the 1. 3m house is a brand new construction townhome, whereas the 1m would be a condo both 2 bed 2baths . she doesn't like the fact that it smells a bit. the newer home is 'our home' and has its own garage, etc. fiber internet. the old house only supports up to 250 mbps, which i think is more than enough for conference video calls, etc. we will get higher compensation. generally we've both been getting smaller upticks in stock bonuses and minor raises every year, so she's arguing that it's not right to look at this in a snapshot, but rather account for the fact that our total compensation will go up in the coming years. amp; x200b; i'm not convinced the above arguments are enough to say we should go dump 200k more into our mortgage, but would love to see if someone can tip me over the fence with some arguments that haven't been brought up above maybe from folks who have more wisdom about this space than i.","School district: I think we should stick with a 1m starter home instead of a 1.5m house. amp; X200b; couple arguments my wife is making in favor of 1. 5m: more money to spend as we want. more money for the future. less money for a recession. better prepared if a recession hits. less debt. less interest over 10 year term we expect to stay in the house. this will give us a head start on saving up cash for them. if we do end up seeing a recession, we can better support ourselves with",joint-learning

182,t3_asaizc,"1. violation of human rights, so a trial: involuntary commitment to mental institutions is a serious violation of human rights such as right to freedom, right to privacy and right to dignity. it's common practice to lock people up, take away their phones, not allowing them to meet anyone, not allowing them to leave the premises and then feeding medications against their will. it's a silent punishment for a crime they didn't commit. it's way worse than locking people up in a jail for murder, because they on the other hand are allowed to have lawyers, question the judgment in a higher court, appeal to the state etc. in other words they are recognized by state and people. so when the nature of 'punishment' is mostly same, why can't be the process too? assume sanity and anyone claiming otherwise must provide evidences. proven 'guilty' would mean that its a unanimous decision for the better of society or the person is 'insane' and incapable of independence. proven 'innocent' would mean that the person is not a threat to anyone including himself, is capable of independence and as such doesn't need to be restrained. i'd allow 'impulsively' suicidal or sh tendencies to be restrained but not others. 2. corruption: private institutions, rehab facilities etc. can deem anyone mentally unfit with mild distress and order immediate hospitalization to make huge sums of money and fear no one if they have the nod of the caregiver, exploiting the individual who is vulnerable. it can be used as a tool to exercise hidden vendetta or social control. there are laws but most people aren't aware of their rights before it's too late. here the 'doctor' is the jury of a person's fate, a jury who only earns his bread if he deems people as guilty. there are no private courts for trial of a felony, neither for punishment of one, even if the person claims to be an expert in criminal law or have an experience in judgment like a former jury , because it'd be illegal as well as unethical to do something like that, for the same reasons they don't have the authority to decide people's fate and might have incentives in giving judgments in a certain way. this argument is only applicable to mental health and not other medical fields because unlike others, mental health has no 'tests' to come to a diagnosis. amp; x200b;","Human rights should be made available for law enforcement to be used by the state and for judicial and punishment, in other words, trial or punishment should be available by state or court.",pipeline-learning

203,t3_c7ij48,"i'll start this with a link to a pdf of ur fascism 1. cult of tradition this is probably the most abstract of eco's points. it's not just tradition in the sense of older values, but also a combination of various values into a syncretic, but also contradictory ideology. like how many conservatives consider the us to founded on 'judeo christian values' while ignoring anything from the founding fathers that goes against that. or using religion to justify conservatism on every stance but ignoring any part of their own religion that goes against them which i'll expand on for point 4 . 2. rejection of modernism we see the gop reject modernism constantly. the whole 'back in my day' line may be somewhat of a joke nowadays, but there is a serious contingent of people in america that genuinely think modern advances have made the world a worse place. whether this be rejection of technological advances like automation, the internet, and cell phones, or advances in modern ideology and thinking, most of which is highly secular. 3. action for action's sake i'll let mr. eco's words here prove most of my point: gt;action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. thinking is a form of emasculation. therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of ur fascism, from goering s alleged statement when i hear talk of culture i reach for my gun to the frequent use of such expressions as degenerate intellectuals, eggheads, effete snobs, universities are a nest of reds. i don't think i need to delve too deeply into the gop's rejection of higher education and intellectuals. how often do we hear that college is a 'breeding ground for leftists socialists liberals atheists'? 4. religious opposition to critical analysis gt;no syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. the critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. in modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. for ur fascism, disagreement is treason. there is a very common thing among many religious conservative groups, evangelicals in particular. anyone who has read the bible should be able to tell that jesus was not a very conservative figure. in fact many biblical figures who various 'liberal' ideas. especially on immigration and the poor wealthy. exodus 22:21 moses gives god s law: you shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien; for you were aliens in the land of egypt. leviticus 19:33 34 and 24:22 when the alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. the alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of egypt: i am the lord your god. deuteronomy 24:14 you shall not withhold the wages of poor and needy laborers, whether other israelites or aliens who reside in your land luke 16:13 no servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. you cannot serve god and money. proverbs 28:20 a faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished. mark 10:25 'children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of god! it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god. ' if you use any of these bible verses, or any others which oppose conservative thinking, it will by and large be met with immediate rejection. this is because the kind of faith held by so many conservative christians is an immutable kind of faith. these kind of people hold that their beliefs are the true beliefs of the bible and therefore the mere act of questioning these beliefs is tantamount to betraying god. 5. fear of difference we see this most clearly today with the vilification of immigrants, previously with muslims after 9 11, and always african americans. i mean, how often has trump literally used the words 'invaders' to describe the people migrating towards the us. no one in america would stand for the way immigrant children are being treated if it was happening to citizens, or even probably just white immigrants. but the hispanic immigrant has become an 'other' to the modern gop. 6. appeal to economic anxiety gt;ur fascism derives from individual or social frustration. that is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. in our time, when the old proletarians are becoming petty bourgeois and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene , the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority again i think eco himself shows the link and i don't think i need to go too deep describing how the gop uses the 'others' to stir fear among working class people. industrial and mining jobs are drying up and white people are set to lose their status as a majority within the us over the next few decades. perfect time to exploit fear. the white hegemony on american politics is dying, and to a privileged class that feels like oppression. 7. obsession with a plot globalism deep state. seems obvious enough 8. enemies who are simultaneously overwhelmingly strong and pathetically weak this type of thinking was most obviously seen in how nazi germany viewed jewish people. now we see it with sjw's or liberals in general. on one hand, the average 'liberal sjw' is ripping up the social fabric of america and actively undermining the government. at the same time, the average 'liberal sjw' is a weak willed pushover who cries whenever someone disagrees with them and can never leave their parent's home because they can't handle reality. 9. pacifism is trafficking with the enemy because life is permanent warfare. it was conservatives who invaded afghanistan and iraq twice . yes there were some liberals who got wrapped up during the initial zealousness after 9 11, but it has always been conservatives who have the most 'troop worship'. the simple act of saying we should decrease military spending is often related to somehow betraying 'the troops'. and this isn't just warfare in the sense of invading another nation, like it seems trump and bolton want to do with iran. conservatives have led several domestic 'wars' too, drugs, terrorism, and now i would say immigration. i mean we know how disastrous the war on drugs was, but almost every conservative will still defend it and take a 'hard on crime' approach. fascism requires a constant enemy, and the gop has always had an enemy to be found. 10. contempt for the weak how often do we see rhetoric blaming poor people for their own misfortune from the right? 'pull yourself up by your bootstrap' kind of thinking has infested modern us conservatism. if you are poor in america, it is your own fault most republicans say. eco also had another point along with this: gt; every citizen belongs to the best people of the world, the members of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can or ought to become a member of the party american exceptionalism, literally this except the party part, is also a huge part of conservative thinking. 11. everybody is a hero this again ties most clearly into military troop worship. but there is also no shortage of it domestically too. how many right wing anti government militias, or just average joes, are there that purport themselves to be the guardians of freedom and liberty? this point also has to do with glorification of death. how often do you hear stuff like 'the government can take my guns from my cold dead hands'? it's not just about their guns, but about heroically dying against a government they view as oppressive. 12. machismo eco's words here are pretty self explanatory with how they relate to the gop. gt; since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, the ur fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters. this is the origin of machismo which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality . since even sex is a difficult game to play, the ur fascist hero tends to play with weapons doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise 13. selective populism for a fascist, people are not considered individuals within the realm of politics and government, but rather a single entity for whom the leader in our case trump acts as their interpreter. now obviously the people are not a single entity because there are various views on every topic, but fascism demands order and similarity, and as eco wrote earlier disagreement is diversity, and diversity is the enemy. so the leader can choose a group of people who become 'the people' and all others are then exactly that 'others'. and we already know how fascists view 'others'. 14. newspeak the simplification or changing of language to simplify an issue as to reduce critical thinking. rather than debating the merits of the aca, you can simply say 'death panel'. rather than talk about if and how earth should be inherited you can simply say 'death tax'. i will happily accept arguments debating how i relate the gop to these points, the validity of ur fascism itself, or any other angle i have overlooked. i can also talk more on any of these points, i just didn't want the post to be a huge block of text."," Using Ur-Fascism by Umberto Eco as a guideline, the GOP is a fascist party.",ground-truth

266,t3_cxwghe,"incest is probably the most widely spread taboo in human culture, but i find all the argument against it to be inconsistent. 1 'incest produces offspring with disabilities' : this one is only partially true. incest itself doesn't increase the chances of genetic disorders, and everyone that remembers gregor mendel's studies should know that. but beside this, incest is a sexual activity between closely related individuals, so it doesn't really require procreation, as it comprehends non reproductive activities such as oral sex and anal sex, as well as safe sex to avoid unwanted pregnancies. banning the sexual intercourse to prevent the pregnancy seems excessive to me. also, if the two individuals are homosexual, the problem of a pregnancy is non existent. another counter argument could be: if we prohibit incest to prevent the birth of a child with genetic disorders, does that mean that we should also forbid people who have genetic disorders or carry a recessive gene that may cause a disorder to reproduce? 2 'incest is abuse rape pedophilia' : i get this, because the majority of reported cases of incest usually involve an older relative that violates a younger one e. g. a father and his daughter or a brother and a younger sister , but i think that this argument misses the point. the thing that makes these sexual acts immoral and punishable is not the fact that they involve two close relatives, but the fact that they are non consensual and or feature an adult having sex with a minor. a consensual intercourse between two adults is not harmful. 3 incest is disgusting : this is probably the argument that i understand the most, but also the most fallacious one. nothing can be considered inherently wrong just because it's considered disgusting by one's subjective views. it's not wrong to eat garlic bread with strawberry jam , even though many people including me would consider it disgusting.",Individuals should be allowed to engage in incest.,joint-learning

280,t3_cyu2hp,"this is going to be a long post but it's something i've been thinking about recently, so i thought i'd share my thoughts and see what people have to say. i was spurred to write this after waking up to the notification of yet another shooting that happened in texas a few days ago. i think that almost every single bit of rhetoric surrounding mass shootings is completely pointless nonsense, or at the very least not helpful. every time one of these tragedies happen, people repeat the same talking points over and over, and yet nothing seems to be getting done politically because nothing can be done, but we'll get to that later , because this isn't a political problem, it's a cultural one; not to say that politics aren't a part of culture, or that political terrorism hasn't taken the form of blind violence as it obviously has especially recently , but repeated tragedies such as the ones that seem to be happening all around us, that strike us on such a personal level, on both the scale and volume they seem to be occurring, requires a deeper analysis on the conditions that lead people to commit these violent acts beyond 'it's the guns' or 'it's psych meds' or 'it's trump' or 'it's the news' or whatever else. first, we must identify why the common explanations for these shootings are incorrect, or at the very least ill informed, and then, we have to identify the real cause. 1. it's the news media; shooters all want to become famous. i don't buy this. now, don't get me wrong. the media has definitely played a role in the normalization of these occurrences. however, there are a number of things that people aren't putting into perspective. first of all, it's not 'the media's' fault. if it weren't fox news or cnn or some other conglomerate reporting on these things, it would be the hundreds of thousands of clickbait news article websites, social media homepages, or, you guessed it, reddit, posting about it for the world to see. massive tragedies like these are never, ever going to just be sweat under the rug in the current social media landscape and they never will be, ever again, and i'm not sure if they were to be, that it would even be a good thing. is it not ok for people to know that these things are going on, who's doing them, and why? i think it is. now, people could argue that copy cat occurrences are through the roof because of the over reporting of these tragedies, however, it's not obvious that if all reporting ended from this point on, that people would just stop killing each other by the dozens. there have probably been a few shooters who have gone on their rampages to inspire a week's worth of cheap notoriety, but think about it: nobody who isn't already on the edge of a violent outburst, who's willing to end the lives of as many innocent strangers as they possibly can in the shortest amount of time possible, before either blowing their own brains out or spending the rest of their life in a prison cell, is going to do something like this for such a small payoff. the act itself is the motivation; notoriety may be to these people the proverbial 'icing on the cake' but it's not why they're committing the act; if that were the case, columbine never would have happened and neither would any of the shootings that happened afterwards. mass shooters are people just like you and me, they know that their time in the spotlight is only going to last for as long as the media can milk their story before the next one comes around, so i find it very hard to believe that any rational person would commit a shooting for that. now, you could argue that these people aren't rational, and it wouldn't matter to them anyways because they know their lives are going to be either literally or essentially over after the fact anyways, and that's likely part of the motivation to begin with! you wouldn't be wrong, like i said, the reporting and copy cat culture it's created is a problem but it's not one that we can do anything about and it's not something that's ever going to change at this point, so, my position stands that this rhetoric is quite literally pointless. 2. it's because we have assault weapons and it's too easy to buy guns. i don't buy this. guns are guns are guns; you aim them at things, and then things die when you pull the trigger. bullets will kill you whether they're big or small, hollow tipped or buckshot, automatically sprayed or precisely aimed at you one at a time. the hysteria surrounding the voldemort of firearms, the ar 15, is hilarious to me. most of the people appealing to these memes have probably never shot a real weapon before or been around guns in general. you don't need an 'assault weapon' to kill a lot of people. you don't need a 'fully automatic weapon' to kill a lot of people. you don't need anything aside from bullets and good aim and anybody who's proficient at any fps game can prove that to you. there isn't as big of a difference between a 'big bad assault gun' and a 'cute little handgun' as you might think if you're not in the loop. guns can be modded extensively with scopes, extended barrels, high capacity magazines, grips, lasers, flashlights, stocks, mods that turn the gun automatic, and whatever the hell else you can imagine, so the gun that the shooters use really isn't nearly as important as things such as the targeted area they're going to attack, their own stamina and aim, and most importantly, their own resolve and resilience to kill people. making guns harder to buy won't change anything at this point: there are already too many guns in america and there'll be a second civil war before the right gives them up. plus, you can't just 'make guns harder to buy' because there are no real world, applicable hoops you could put in the way of buying a firearm that would accurately weed out violent, yet to be murderers from your local redneck. there is no minority report or psycho pass style test you could give someone beforehand to determine whether or not they're going to kill a ton of people before they do; people have this cartoonish image of what a mass shooter is, like they're all trench coat wearing, half werewolf half vampire people that you can just immediately weed out as 'evil'. you can't. then, there's the problem that even if you couldn't buy them legally by any means, there are dozens of ways to get them illegally, just like with drugs, whether it be through people selling them who already have them, organized crime, 3d printing, internet black markets, or simply stealing them, it really doesn't matter. if someone is dedicated to the idea of going six stars on some poor, unsuspecting bystanders, not having immediate access to an ar 15 isn't going to be the end of that. it may just slow them down, but it's not stopping anyone. again, nothing here is going to change because of the political gridlock this country has memed itself into, so this discussion is and will remain a fruitless one. 3. it's because our country has a lack of mental health resources for the shooters. i think this one is misguided. most of the mass shooters aren't 'mentally ill'. it's not even clear to me that people who keep repeating these memes are familiar with what the term 'mentally ill' even means, or what it implies for those who actually do suffer from real mental illnesses. a violent, rampaging outburst by some idiot with a deathwish does not automatically make them 'mentally ill'. many of the people who have done these things have written manifestos explaining in painful detail exactly why they've decided to go about doing it and seem to be rationally functioning and fully engaged in the act both beforehand, and after, if they survive long enough to make it to trial. even if this country had an abundance of mental health resources, it's not obvious that these people would just forthrightly turn their lives around, seek help, and change their minds about committing a mass shooting. people who wind up doing shit like this are usually at the tail end of a very, very, very long and depressing road, driven by resentment, anger, nihilism, and narcissism. the idea that somebody who'd commit an act like this would even have the self awareness to realize that what they're doing is clearly stupid and pointless in every way contradicts the fact that they're the type of person who'd even think that it was a good idea in the first place; there are no 'fence sitting shooters'. it only adds to the problem that the healthcare system as we currently have it set up actively discourages people from coming forth with violent fantasies. just like people who commit false rape accusations aren't going to come forth and admit that they lied because of the fear of imprisonment, nobody in their right mind is going to go mouth off to some therapist about their shooter fantasies just to get institutionalized and fed pills while wearing a straight jacket in a padded cell. at the end of the day, mental health resources like therapy and medications aren't some cure all magical pill that you can push people through like a conveyor belt to turn them into happy go lucky, functioning members of society. most people who struggle with real mental health issues are stuck in a fucked up, life long struggle, even with therapy and medication at their disposal the whole time because mental illness is indiscriminate. people condescendingly push the idea of 'therapy' onto each other all the time, especially in far left echo chambers like reddit, because virtue signalling that you're woke to the idea of mental health support makes people feel like they're somehow compassionate and progressive, despite not realizing that real mental therapy is often a horrific struggle undertaken by doctors who are dealing with patients who are so fucked up in the head that you literally cannot even imagine helping them; just because therapy helped you get over your breakup or whatever other shit you went through and felt bad about for 3 weeks does not mean that it's similar in practice or in scope when dealing with people who are nearly insane and on the edge of committing a terrorist attack. 4. it's because of political polarization and radical, reactionary positions by far right leaning bigots. i think this has some merits, only insofar as the killers admit to doing their shooting for political reasons. it doesn't explain the rest, and it doesn't explain the meta problem, which is why people are willing to go to such extremes in the first place before engaging in some other form of literally anything else. 5. it's because of bullying in schools. again, this only has merits insofar as the killers admit to doing their shooting for this reason in particular, and given that the vast majority of mass shooters seem to be at the very least in their late 20's, i find it hard to believe that bullying is the cause, not in the least because many, many, many people get bullied in school and 99. 9999999 of them don't go terminator light yagami sicko mode on their entire classroom for it. 6. it's because of video games, rock music, gay marriage, whatever the fuck else. fuck off with that dumb shit.",Video game developers should stop talking about mass shootings.,joint-learning

287,t3_bb5n12,"on this subreddit, other subreddits, the internet in general, and in real life, there is controversy on using the word 'black' versus using the word 'african american'. the problem with this debate is that it is describing two mostly different concepts. amp; x200b; 'black' is a race a large group of people who look similar . a black person is generally means a dark skinned person who is probably of african or melanesian descent regardless of their ethnicity or nationality. amp; x200b; 'african american' is an ethnicity a group of people who have the same language, religion, culture, ancestry, history and or background . african american typically refers to the people who are descended from african slaves brought to the southeastern united states from 1619 until 1865. amp; x200b; the big confusion is that not a lot of people know sociology well and they think that 'race', 'ethnicity', and 'nationality' all mean the same thing. african american is thought to be a synonym for black people in general, but that is wrong. calling all black people 'african american' is like calling all east asian looking people 'han chinese'. you cannot assume a person's ethnic group by physical appearance alone. amp; x200b; the 'african' part in african american solely refers to a person's ancestry genetics, it does not have anything to do with language or culture there is no one african language or single african culture . the 'american' part refers to the united states of america. african immigrants to the usa generally have their own specific ethnic group they are a part of like 'yoruba' or 'afrikaner' or 'afro haitian', so while calling african immigrants or caribbean immigrants 'african american' is correct in the nationality sense, those people are not a part of the african american ethnic group due to having a different culture, genetics, and history compared to the descendants of slaves who have been living in the usa for centuries. amp; x200b; let me use another example. if i want to describe the descendants of african slaves in trinidad and tobago 'afro trinidadian' is the best term to use. with that word, the reader not only knows what race the group of people in question are black and what their nationality is trinidad and tobagonian , but they also know that i am referring to a very specific group of people with a very specific culture and history regardless of where these group of people are currently located . using the word 'black' wouldn't be useful because there are billions of black people spread across dozens of nations and the definition of 'black' changes depending on the nation and time period . using the word 'trinidadian and tobagonian' wouldn't be useful because there are several ethnicities within trinidad and tobago and 37 of the island's ethnic population is indo trinidadian . amp; x200b; in order to change my view, you have to provide an alternative term to use when referring to the group of people descended from african slaves within the usa. because that is the whole purpose of the word, to differentiate that group of people from other ethnicities like afro puerto ricans or south asian americans. 'black american' could work, although that currently means anybody within the confines of the us that is generally black. 'descendant of slave american' could also work, but is kind of wordy and afro caribbeans could also fit into that category.","Internet users should stop using the word ""black"" and replace it with ""African-American"".",joint-learning

336,t3_czk6oh,"this is something i've been trying to break down in my head for a while, and i think it title holds true. i'd love to see some different points of view, however, and perhaps change my mind. there could always be an angle i haven't considered, a crucial piece of information i've missed, or a major flaw in my reasoning. let me try to explain my position: 1 humans are the product of evolution via natural selection which essentially concluded tens if not hundreds of thousands of years ago. the process of evolution requires a great amount of time, so when speaking in terms of a few hundred generations of humans an 'evolutionary present' if you will , it has a negligible additional impact, if any. 2 said evolutionary process provided us with a brain capable of higher level thinking, and it was powerful enough to allow us to survive and thrive in this ancestral environment. 3 through cooperation one of our greatest assets compared to other animals , we have managed to achieve levels of technology that would appear to be literal magic even a few hundred years ago a timescale multiple orders of magnitude faster than the timescale on which evolution acts. 4 we use emotions, instincts and general mental shortcuts biases prejudices to navigate everyday life because they have been programmed into our brain by evolution because they obviously worked in the ancestral environment . gt; to offer a few simple examples, we know that people usually choose actions according to the expected emotional response to the outcome rather than actual likelihood of outcome. we know that people tend to ignore arguments when they oppose their position, and that they get extremely defensive and inflexible when they find themselves in such a position. we also know that our thought processes are plagued with biases that are extremely hard to correct for, even if we are aware that they exist. 5 note: these pre programmed 'tools' emotions, biases etc are not bad, per se. they have the advantage of being extremely fast, much faster than conscious, rational thought. and if your major issues are more like 'do i jump off the cliff, or take my chances with the bear' and less like 'do i order takeout or cook something healthy', it makes much more sense that evolution went with the faster, more intuitive option by default. 6 our mental substrate is thus tuned to exhibit optimal responses to an environment that has ceased to be for thousands of years . instead, we live in the current, modern world. 7 in the modern world, technological advances have far outran evolution, providing us with new capabilities without us having the necessary mental ability to use them in a responsible manner. gt; i'll offer an initial example: social media. we were always social creatures, so the lure of this medium is clear. with this medium came the trend of displaying the best moments of one's life online for the approval or disapproval of strangers. alongside this trend is the aspect of comparing every moment of your own life to the highlights of everyone else's lives that you see online and this comparison has been found to contribute to depression and increased suicide rates . when given the ability to talk to everyone on the planet, most people just advertise themselves, flaunt their lifestyle or seek short term gains of some sort, while others cannot break free and just spiral into depression because of impossible standards being shown to them, sometimes leading to suicide. evolution never equipped us to be able to deal with the ability to talk to every person on the planet, or with the repercussions dopamine 'hits' as a result of online 'likes', or the depression that follows constant unfavorable comparisons . 8 this discrepancy between mental ability and technological progress puts us in a position where we easily and constantly abuse technology for short term gain as dictated by our evolution derived instincts to the long term detriment of ourselves, both on an individual and a species wide level. gt; more examples. obesity is an epidemic, currently, mainly caused by the widespread availability of extremely delicious and calorically dense foods, which are just so full of the macronutrients the brain is programmed to seek carbohydrates and fats that they become extremely hard to resist. essentially, they are a super stimulus. they are nothing like what our brain is equipped to handle, because you couldn't find artificially sweetened chocolate hanging from trees in 12,000 bce. gt; gt; internet video game addiction is also prevalent. it's mostly because our brains crave new things, and the internet and video games are near infinite sources of new information and experiences. again, they act as super stimuli which we are not equipped to handle. we don't use technology responsibly this goes for the previous example as well , because it just feels too good to just indulge even though there are documented drawbacks. gt; gt; climate change. we are nearly incapable, as a species, to sacrifice short term gain in favor of long term reward, especially if the reward is not going to be delivered to us, but to our descendants. climate change is an excellent illustration of this point collectively, we are unwilling to sacrifice our current comfortable way of life to save or at least help our own children. so, even though we have the means to live comfortably and not destroy our sensitive ecological niche, we do not we don't use our technology responsibly, because we're too tempted by short term gains again, evolution fails us here, as it programmed an intense need to go from reward to reward . this is my position. i've probably explained at least one thing poorly, so please do ask for clarifications if you think they are needed."," Humans are not, on average, mentally equipped to use modern advanced technology responsibly.",ground-truth

350,t3_cx09wr,"i have two major points that i would like to see another perspective on. amp; x200b; 1. bots reading single sources of information without the proper context can result in self fulfilling prophecies. a bot that reads the news to determine the health of the market could see something like the yield curve inverting and the subsequent news stories about how there could be a recession in the near future. this would trigger a somewhat massive selloff which would cause the stock market as a whole to tumble. another instance i can think of this happening is when trump tweets out something negative or positive about the trade war the market reacts. the first couple of times this could have been because of a lot of humans doing it, but after several times, bots were surely set up which is why there is such a massive swing one way or the other the moment trump tweets something out. this is only going to get worse as people continue to build bots to take advantage of this fact. amp; x200b; 2. algorithmic trading compromises the foundational of the how stock market is able to correctly price pieces of a company. a person can be dumb, but people are incredibly good at guessing something in aggregate the replacement of those people with machines surely must have an affect on the markets ability to price a company. humans have a guttural instinct about guessing that a machine cannot have enough inputs to replicate. also many of these algorithms are the same, buy x amount of companies that did well poorly in the past x amount of weeks and sell them after x amount of days. that's not what a human would do. they would have a 'feeling' about a company because they can see their products and see how their products affect the lives of those around them. amp; x200b; so, change my view. i particularly am interested in point 2 and the implications of algorithmic trading on the 'cow problem'.",Human-made algorithmic trading will cause the stock market to fail in the near future.,joint-learning

maybe it's just civil on your part, and maybe the other party is screaming and yelling at you; i still don't think the proper response is to get angry right back. amp; x200b; i do think that people are entitled to their own beliefs such as disagreeing with my beliefs even if i disagree with them. i think most everyone's beliefs deserve respect, although there are lines i draw when someone's health or safety is on the line. so many people have these racist, sexist, or intolerant beliefs; i don't think it's right to just discard them, or give the people up as lost causes. minds can change, and even if they can take a long time to do so, i don't think exclusion and anger are ethical. i think they're the standard way of fighting for change, positive or negative. not ideal, but it's the quickest way we've got right now; we use what works. amp; x200b; if something seems well settled in society, i usually don't bother trying to fight against it if it doesn't directly hurt people. for instance, i think the amount of livestock we raise is hurting the planet, but i support people's rights to continue to raise, slaughter, and eat them. objectively, it's not a good thing, but personally i just can't justify being against everyone who eats meat especially since i love meat. for our current reality, eating meat is socially acceptable. amp; x200b; i think that people with bigoted beliefs can have the same ability to fight for what they believe as people with more liberal progressive modern ones depending on legality, which is 100 valid . what wins out is where society heads, which is why there's this constant battle between people's beliefs. we fight for representation and change, and we'll continue to do so until the human species goes extinct. what's right and wrong is decided by the majority of a society, and if you want change you should fight for it. i'm pretty stoked i'm not oppressed or abused because i'm a woman. i think it would be terrible if i was, and that anyone else is. i wouldn't support that if it were happening around me, and if i was a braver person i'd help others change and or get out of situations like that. but i'm lazy, complacent, and a wimp, so i'm not. the same could be said for a billion other people, and i don't hate them for it. it's not our duty to make change, it's a personal choice. it's selfish, but i remain in my comfort zone; maybe talking about it a little bit with friends and family, or retweeting things, or donating when i happen to have money. i don't actually fight for anything. i don't want to change or do things just because i feel pressured to by people or society. if i decide i care enough, i'll fight for change, but right now i just don't. amp; x200b; and helping other people and making a change is fantastic, it really is i admire a lot of you guys who do that but god it takes so much effort. i don't expect effort from anybody. amp; x200b; maybe i need to know what it's like for other, suffering people to really understand it. that's not enforceable, though; we can't know, because we haven't experienced it and it's unethical to send someone out to 'gain experience' and suffer. classes and experiments like jane elliot's can only go so far. it'd be amazing if everyone could understand everyone, or just a few someones, but that's not how it is. amp; x200b; amp; x200b; part 2 and now, to my other question. is it racist to not be immediately attracted to someone based on their appearance? for instance, if someone doesn't find black skin appealing right off the bat, but does find the person attractive as they learn about the person and their personality, is that racist? i am personally not immediately attracted to all sorts of people, but learn to find them more and more attractive the more i learn and like their personality. a lot of people consider potential partners based on looks; someone might really love redheads, another might be crazy over flawless skin. a lot of these things are out of our control, just as skin color or gender are; we may, unconsciously or consciously, exclude certain people based on preferences for things they can't or shouldn't have to change. i'm not saying it's a good thing, but we all have preferences, and that doesn't make you a bigot. amp; x200b; a bit more difficult is the question of 'is it transphobic for a bisexual person to not date trans people? ' i think it's a pretty fine line, since trans people identify as either male or female the two genders a bisexual person is, by definition, said to be attracted to. but beyond technicalities, i can kind of understand why a bisexual person may not be attracted to a trans person if they don't pass, or totally look like a guy or a girl. amp; x200b; and genitals are a pretty big factor in deciding what gender you like, although i'm mainly referring to heterosexual persons with that. is it wrong for a heterosexual person to not find a transgender person attractive or to no longer want to date them once they find out they're trans? i personally think it's ok, but i could 100 see how that'd be really upsetting. i'll just throw in that i think it's also ok to not want to date someone based on their physical or mental health. not good, but ok. amp; x200b; however, it is not okay to not be friends with somebody based on their looks, religion, or gender identity. mental and physical health gets confusing. and while i say it's 'not okay' it's still valid, if sucky.","Racism, sexism, and intolerance are not ethical, and should not be tolerated.",joint-learning

' 1. racism stereotyping prejudice when driving down the street, if i see a big black fat man with tattoos sagging his gym shorts in his socks slide sandals, i catch myself thinking 'wow i wonder if he contributes a ton to society or if he hates police and idolizes rap music. ' this is bad. i don't understand where this view of racism came from because my parents are not from what i understand directly racist. i don't have any negative things to say about chinese japanese taiwanese korean people. i have mild complaints that hispanic people are typically untrustworthy loud, etc. i am failing to understand where racism begins and stereotyping based on evidence ends. 1. homophobia transphobia i believed for probably 15 conscious years that being gay was 100 a choice until i read that it exists in the animal kingdom naturally and it isn't because somebody watched will and grace growing up. i think two gay men being romantic is gross. two attractive women being romantic is arousing, to complete the double standard. i think transphobia is some form of disease. there may be a handful of cases where people are born as the wrong gender, but i believe the fact that the media society are broadcasting its popularity is causing more sick twisted attention seeking individuals to partake. 1. body shaming i am personally disgusted by most fat people. if you're above a 30 35 body fat range, i'm pretty convinced that you have no self control, don't care about yourself, and are a burden to society in terms of health insurance. it blows my mind that girls who weight 250 300lbs can get dressed in 'cute, hot sexy tight' clothes and be told they should feel beautiful when in reality they need to be told to put down the fork. even if you make the arguments 'all body types are different' or 'somebody is going through something, cut them some slack, maybe he she is depressed', i feel there should be an active effort to be healthy within 6 12 months. being ugly is subjective. being unhealthy and fat is objective. 1. sexism i don't find myself being too sexist i don't struggle with this one the most. i do catch myself judging women working in positions of power for having different management styles than men. for example, i've seen a female manager throw a hissyfit cry scream be dramatic. do men do this too? absolutely. but, on average, a woman being in a position of power puts the employees at a statistically higher risk of dealing with her emotions than a male. tl;dr i've got some seriously fucked up societal views. i'm only aware they are fucked up because of how many heads i have butt on reddit. mass downvotes, being banned, etc. what's the answer? is it that reddit is a bubble of super vocal hypersensitive social justice warriors? am i allowed to keep my views? how many others share similar views to me? where are they to speak up when i am getting mass downvoted on reddit? why does everybody disagree with me online, but i lead a perfectly functional successful life in person? are a lot of the arguments made online more 'theory' and fall apart 'in practice' reality? the climatic culture is changing, no doubt. if you're homophobic in 2019, it's a problem. you'll get your ass kicked 6 ways to sunday letting people online know you're racist homophobic. what is society going to do about it? are the views i hold and other similar views that aren't the latest and greatest 2019 supercharged climate going to make a comeback? are they dying overtime? am i allowed entitled to hold my views? why do people online get to call me dumb for holding my views, believing their views are better than mine? who gets to say who has the better opinions morals views?",Human voice matters and shouldn't exist on the internet,pipeline-learning

' this is brought to light when the capitalists who effectively run western countries as a dictatorship, are best buddies with the most barbaric countries with 0 human rights, such as saudi arabia. in practice, these don't mean anything. what is the 'rule of law? ' it is not actually the rule of law. it is the rule of those most powerful, who create their own laws, then justify it by saying it is 'rule of law. ' other than a system of checks and balances, there is no such thing as 'rule of law. ' in practice, all it means is that one guy can't just say 'today i will govern however i want. ' but in practice, it is very easy to skirt. if you have enough money power, or if you join forces with others who have enough money power, you will get your way. that's all it takes. so let's not pretend that words such as 'rule of law' magically make things better. at the same time, it is not like dictators have wanton power to do whatever they want, outside of extreme, isolated cases. they still have to keep people happy to a certain degree, otherwise they will meet their end. in the west, 'libertarianism' is fetishized and worshiped heavily. however, this is mostly just an ideal. in practice it leads to corruption. westerners are so obsessed with being 'liberal' and 'democratic' that they have become slaves under their own system. they fear 'dictatorship' so much but don't realize that their system is not much different. when you take away power from the state and give the private sector too much power, as is the principle of libertarianism, what happens is the private sector takes over the state, and they become the dictators. that is best seen in the usa. they are so afraid of 'dictatorship' and love 'freedom' so much that their state governments have, in practice, been sold to the highest bidders in the private sector, who answer to nobody, and have nobody's interests in mind other than their own quarterly profits. these selfish psychopaths have caused so many problems for both americans and others. they have gotten so powerful that the us military, people's sons and daughters, have been sent to slaughter as a private army for them, in places like vietnam and iraq, just to further boost their personal profits, by violently trying to install their corporations in countries that rejected them, and to bomb and get contracts to rebuild bombed countries. the fact is that at the end of the day, there needs to be a strong authority who will crush anybody who attempts to hurt the population for selfish purposes. the risk of dictatorship is worth it. the word 'dictator' has such a bad connotation in the west due to decades of brainwashing by the capitalists de factor dictators in these countries who are threatened by the idea of a strong central authority who will prevent them from abusing the population for unlimited and irresponsible self gain. unless a dictator is an absolute psychopath, he will not randomly try to make life hell for his people for the fuck of it. even when we look at north korea, the reason the people are starving there is because the capitalists who run the us put an embargo on them: because they reject mcdonalds and nike, they must starve. they will also be invaded the second their military gets weak, so they are forced to spend money on nukes and military instead of feeding their people. yes i know the north korean leaders are bad and everything, their system is also part of the problem, but we cannot ignore these broader facts. in the west, someone who is born rich is said to 'deserve' his 125 oversea villas, yet people in the west get all uptight if a 'dictator' has 1 summer villa. he is 'evil' for doing so. it is baffling, the level of brainwashing that has occurred for people to be thinking like this. i would rather have 1 dictator who has a mansion while protecting everyone else and providing everybody with the necessities of life, as opposed to a jungle system of the highest bidder in the private sector taking over the government and deciding policy for me and others, with absolutely 0 regard for my health, happiness, and safety.","Lawrence Taylor's ""rule of law"" is an oxymoron.",joint-learning

434,t3_cjbqd2,"my main points are these: 99 of european graffiti is tagging the graffitist rapidly writing his nickname rather than murals of high aesthetic value. for every banksy, there are 99 graffitists scrawling their tags with little complexity and poor composition. tagging looks pretty much the same regardless of place: bubbly letters, exclamation points, asterisks, etc. tags have very a very limited visual vocabulary compared to all the symbolism and techniques in the history of art. when images are drawn, they are overwhelmingly intended to frighten skulls, guns, caricatures of ethnicities, etc. . they expose children and families to threatening and violent imagery in their daily lives. over the last 30 years, europe has gone from having almost no tagging, to tags being in virtually every town and city, all along the highways and railways, and even in natural parks. europe, therefore, is beginning to look the same everywhere at eye level , no matter where you go. tagging increasingly draws our attention away from the beautiful architecture and landscapes of europe, to its garish, repetitive, incomprehensible lettering. tagger culture is proud of its illegality, shock value, and semantic impenetrability. the motto of r bombing bombing means going to a place and tagging as much as possible is 'less art, more vandalism'. academics' tendency to romanticize graffiti as 'street art' originates in a flawed conception that european graffiti is an expression of the voice of the margnalized. it was that in new york in the 1970s, where it originated. but it is not that in europe. rather, taggers are almost all young, white men the opposite of the marginalized. european tagging is almost never performed by the truly disenfranchised, like immigrants, roma, or the mentally ill or drug dependent. most of them can't afford the paint. ethnic europeans write on the walls; darker skinned immigrants have to look at it. tagging is therefore an expression of white privilege . furthermore, it is often performed in places that are dark and unpoliced, where women often fear to go because of the continuing epidemic of gender based violence. tagging is therefore an expression of male privilege . illegal tagging violates the vision of the architects and community which approved the architecture. taggers sometimes claim that they are simply beautifying drab, modern walls. however, these were the product of community compromise. tagging is therefore violence against that compromise. taggers compete with each other and post their work online in a constant act of one upsmanship among a secretive community, like fight club, complete with fight club uniform black hoodies and fight club profanity. all this is a hypermasculine display. spray paint used by taggers is environmentally unfriendly and when it invariably comes off the walls, it ends up in our water supply, rivers, oceans, etc. political graffiti also exists and almost all of it is either radically right wing think swastikas or left wing think communist, violent overthrow of state . european graffiti is therefore one of the most odious manifestations of globalism: it is violence against local communal architectural and aesthetic decision making, performed mostly by europe's most privileged residents, and therefore an public imposition of anti social political tendencies on the continent. if you'd like more fully developed arguments, i've written a longer essay with my ideas about graffiti in europe here",Ethnic group graffiti is an expression of male privilege,pipeline-learning

483,t3_cjel5h,"hello all. first of all, i'm a long time lurker both in this community and on reddit in general but i've never made a post on r changemyview before. i've had some varying feelings about birth control and related topics throughout my life and i think part of the reason is that i can generally see the different perspectives so well. however, one thing that i've recently been thinking about is the morality of birth control. my sister recently started taking birth control pills and the medical guide that came with her prescription says that it does not consistently prevent ovulation and that a backup mechanism for preventing pregnancy is preventing implantation. in that case, a fertilized egg can pass out through the body, which of course means it will no longer develop and will no longer live or 'live' . my sister says that maybe it's not really alive it's just 'viable' but i do not see this as a 'when does life begin? ' question. i think life began a long, long time ago at the evolutionary beginning of life on earth, and that every sperm, egg, cell, etc. has been alive since. however, a fertilized egg is genetically unique and has begun dividing and growing and has started the long process towards birth. i do not think that preventing pregnancy is wrong. i just do not feel good about essentially ending a very, very young life, as i see it, that just won the genetic lottery to exist. i'll add that none of this has any religious foundation for me, whatsoever. it is grounded only in what i see as logical and right. oddly, i i believe abortion can be moral. i think that a woman's first duty is to herself, and that she can make the choice she feels is best for her own physical and mental health. many people believe that a woman has the right to abort a pregnancy if her life is at risk. i think that this extends to her health, her mental health, etc. she has the right to choose how much risk she assumes. you only get one body, and the process of pregnancy and birth can have complications and even in the best of circumstances can affect the mother adversely. i also believe that being miserable, feeling forced to carry a child, or feeling that there is an invader parasite in her body, is a valid reason to abort and could cause massive harms to the woman and her mental health overall wellbeing. no woman should feel that she is a slave or that someone else's needs prioritize her own bodily integrity. no woman should be forced to accept risk of pain, bodily harm, sickness, depression, etc. so, while i'm not sure i approve of abortion in all cases, i do support it in as much as it's ever a health decision. i also know that many women decide to abort for other reasons, and while they have my respect and i know that it can be a tough decision that may be appealing for various reasons, i don't really think these are okay. with birth control, however, there are other options to prevent pregnancy that do not prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. since this is true, i'd argue, we should make the choice that does not stop a life. i understand that a woman may become pregnant because she did not decide to use this type of birth control and therefore she ends up in a position where she wants to abort. i think that again, she has to prioritize her own health and wellbeing. however, i think she should have taken action, to the best of her ability, from getting pregnant in the first place via other means than this type of birth control . but regardless she can only do her best in the situation she's currently in, not rewind and change the past. i do think that planning on this all along would also be immoral 'i'll just not worry about birth control and i'll try to have an abortion because abortion is moral' does not fit my view, and is in itself another wrong. but if that's where she already is, all she can do is go forward. i do believe that, given the choice, it is likely also better to end a pregnancy as early as possible, but i don't think it makes a tremendous amount of difference ethically. i do understand that a woman isn't considered pregnant until implantation takes place. i don't think that that really changes whether the embryo fetus etc. is alive or whatever other word suggests that it is deserving of life . in the same way, i don't see birth as an inherent threshold either. birth changes whether a baby fetus etc. relies on its mother for life giving her the right to make her own health decisions but it doesn't change other reasons for abortion, in my opinion. for example, i don't think that aborting due to serious illness in the fetus baby is significantly different from euthanasia of a very seriously ill baby after birth. anyway, this is what i believe, but i think that i may be missing something that would change my view. why? well, first, most people don't believe this, although that's not inherently proof that i'm wrong. again, my views are not based on religion in any way whatsoever, but even conservative religious arguments that i've read against birth control don't generally use my argument. also, i'd like to believe that there isn't this mass wave of immorality taking place that kills tiny, growing lives every day. i'd like to believe that these types of birth control, giving women and families additional options to prevent pregnancy and which may be better suited to certain circumstances, can be considered okay. i also find my approval of abortion is a bit odd, considering, and i think that digging around there could possibly lead to some cognitive dissonance. there are also some other areas i think i could explore, but i haven't really hashed them out enough to discuss here and i don't want to write your arguments for you. ; but please, change my view!",Mental health or reproductive control should be enforced upon birth control.,pipeline-learning

511,t3_cvhwv3,"i wrote this to another user in a private dm and figured, why not share it with a broader audience: i don't know if i'm left or right; i just want to reduce unnecessary suffering. i've attended a few bernie events and i've tried hard to believe that canvassing and voter engagement have the power to address a lot of the world's issues under the right conditions, but even choosing a particular politician feels ineffectual to me. i could be jaded, but i'd like to assume the worst case and explore accordingly. i have a hard time betting my future on the transience and ideological vulnerability of a single human being. if some politician comes up with all of the best, most humanitarian, egalitarian, achievable ideas with a strategy to boot, their success and our future equally depend on the little constellation of proprietary technical details that are ridiculously easy to sabotage since they're both concentrated and temporary. the traditional political vector is as important as it's ever been, but it scares me to think that it's far from sufficient since the institutional attack vectors are far more sophisticated and far reaching than they've ever been advanced gerrymandering, mainstream media, information 'warfare' through social media, concentrated efforts to discrscience and empiricism, divisive rhetoric, rampant anti intellectualism, etc . i'm a systems engineering consultant by profession, so i tend to think like an engineer. i break systems down and put them back together in ways that are cheaper, more sustainable, and suitable for everyone not just the product owners with short term incentives. it's my job to advocate for all parties and rearchitect systems such that all interests are accounted for. if you break down the world's most pressing issues, you can see pretty clearly that they're largely rooted in unchecked capitalism. it seems to me that many of the world's biggest problems could be addressed quickly through an alignment of our collective productive potential towards sustainable business models that embrace and deeply internalize social responsibility. friedman told us that 'the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits', discarding environmental concerns as mere 'buzzwords'. this type of thinking characterizes the very core of our now globalized economy, and supposes that consumers will choose whatever is best that unhealthy business will be 'selected' away by the invisible hand, and that institutional wealth will trickle down and empower us with the ability to choose. this was a fine theory, and we've tested it, and we've invalidated it. we have the empirical evidence: unchecked capitalism dangerously tilts our incentive structures and mixes money with power, a deadly combination that results in the commoditization and destruction of our futures by inhuman, institutional need for self actualization at the expense of the human and ecological drive to self actualize. we've been warned about this toxic combination ben franklin thought and wrote about it, as did maslow, in his own way . so ok, we need to dissolve the combination of money and power in politics. politicians should be rewarded for their performance by the people they represent, not corporations. i believe we need to alter the fundamental nature of our politics. even a constitutional amendment that restricts campaign financing probably isn't enough given how many loopholes there are that get money from person a to person b without anyone knowing about it. we can't use politics alone to solve this problem, since our political apparatus has been deeply corrupted. so we need an alternative 'force' to counteract the institutional forces that have infected our social structures, not in some grand explicit conspiracy but in a layered, multidimensional manner that's tough to address or even think about without taking an utterly holistic approach. the only alternative, counteractive force that i can think of is a popular force from below but not one that revolves around some transient figurehead with charisma and some bright ideas. we need a permanent social fixture that transcends politics and brings people together constantly and increasingly around a shared desire for reasonable standards of living. ok, how do we do that? in the past, this is what the labor movement facilitated, with a focus on labor. unionization is what brought little pockets of working people together to exert economic pressure whenever some corporate injustice occurred. institutions can't exploit people if the people refuse to be exploited. people can refuse to be exploited if they coordinate their refusal around some educated, clearly articulated values and desires. unions themselves eventually became corrupted due to the business model that was necessary to support them. technology wasn't available to adequately meet the organizational and logistical demands of coordinating action among many people in the absence of some expensive bureaucracy. but that necessary bureaucracy itself eventually became corrupted from within and was externally attacked over time through institutionally funded pr campaigns, propaganda, etc , resulting in a popular ambivalence towards unions among the many who now believe them to be ineffective at best. but unionization coming together and refusing to feed the machine until the machine backs the fuck off, acknowledges its misbehavior, and addresses the sickness it's caused both socially and environmentally might be the only path to constructive systemic evolution. otherwise we're depending on traditional processes to yield untraditional results, which i refuse to trust. all of the technological progress in the world in the upper echelons of society won't mean shit if our populations are disintegrating from within. i see all of these sf and seattle guys laser focused on their worlds without realizing the extent of suffering that exists outside of their echo chambers. it's driving me nuts to think that if 1 of each discipline came together to develop socially motivated not profit motivated , integrative technical solutions we might actually be able to change the course of history through a form of universal unionization. we need popular economic leverage. we need a social organ that constricts when our institutions get out of line a procedure that can cause institutions more economic pain than the cost of complying with reasonable ecological and humanitarian standards. basically, we need collective nonviolent resistance and the civic tools to enable it at scale. think occupy, but rapid response, repeatable, sustainable, and highly organized. a permanent civic fixture that continuously recalibrates the incentive structures driving the sick behavior we see today away from mindless profit and towards forward thinking, sustainability, and spiritually healthy momentum. counting on giants like elon musk isn't enough we're all a little elon musk under the right conditions. imagine if that potential were to be actualized. imagine how quickly the world could change if there were a small army of musk like tinkerers engineering for what's right, but focused on civic tooling and not just stem ventures. this is where technology can be the great equalizer. my belief in the power of unity and in the power of new business models collectively owned business models is what wakes me up and drives me every day to try to facilitate this kind of concentrated power. i'm imagining a platform similar to reddit, but with an extended set of tools that focus on nonviolent resistance and apolitical organization. built by people today, for people tomorrow. there has to be a path to a better future, and i believe it has to come from unification and coordinated popular resistance. we need economic leverage, and i think technology can give it to us by shedding the skin of traditional labor unions and replacing that hierarchical bureaucracy with a collection of democratically designed civic tools. we need to make unions sexy again. change my view.",Politics is not the best way to solve many of the world's biggest problems.,joint-learning

' is kind of a valid mindset to me. the idea that someone can willingly escalate a problem to that level without being provoked, makes them worse than the person who reacted to the provocation in a similar way. and to the above thread i linked, you might say 'well she was provoked! the op messaged her and called her out on her hypocrisy over message! ' but that would imply that calling someone out over private message is the equivalent of publicly shaming them and mocking their personal issues. i think the point i'm getting at is that it's fair game to play equal in response to what someone else started. if someone wants to shit talk you over private message, you should be fully morally right for shit talking them back over private message. if someone decides to elevate the issue and make it public, then you're fully in the right to also take it public provided you're not stepping it up another notch. play shitty games, get shitty prizes. to me this mindset is the non political equivalent of 'enlightened centrism' things are the same where any bad action is treated as equa irl l, regardless of the context surrounding it. it's like calling someone 'just as bad' for being bigoted towards racists. in most of these situations there is one side starting or escalating shit with no good reason, and on the other side they are giving shit in response to the shitty actions. the side that is responding is on a morally superior high ground. cmv. amp; x200b;",Personal message shaming people on reddit should be legal because a person is publicly shaming you,pipeline-learning

525,t3_aort0u,"i come from victoria australia where restrictions on firearms stop people from owning any form of firearm without an extensive background check, and even then you can only own a bolt action or lever action firearm. i am not seeking the abolition of firearms, as they are ultimately tools with a purpose but i do not believe anyone would ever require a fast firing semi automatic ar 15 style rifle. i go hunting with my friends who are strong pro guns advocates, so i want to better understand their viewpoints, and it would be great if someone could cmv. i reject all common arguments against firearm ownership, and will attempt to outline my reasoning, before seeking opposition. statistically in the us, there is 1. 2 guns for every 1 person. with an average cost coming at around the 700 dollar mark, that is a huge burden on the economy being sunk into what is essentially an arms race. the justification for gun ownership is either touted as home defence, or defending civil liberties. in the event of home defence, having legalised firearms doesn't give the defender an advantage, it just means both parties now have firearms and more collateral damage is likely to ensue. in the case of defending freedom of speech, warfare has evolved, could your ragtag militia of riflemen fight off an armoured tank division? could you defend your liberties in the face of a drone strike? the reality is that more guns doesn't solve any problems, it just creates a costly arms race to the detriment of all. although australia has a comparatively smaller population, we have still not seen a mass shooting since restricting firearms almost 20 years ago. a common counterargument is to cite other nations that have extremely strict gun laws as evidence to it being cultural factors that cause mass casualties. while this is in part true, we do not live in one of these cultures, so we should seek to at least not enable mass shootings. australia is culturally very similar to the us, we are a smaller nation and have very little independent media, we are raised on a steady stream of hollywood movies and american talk shows. the key difference is the accessibility of a firearm, in most states as i understand it , the only prerequisite to purchasing a firearm is showing age verification. this process is too quick to deter potential rash action, it has no registration that could hold a criminal accountable. the australian process takes several months to acquire, requiring police verification, a safety tutorial as well as a safety examination. amp; x200b; another argument is that the source of gun violent is mental illness. the problem with mental illness is it is very hard to spot, and has a proclivity to develop later in life. for example somebody with depression may actively seek to hide their illness to be able to commit suicide, suicide by firearm is the most common method at 50. 5 . the best way to deter this, is through a non spontaneous means of purchasing, a long process that leaves gap for change of mind. the reason that suicide methods that are more sudden are common is because they don't leave space for a change in perspective. furthermore many people who aren't mentally ill will still wish to commit crime with them. many gang members or enraged yet otherwise normal people will purchase guns with the intent of murder without being 'mentally ill'. it is impossible to lump all gun deaths into the one bracket, and it is impossible to avoid these fatalities without comprehensive policy. amp; x200b; summarily my arguments come down to a combination of their ineffectiveness in defence, their costly nature and how unavoidable gun death is without active restriction. i'm not particularly proficient with the statistics floating around guns. so i am genuinely very open to being proven wrong. just want someone who can point out the failings in my logic and offer a viable alternative.",Bracketing firearms in the US will not solve any problems.,joint-learning

532,t3_cy46dl,"i was raised catholic and went to christian school for 12 years. eventually evidence convinced me that the abrahamic god probably doesn't exist. some would accuse me if being an agnostic, but i'd say i'm what richard dawkins refers to as a 'de facto atheist,' or one who believes there's a very low likelihood for the existence of a god. most, if not all, of my arguments are probably ones the layperson has heard, but i'm only trying to bring this question to the forefront, not radically revolutionize the landscape of this type of discussion. 1 the theories of abiogenesis are much more convincing to me than the creation story of the bible. nucleotides and polynucleotides form on their own in a lab when you mimic earth's early atmosphere also lipids and amino acids form on their own. theorizing how this process could have gone about naturally to create the first 'proto cell' is much more convincing to me than creationism. 2 evolution directly contradicts the creationist text. 3 i'm much more convinced of the big bang than creationism. believers in the abrahamic god often say science claims something came from nothing. realistically, big bang proponents assert that there was a singularity of all matter that exploded and remain agnostic on what took place before the big bang and where and how said matter originated. theists also invoke a supremely complicated creator god while offering no explanation as to how said god came to be sometimes using the copout of, 'god is eternal therefore he requires no creator. ' 4 the jealous and vindictive god of the bible resembles the state of humanity more than an all loving god. 5 the body is far from perfect we get sick, cancer, our eyesight fails, we're sometimes born with deformities, our dna is full of redundancy, et cetera. how could an all knowing god create us with such glaring mistakes? 6 i don't believe in free will, though that's a topic for another discussion. but not believing in free will, to me, throws out the notion of hell. for example, some people are 'evil' because they were beaten and abused, and even subjected to the genes of a psychopath, and for those reasons they commit terrible crimes. sure, we ought to detain anyone who's a threat to safety, but should they be subjected to eternal suffering? i don't think so. so there are people lucky enough to be born into a good hand, and others who are dealt a bad one, and one is more likely to go to heaven and the other to hell, respectively. that's justice? 7 there are thousands of gods, and i feel no compulsion to believe in any of them. i can't muster up faith that i don't have. 8 why would an all loving god allow the holocaust or other heinous events in history? why would a baby be born with an incurable disease? 'god works in mysterious ways' doesn't convince me. i'm not necessarily looking for rebuttals to my 8 points, but feel free to if you're so inclined.",God doesn't exist.,joint-learning

539,t3_d9r0v9,"note: 'truck' in this case refers to all vehicles defined as a light truck by cafe. this includes most suv and crossover models. more here: average fuel economy average fuel economy amp; x200b; for the sake of this post, i'm considering it completely irrefutable that that the earth has a finite tolerance for emissions and that it is imperative that we reduce such emissions. i will not entertain any counterpoint that climate change is a hoax. amp; x200b; i'm writing this from an american standpoint as right now as american automotive manufacturers are essentially stopping production of passenger cars in the interim before electric vehicles come into play, and imported models are incorporating numerous design flaws which compromise performance and reliability often by using very low displacement engines under high stress from aggressive turbocharging . much of this comes from cafe regulations, which i have linked a reference to above. the thing that grinds my gears about cafe is 1 the difference in standards between cars and 'light trucks' and 2 the way that light trucks are defined. i think this regulation encourages manufacturers to sell and develop less efficient vehicles. essentially, coupes and sedans and station wagons and hatchbacks all have very difficult standards to achieve, while suvs and crossovers and pickup trucks all have much easier regulations, and this is why we see manufacturers pushing crossovers so hard despite them being essentially lifted hatchbacks with bulkier body panels. that additional height and bulk can take a vehicle from being in violation to totally compliant because according to the law it suddenly becomes 'truck derived'. that's bullshit. amp; x200b; why do i have disdain for larger vehicles? it's not just the environmental impact, even though that's the source of regulation that's killing small cars. it's largely the fact that trucks suv crossovers are typically heavier and taller. here's why that's a problem: amp; x200b; 1. heavier vehicles put more stress on infrastructure, leading to more frequent repairs and maintenance which can all be quite costly. 2. heavier vehicles handle worse, leading to accidents that possibly could have been avoided with a lighter and more maneuverable vehicle. specifically, they can't change direction or stop as easily. 3. heavier vehicles have more devastating crashes, as there's simply more kinetic energy involved. this includes both the vehicle hitting a solid stationary object e. g. tree wall or another equivalent vehicle. however, the prospect of a small car hitting getting hit by a large truck encourages people to buy larger vehicles due to safety concerns. 4. heavier vehicles wear tires faster, leading to more people driving on unsafe tires due to negligence. this can be counteracted with different compounds, but that can reduce maneuverability and breaking even further. 5. taller vehicles also handle worse. specifically, taller vehicles are more likely to roll if required to swerve. 6. taller vehicles reduce visibility for other vehicles, leading to more people to seek taller vehicles and compounding the problem. 7. taller vehicles tend to have high bumpers. higher bumpers require smaller vehicles to have higher belt lines to reduce the chance of the collision occurring at window level. this reduces visibility in smaller cars, and encourages people to buy taller cars to increase visibility. 8. taller vehicles are likely to cause more harm to pedestrians in collisions, as the victim is much less likely to roll over the top of it. so, heavier taller vehicles are less safe in numerous regards, while also consuming more fuel and contributing more emissions. in return, they have better capability for off road use, and more towing capacity. with that in mind, i advocate restructuring of emissions regulations with additional financial penalties assessed as taxation for ownership of larger heavier vehicles. amp; x200b; 1. all passenger cars and light trucks should be grouped into the same category as personal vehicles. medium trucks ford f 350, ram 3500, silverado 3500 and larger are already defined separately and should stay separate. 2. businesses should be exempted, as long as the vehicle is being purchased for work use and registered to the company. this way, professionals that rely on trucks won't be impacted, just the people that use them as personal transportation. 3. annual registration should include taxes for vehicles that exceed certain bumper height weight displacement values. i'm thinking approximately 500 parameter year. vehicles with low annual mileage 3000 year should be exempt, as they aren't being driven regularly. 4. people that live in areas with unacceptably bad roads can apply for exemptions. these exemptions would be address based and forfeited upon moving. also, the state should fix the fucking roads. it should be noted that living in areas with frequent rain snow doesn't count as passenger cars with decent awd systems are more than capable. 5. people that need to haul a bunch of people or cargo should look into a station wagon or minivan. this change in regulation would essentially resurrect station wagons. station wagons and and minivans can often haul as much stuff or more compared with suvs; much of the difference in size is due to suspension and frame design. 6. people who own a boat or a horse or livestock or other assets that require a trailer and a vehicle to tow the trailer should either pay up or own a separate vehicle for daily driving so that they can seek the low annual mileage exemption. if they can't afford to do either, then they can't afford the boat horse livestock. if they aren't a valid part of somebody's profession, then they're a luxury and thus fair game. amp; x200b; i'm not wanting this thread to become a strict critique of the above policy, but rather to serve as a demonstration of how i think it should be applied. even if the details are altered, the basic gist is that people that actually need larger vehicles and enthusiasts willing to pay significantly for them should be able to keep their larger vehicles, while everyone else should drive smaller vehicles. for what it's worth, europe already taxes people based on engine displacement, although their implementation tends to target sports cars more than anything. tl;dr taller heavier vehicles are bad for the environment and less safe for other people, and i advocate taxing them to discourage people from driving them if they aren't strictly needed.",Automotive industry has outlived its usefulness as a viable vehicle form for long distances and should be replaced by a bigger car.,pipeline-learning

567,t3_d18mc5,"recently i've stumbled upon paper titled 'even if the fetus is not a person, abortion is immoral: the impairment argument' by perry hendricks, full text can be read here though i'll try to include all relevant details in this cmv . i've found it not very convincing and hence this post. note: i'm not interested in discussing other arguments regarding abortion. i'm only interested in exploring whether this one holds water. so, the basic argument goes like this: 1. it is immoral for a pregnant person to drink alcohol because the child will get fetal alcohol syndrome, which will limit their cognitive abilities. 2. if it is immoral to limit abilities contained in set x then it is immoral to limit abilities contained in the superset of x the impairment principle, tip . 3. abortion limits all abilities of an organism, which also includes cognitive abilities. 4. therefore abortion is also immoral. now i take an issue with the second step, that is tip. specifically, i think the objections raised in section 5. 2 are proper counter arguments to the generality of this principle. here i'm going to present both objections, explain why i don't find rationale dismissing them convincing and how similar rationale can be used to dismiss the principle in case of abortion. 5. 2. 1 animal torture and tip claim: it is okay to kill an animal, while it is not ok to torture an animal, so the tip does not hold in all cases. there are two rebuttals to this claim. first is that it's simply immoral to kill an animal and i agree that person holding this view wouldn't consider it a valid counter argument. the second rebuttal, however, is not convincing. namely, the objection is that torturing leads to significant animal suffering, while the other does so, but in a much lesser extent. note that this argument introduces another variable besides the abilities, namely, pain. this can be easily sidestepped by introducing anesthesia. for example, if we were to give chicken anesthesia and then cut off its wings, then i would argue that this method of obtaining chicken wings is immoral compared to simply killing a chicken and then cutting off its wings. it is so because the first method will kill the chicken anyway, but it also introduces an unnecessary period of negative experience to it. now if we introduce the pain variable to the abortion case, then it is also easy to argue dismissal of tip. while limiting abilities of a living child introduces negative psychological reaction to them during the duration of their life, this is not the case if the fetus is aborted since the pain experienced by it is either very short or even non existent if the brain didn't form. 5. 2. 2 lethal impairment and tip claim: there are cases where lethal impairment is not immoral, but non lethal impairment is, so the tip does not hold in all cases. the paper again introduces the second variable, that is, the valuable good and then focuses on a case of self defense. however, another example mentioned in the paper is not so clear in this manner, namely in the case of voluntary euthanasia. if i state to someone that i wish to be killed, then it may be moral for them to fulfill my request, but it is immoral for them to e. g. chop off my arms. this is not because killing me creates some valuable good, but because one thing i consented to, while not to the other. now in the case of abortion, the author has expected some attacks whether abortion creates valuable goods and responded to them in section 5. 3. 2. the main objection that i would raise is about the pregnant person's sacrifice. specifically bearing a child requires the person to suffer various side effects of pregnancy, limits their ability to work and function normally, and results in childbirth which is also a painful process. on the other hand, early abortions are comparable to a heavy period in terms of pain. the author equates these situations by stating 'to have an abortion is not to avoid suffering', which is an oversimplification, especially compared to his previous animal torture example, in which the amount of pain received was considered. this is why i don't find this paper convincing; change my view.","Water consumption and drinking alcohol are valid counterarguments to the ""Abortion is Immoral"" principle.",joint-learning

' indeed, in peer reviewed scientific publications on pubmed, all claims besides the ones that are stupid obvious and backed by countless studies are cited. that is to say, you don't have to cite shit like: 'ice is the solid phase of water' but you absolutely do need to cite shit like: 'cbd can help manage your anxiety' in fact, it can do that because it acts on the central bzd benzodiazepine receptors in your brain and also fucks with certain endocannabinoids like anandamide levels in the blood also the purported cause of it's analgesic effects . i'm not going to list my company here or any of my personal works, because i use this account for a lot of health related challenges i'm facing and appreciate the anonymity of it all. so this is an earnest argument stating that at the very least, all online content that makes health science claims should be cited in the clinical evidence. if that means you need to outsource your blog writing to someone like me i have my msc in biotech and am the author on 3 peer reviewed papers and 1 published abstract for ishlt and published in jhlt as lead author then you should, for the good of mankind, do that! more importantly, we the consumers and their audience should start questioning everything that doesn't have citations but makes bold claims. i for one am tired of the amount of bs i read online that really diminishes the value of mankinds greatest i'm sure this could be argued too but go ahead, i'm game invention: the internet! i think companies and individuals who engage in creating deceptive, seo optmized 'clickbait' are doing us all a huge disservice and seeking instant gratification. when you create resourceful and powerful online content that empowers your audience, you will bring in customers ideally you do have a good product service too we only work with brands we believe in and you absolutely deserve to make that money! i'm curious if anyone feels differently. if not, i propose starting a movement. next time you're reading about why x supplement, y diet or z drug is the best thing ever for your condition, demand that they offer proof! we should stop consuming content or at the least, don't let it result in a turnover and make the owner of that content money that doesn't provide any evidence for their claims. if we immediately looked for citations and at least glanced to verify these citations are from the ncbi database pubmed and not something like cosmo. com then online health content would be held to a higher standard. 90 of online health content would become obsolete. i mean people think they're learning 'science' from meme's for god sake! if all health based content from vaccines information i did a recent blog on how this study published that showed twitter bots and russian trolls have been amplifying the vaccine debate simply to cause discord and that some 50 of the antivaxx community is active on social media the two go together to manipulate and deceive beautifully to all the cannabis related content coming out now and hemp related content, would cite their damn sources, the world would be a better place for it. deception and lies never benefits the masses, only a selfish few. now, i understand its not easy to read abstracts and studies on pubmed and then distill it down to a blog post that is easy enough to read for the laymen without compromising the integrity of the information or being inaccurate. this is where the balance between art and science lies. that is what my company does in addition to pr services and i think there's a legitimate need for it. unsurprisingly, the majority of our clientele now are in the cannabis sphere and cbd industries. even starting as a freelance writer, things only took off because i was getting a lot of work through the cannabis industry. it's definitely one of the best examples of why i feel so strongly that the work i'm doing is necessary. i definitely didn't plan to go this route. i was pre med in college and after my ms, briefly in a phd program. but i've had a lot of challenges in life with physical mental health and life took many turns. i'm excited to be learning about stuff like seo optimization, how to pitch journalists on haro and the elements that get eyeballs on my work and my clients the attention they deserve. but it all starts with our fundamental purpose: to empower society through resourceful, educational content. use science to sell your shit and then go ahead and make that money. be thought leaders in your industry; experts! that's what we need more of. invest money into evidence based content marketing what i like to think of as the 3rd generation of marketing 1st being interruptive like pop ups and commercials, 2nd being inbound marketing which clickbait is slowly but surely killing and evidence based inbound marketing content marketing amp; pr which is what i feel we are pioneering . i work with creative writers, scientists, doctors and people who i feel can help lead this 'digital content revolution'. what do you guys think about this? to be a little more specific, i'm saying content that's related to science or health in any way should look like this and readers should demand this: 'cbd can help reduce anxiety and has anti inflammatory properties. 1 at the bottom of the blog in the works cited section works cited 1. anon et al. 2018 j. of whatever you get the idea i think this is how online health and science content should look. we should demand this. amp; x200b; thanks for reading. in clint eastwood voice go ahead and change my view ;","Doctor of Philosophy and pharmacist, the only reason I can claim success is because of media/social media and because I'm starting a medical/health consulting company that needs to be cited at the very least",pipeline-learning

life, and to fight it might be impossible there is a current trend to fend off the idea of totalization or totalitarianism: things should not totalize see it politically, be it either the general 'generic' leftist attitude that is obvious here or the also general 'generic' fear associated with the sentiment of the right leaning that the notion of progress is dangerous because it is, in a sense, a kind of totalization, a totalitarianism where the human is slowly losing out to the system, the systematization and automation of societal function it can also be seen by the point of view of the center, this one being generally the ones in between the extremes, afraid of totalizing their modes of life into concrete and stiff ideals cybernetically the machine is extending its appendages from a future yet to become: there is a notion of a singularity that already happened in a faraway future, and all of our history is merely a teleology to that point this is what is being fought against, if idiotic it is being shunned as incoherent, if somewhat sound, even if just amusing, it is being shunned as dangerous 'how do we get ourselves from this? rolls in the back of the head of many thinkers, almost all it is one of the themes or archetypes fueling thought right now but the thing is: is not the human, even just the human body, a singular human body, a totality in the sense that, even if it is ontologically open however you might want to interpret it , it is still a singularity of sorts, a whole 'society', a 'universe', that totalized into a body and then into a mind and then into a self how much can analogy break at this point, and how much does it ring interesting if totalization, the organization of systems to such an extremely complex point of efficiency that practically everything useful of the outside is assimilated and interiorized, is the very principle behind us, behind life and complex systems in general, how and why should we fight it why not just accept the ai overlords if to fight, why not to just accept a version of primitivism or mass suicide symbiogenesis is heavily accepted as part of evolution, in it the habitual positive interaction mutualism between two different organisms two different wholes , through vast periods of time, make one of those wholes assimilate the other as an 'organ' or both to merge together more evenly to form a bigger, more complex whole if this principle is somehow, in a much more complex version, applicable to larger scales, how can there be an escape of totalization if it is the very essence of interaction and evolution you yourself, a human body, even if devoid of your social place, imagined as just a biological organism, is an accretion of such a complex set of processes of assimilation, of endosymbiosis over endosymbiosis, of wholes capturing other wholes, growing a system more complex each second through aeons: each layer of your brain is a collaborator, not to say a slave, of the newer layer and what we understand as the fittest organisms are the ones who have more control over themselves, systems with the best synchronic functioning, made more cohesive through uniformity of action, that is, harmony lack of order is seen as a disease in any layer, be it individual, groupal, social an absence of harmony this harmony as general principle seems to be auto poetic, it self configurates and self adjusts, self evolves the more harmonic a system, the more efficient it will be and thus the less active and working it will need to be, it can conserve more energy this energy conserved is surplus that then can be redistributed and focused in creating new paths to explore, and this can be seen in any level or layer: this can be applied from mitochondrial symbiogenesis to an individual human in society and even to societies as wholes for example, agriculture and the ability to cultivate food made humans conserve energy and settle, not in need to constantly hunt and roam for food anymore, and this surplus made social evolution possible automation is merely habitual, just as our bodies were 'produced' in the case reproduced habitually programmed to function as a cohesive whole, our society grows automated and automates itself, like a superhuman body of which individual humans and groups become more and more like organs of, like mitochondria in a cell at this point analogy does break, things are not so simple but the shower thought remains, it does scratch something: are we just a mitochondria in its becoming we can finally see ourselves as mid way there, slowly captured inside a system that grows out of us and envelops us in the habit of doing what it needs to function did the mitochondria fight their way and miserably lost autonomy of the minor is sacrificed for the efficiency of the major it is not entropy in the sense of chaos that is to be feared, but harmony, the sense that if things are just left as they are they will always find a better more efficient way of doing whatever the status quo dictates through habit alone the destruction of humanity is contingent, it is possible and probable, but is not the evolution of humanity, or its assimilation, necessary and a certainty it can only be held off, it can only be contained through self conscious surplus dissipation: so we continue human we have to destroy ourselves just enough not
