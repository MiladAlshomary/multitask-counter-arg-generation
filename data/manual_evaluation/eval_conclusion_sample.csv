0,t3_ax6ij5,"i'd like to find some counter arguments because of the obvious racist implications. it seems they are two ways of using language, with differences that seem to go way beyond of what could be explained by culture. the characteristics are as follows. perhaps the more obvious is the use of tone. type a langauges don't use tone there are no words that differ only in tone and the use of tone is completely separate from the language itself. tone is only kept when the syllable complexity or phonologcal inventory are otherwise very large, and tends to be easily lost, have more the characteristics of different kinds of stress and is almost never really important for comprehension. in type b langauges, tone works in a way that is not really different from other phonemes. tones distinguish words from each other, and it isn't much harder to find words that differ in tones than it is to find words that differ in vowels. even languages with otherwise tiny phonemic inventories may have words that differ only in tones and the language may be near impossible to understand without tone. the important here is the biological factor. languages will change when adopted by the other group as it was the case with singaporean english or afrikaans , type a children will struggle with acquiring the segmental tones, while a type b child will fail to acquire the suprasegmental tone and may speak either with a flat voice or pronounce the words with idiosyncratic tones. the most improtant difference is how the langauge is used to communicate, and leads the two groups of people intuitively self segregate, as they make effective communication nearly impossible. type a speakers transmit primarily high level information. what inferences they made. type b speakers transmit primarily low level information. what was actually observed. this will make type b seem as if they are drowning the listener in unnecessary detail, that they trying to be 'poetic' or 'deep' for no reason or that they don't actually 'understand' the meaning of what they saying, and a type a person may not listen to what is being said or fail to make the necessary inferences. type a speaker will on the other hand be seen as too vague, perhaps even intentionally so and likely even unwilling to communicate clearly and hard to understand, as the low level information expected by the type b is lacking or missing entirely. second is how the language is used to communicate. type a people use a form of communication where false statements can imply truth and true statements may imply falsehoods. conversational implicature type b speakers only use this in very specific circumstances, or not at all, and trues statements can only imply true information and false statements are always interpreted as lies. the main point again here is that the difference is biological, type a children will spontaneously learn to use language in this 'creative' way while type b children will neither do that nor they naturally learn to interpret the communication of a people correctly. this of course leads both to perceive each other as persistently lying, and may be the cause of ethnic violence throughout history. there may even be some measurable neurological differences, as it seems that type a people only process language in their left hemisphere, while type b speakers use both hemispheres, so you would need to explain how can culture rewire the brain in such a dramatic fashion.", The language faculty of West Europeans is biologically different from those of non-West Europeans.,ground-truth

20,t3_aza2kk,"i am a firearms owner and supporter of the right for civilians to own small arms. i believe that most gun laws are an infringement on the second amendment and that private citizens should be allowed to own whatever arms they desire, short of nbc's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons . that's not the view that i am requesting be challenged. rather, i would like to hear opinions about the future of real world gun control legislation. i believe that a second assault weapons ban awb is inevitable in the next ten years. to me, it seems clear that the gop is losing their grip on power. to say nothing about the scandals of the trump presidency, they have already lost control of the house and might very well lose control of the senate in 2020. there is a strong possibility that the republicans will lose the presidential election in 2020 as well. we can assume that a democrat controlled congress will vote for an awb. there is a possibility that the president would veto such a bill, but every democratic candidate for presidential nomination so far has indicated that they are in favor of an awb. even if trump wins reelection in 2020, there is a good chance that he would sign an awb. he has a history of campaigning for gun control and he is notoriously fickle. if he feels that signing an awb would win him public favor or political capital, i have no doubt that he would be willing to turn his back on the second amendment advocates among his base; trump has screwed over his allies time and time again. there is also a rich history of republican presidents supporting gun control measures. nixon signed the gca of 1968, reagan signed the fopa of 1986, and george h. w. bush even indicated his willingness to renew the sun setting awb of 1994. the nra has also lost a tremendous amount of political capital and public goodwill in the past several years, due to poor management, adversarial public relations, scandals, and partisan politics. they were never a very powerful lobby to begin with their operating budget is small in comparison to other lobbyists and they are a shadow of their former selves. i doubt that the current nra could stall an awb or force political concessions. the only reason that we don't currently have an awb today is due to the sunset provision of that law, which was a necessary compromise to ensure its passage. i believe that any awb passed today would not require such a compromise, given the current political climate. i won't speculate on the ultimate fate of the second amendment although i fear that an awb would be a stepping stone to complete dismantling but i feel that a new awb, without any sunset provision, is inevitable. cmv.",Incumbent Republican President Donald Trump will sign a second assault weapons ban in the next 10 years.,joint-learning

30,t3_aliy7s,"let me be clear that when i say 'private property', i mean the private ownership of the means of production. i'm not referring to personal property your clothing, laptop, home, etc. private property is defined as 'a legal designation for the ownership of property by non governmental legal entities. ' in order for private property to exist, it has to be legally recognized by our government. more importantly, the government must maintain a monopoly on violence in order to enforce private property ownership. for libertarians who oppose state violence and the police, yet believe the government's one duty is to secure our constitutional right of private property, they run into a problem here. the police force literally was created during the industrial revolution solely to protect the private property interests of the wealthy elite and corporations. the only reason a single individual is even capable of owning vasts amounts of wealth and land is because of government enforcement. a single person would never be able to secure property and wealth across the country without government enforcement through the police and the court system protecting their interests. libertarians constantly define the wealthy elite's right to accumulate unlimited private property and single handedly control the means of production, but don't account for the fact that government monopoly on violence is required in order to keep this system in place. this is why many people who oppose private ownership of the means of production also oppose the government. the government primarily acts to protect private property interests, and not the welfare of workers. which is exactly what many libertarians argue for.", Libertarians who oppose state violence but dogmatically subscribe to a belief in the rights of private property are hypocritical.,ground-truth

40,t3_aqaldi,"i am a school board member, my wife is a teacher, but it is better to send my children to a private school. there has been a lot of public discourse about the standards of education in america's public school recently. the entire discussion is flawed, however, because no one really states the reality of public education: it has become a nanny for parents who cannot or choose not to take care of their children. this cmv is not to disparage public education in fact i am a school board member and my wife is a public school teacher obviously we support public education but it is judged on the outcomes that the school itself cannot control. to suggest our schools are failing is a lie. perhaps they are failing because children come to school hungry and cannot learn, or cold and do not have coats, or come with the mental trauma of domestic abuse. those are all real issues but should not be taken into consideration when judging a school 'good' or 'bad. ' the judgement should only come from students who meet a baseline where the actual academic curriculum can be absorbed. because public school have to cater to the broken and the hungry it takes away resources and time that could be devoted to academic curriculum. private schools, for the most part, have much fewer of these problems to deal with, so their curriculum is superior. it would be a mistake against my children to not send them to the best school for the academic growth.",Independent school systems are superior to public schools,joint-learning

50,t3_d6k4u5,"let me start this discussion with my premises. 1 a good constitution is concise. 2 a good constitution is specific 3 a good constitution is moral 4 a good constitution is functional 5 a good constitution follows the following definition: a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed. oxford dictionary discussion of these premises is encouraged but i think they re relatively stable as is. there are other more minor things as well that determine the quality of the constitution such as the literal grammar, the syntax layout, the tone, etc. that said i think it is time to start our conversation. 1 the constitution is concise. compared to many other constitutions of the world it is very effective in length. we can count word number or whatever but i think it is reasonable to say its length is reasonable. as a small hiccup the necessity for amendments to the constitution redacts from the conciseness of the document rendering this point more questionable. that begs the question of whether a constitution should require amendments. theoretically a good constitution allows for amendment but is strong enough on its own to function without them. realistically, the us constitution does not do this. the rights it provides are non specific, the legal aspects of it have been changed multiple times, and it is too ambiguous to function as a doctrine for the country. for this reason, it necessitates amendment, which detracts from the constitutions value as a concise document. 2 specificity in the constitution varies from very questionable in some parts to very good in others. when concerning legal issues such as the vote, the legislature, and the judicial system, the constitution is very specific and meticulous in describing the system. as mentioned before, though, the specificity in moral issues rights are non specific and thus require amendment. this makes the constitution a relatively neutral document in terms of specificity. 3 the constitution is morally ambiguous. the majority of rights are covered in the bill of rights or additional amendments. furthermore, the rights mentioned aren t tied to the judicial system. subsequent laws passed throughout the years have served that purpose. furthermore, on the note of democracy, the constitution is also ambiguous. assuming democracy is a good government style for its moral reasons then the electoral college, the inability for votes to contribute to law making besides contacting their senators , and the winner takes all political system are all indicative of flaws in the constitution. democracy, one of the fundamental moral ideas in the document, isn t well preserved. one may argue that the points i brought up aren t the responsibility of the constitution rather that they are the responsibility of subsequent laws. to this argument i say that democracy should be preserved entirely, as a right, in the constitution. this means it cannot be taken away nor can the government be unrepresentative of the population. this makes it entirely a constitutional issue and as the constitution fails to address it, it makes the nature of the document dubious. 4 the constitutional is not functional as reference material for subsequent laws legislative branch or the judicial system. if there is debate about the constitution it is not a good constitution. it should be absolutely clear in defining how the government should function and how citizens are protected by it. in the america a realistic judge cannot say you are arrested because you violated x, y, and z in the constitution. it doesn t provide the functional capability to organize the government specifically. nearly all the governments functionality comes from subsequent laws and amendments to the constitution. for this reason the constitution is essentially a topic of contention when realistically it should be absolute and people should agree upon it. 5 we are not governed by the constitution. that is likely the fundamental flaw of the constitution. i reiterate subsequent laws and the amendments are the defining factors in determine the behavior and consequences of behavior in the governed. not the constitution. for that reason, the constitution loosely fits the definition provided and thus is shaky as a constitution summary 1 the constitution isn t concise because of amendments 2 the constitution isn t specific. laws and amendments serve that purpose 3 the constitution isn t morally clear doesn t define rights well democracy isn t defined well 4 the constitution is not functional as reference material for the legal system 5 it loosely fits the definition of a constitution", The US Constitution is a good constitution and should not require amendments or amendments.,joint-learning-two-decoders

60,t3_bh3rw9,"it goes without saying that, at least in the united states, having more money means having access to better legal representation in criminal and civil court. although i do not know of any systematic studies that establish a correlation between the amount spent on legal services with the probability of a favorable outcome, it seems commonsensical and undeniable that there is some discrepancy between the quality of legal representation the wealthiest american receive and that of the poorest americans. for some, this state of affairs might seem fine, so long as the poorest americans have access to legal representation of some minimal level of quality, in the same way you might think it is okay for the wealthiest americans to purchase healthcare that his superior to some baseline level of care available to all americans. however, there is a crucial distinction between healthcare and legal representation. to see this, consider the right to vote, for the healthcare model of fairness seems totally inappropraite. it's not that everyone should get some minimum amount of influence one vote , but that wealthier americans should be allowed access to more many votes : rather, we expect everyone's level of influence on elections to be the same. it seems to me that the same should hold of legal representation. just as everyone should have the same level of influence in a democratic election, everyone should have the same level of influence in a legal proceeding to which they are a party; the probability that someone, say, is convicted for a crime, given a body of evidence, should be the same regardless of who is charged with the crime. the largest obstacle to realizing this state of affairs is, of course, implementing a fair and effective policy that doesn't end up becoming a bureaucratic nightmare. to ensure that the rich do not have superior legal representation, the government would have to enforce spending caps on legal services proportional to the nature of the tort or crime, in the same way some states set prices on drugs in addition to providing subsidies to anyone who cannot afford those services . but this question of implementation is independent of the question of justice; it seems obvious to me that the rich should not have access to better legal representation simply because they are rich, even if it is difficult to imagine a workable system in which they do not, in fact, have it. another common implementation objection to 'socialized' law is that it would greatly incentivize frivolous litigation by the poor by removing its cost. and it is probably true that, if the poor could effectively sue anybody for free, we would see a major spike in the overall amount of litigation. but a world in which both the poor and wealthy alike are overly litigious strikes me as far more preferable and just than a world in which only the rich are i. e. , the current state of affairs. another way of putting this is that whatever obstacles a society puts in place to reduce litigation should apply to the rich and poor alike.",Practice of law ought to be based on the way the money is spent/how much the poor get out of it.,pipeline-learning

80,t3_ac9f46,"pretty stoned, just thinking about humans, when the topic of pride came across my mind. i encounter prideful people all the time, both in real life and of course the internet. pride seems to be considered a virtue and a vice at the same time. pride goes beyond self acceptance. it is the assertion of your own identity onto others. telling others that you're proud of your child is basking in the glory of what you believe to be good parenting. telling others that you're proud of them is being happy that you can associate yourself with an individual that you deem worthy. pride by nature is self centered, which isn't a bad thing for humans. pride is a good incentive for competition and allows us to continue innovating the way we do. but then i thought, 'what about gay pride? ' why would a gay man be proud to be gay? it's simply how they were born and raised. they had no choice in being gay; they just are. of course, when a person used to say 'i'm proud to be gay', what they really mean is 'i'm proud to be brave', because there used to be a huge stigma against gay people. fortunately in 2018, gay pride is not as dangerous to those who are openly gay. people in san francisco do not need to worry about scrutiny for their annual pride parades, which means that at this point they're merely celebrating their sexuality. it doesn't seem to be an issue of pride anymore, but an issue of bragging rights essentially saying 'i am gay and i love to celebrate the fact that i can be gay' . it's a new type of pride; pride in one's tribe. with that in mind, i think that it is a meaningless type of pride, since being gay isn't an achievement. it is as meaningless as being proud to be born as an american, or being proud to be born white. with each pride parade, the 'pride community' also develops stereotypes on the basis that they are the loud minority of gay people. not all gay people are proud of being gay; they simply are gay and go on with their lives without needing a pride parade. as a result, gay people have been stereotyped as flamboyant, overly promiscuous party animals that do not fit the identity of every gay person. so, reddit. please change my view. should gay pride still be a thing in areas where the bravery component is a non issue? if so, why should gay pride still be a thing?","Human sexuality should be more respected, in regards to the number of places where there is no such thing as gay pride.",pipeline-learning

140,t3_buxyuj,"the current issue with capitalism is that it can be heavily abused. our standard of living in the us has declined significantly in the past 50 years. while older generations are living comfortably on their pensions, we cannot prosper as a nation if we lose focus of the younger generation, as they are literally the future of it. an apartment your father or grandfather rented in the 1960's now costs 2 to even 4 times as much, and that of course is with inflation factored in. a person could find a decent paying job fresh out of high school and have a decent standard of living from it. literally everyone in my family over 60 did just that. today, a person usually has to obtain either a 2 or 4 year degree and saddle themselves with upwards up 50,000 or more in debt. not only that, but salaries for certain positions such as a banker are now lower than they were in the 1960's. we allow owners or board members of highly exploitative corporations to insert themselves in positions of government, or heavily bribe future and current politicians to write law and policies than highly benefit them and exploit the worker. one of the reasons why people are paid so little and are exploited is due to the decline in unions. unions in themselves are a socialist concept. when walmart and amazon dominate commerce, we no longer have free market capitalism, because the game is constantly rigged in their favor. trying to start a competing company would be next to impossible, and even if you could, they would drive you out. walmart did this when they came to a town and drove out all the smaller businesses. that alone proves we truly do not have free market capitalism. now we already have socialism in the us, in fact we have had it for decades. social security, public roads, libraries and firefighters are socialist programs in the us. fdr even proposed a 'second bill of rights' in 1944 that would guarantee people a 'decent standard of living', 'medical care' and a 'good education'. these aren't bad concepts at all, and today people constantly criticize them as being 'socialism'. if socialism is improving the lives of many people, how can you be against that? doing so is inherently selfish and immoral in my opinion.","Health care, public schools, insurance, etc. are not socialism.",pipeline-learning

150,t3_csht95,"antifa is a terrorist organisation. i am well aware that this is not necessarily an unpopular opinion. i know, however, that many on reddit do not hold this view, and i would like to know why. for the sake of clarity, when i mention antifa , i am referencing any anti fascist groups proactively seeking physical confrontation with their perceived fascist adversaries the black bloc for example, would fall under this category. this is not a debate about freedom of speech, whether the far right is equally as violent, or even whether violence is sometimes justified in today s society. let s start by defining terrorism. encyclopedia britannica defines terrorism as the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective . more detailed definitions of terrorism according to multiple countries can be found here while each country s definition of terrorism differs slightly, the consensus is that terrorism must involve violent actions carried out to instill fear and insecurity, and to achieve a political goal. a few examples of antifa's capacity for violence: june, 2010, toronto black bloc members vandalize downtown toronto. june, 2016, sacramento anti fascist group by any means necessary bamn leads a counter protest against a white nationalist group. violence occurred and was not started by the white nationalists. january, 2017, washington hundreds of antifa members are arrested during trump's inauguration, charged with various violent acts. february, 2017, uc berkeley a mob of black block members, numbering in the hundreds, began violent protests against right wing speaker milo yiannopoulos, forcing him to cancel the events. there were clashes between the protesters and the police, and the damages to the university s infrastructure totals 100,000. november, 2016, montreal antifa militants assemble to shut down concert by a perceived racist metal band. violent clashes with the police occurred. april, 2017, portland the city s annual parade featuring the multnomah county republican party is cancelled after receiving violent threats. april, 2017, uc berkeley conservative commentator ann coulter had her speech cancelled for fear of violence by anti fascist members. july, 2017, hamburg protest of the g20 summit turns violent as the city is vandalized by anti capitalists and anti fascists. september, 2017, uc berkeley political commentator ben shapiro holds a speech in the university. over 600,000 is spent to ensure his safety. august, 2017, march, 2018, king's college london antifa members disrupt a free speech event organized by the university's libertarian society. march, 2019, barcelona hundreds of antifa members violently protest rally held by far right political party. may, 2019, montreal antifa members commit arson during costly may day protest. june, 2019, portland journalist andy ngo is violently attacked during an antifa rally. these kinds of violent actions committed by antifa members are very evidently directed towards their political opponents as to intimidate them, instill fear , and often forcing them to change the ways that they act. when violent tactics fail, antifa members resort to doxxing to 'expose' their opponents. antifa has been publicly condemned for its violent actions by nancy pelosi and earned the criticism of public intellectuals such as noam chomsky the violent nature of antifa evident. i do not believe that these acts of violence are committed by the majority of antifa members. however, it is clear that most antifa members support, or at least tolerate these displays of violence . antifa supports direct action this is not the statement made by select individuals. violence during protests is espoused by the organisation itself. unlike steven crowder, i genuinely look forward to having my view changed about all of this.","Political party representatives such as BLM, BLM, etc., are either violent, or they are essentially violent, and have the ability to cause violent disruptions.",pipeline-learning

160,t3_d7l8i1,"i saw a few posts about this but the wording in the op is so wooly that people seem to miss the point. let me have a crack at it. what we currently call gender dysphoria formerly gender identity disorder is pretty much universally present in those who identify as transgender. since the wikipedia page is most likely updated by those involved in the transgender rights movement, it is safe as a definition imo . gt; 'gender dysphoria gd is the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their gender identity identity and their sex assigned at birth assignment . people who experience gender dysphoria are typically transgender i'm going to skip over the argument regarding the difference between biological sex and gender , and get straight to the heart of the matter: a small minority of the human population, through no wrongdoing of their own, are born convinced that they are a man trapped in the body of a woman or vice versa. i am not born with this myself so i won't claim to understand how it feels, but i can imagine it must be horrible at the very beginning especially when they might say something along the lines of ' mom i'm a girl, why do i have a penis? ! ' can't even begin to formulate how people deal with this. the suicide rate among these people is extremely high compared to the national average and it's easy to understand why. nobody likes suicide and these people have done nothing wrong we should help them as much as we can. from what i can tell, there's currently no way to reverse this condition and even if there were, which one is wrong? did they get the wrong body by accident or the wrong brain by accident? so people have three options: 1 roll with it and live life as what they identify as ie biologically a man but live as a woman including having or not having surgery to change their bodies 2 try to suppress it completely and live a lie 3 roll with it in the sense of accepting that they are a woman in a man's body but not attempting to change their appearance in any way this one seems to be uncommon . main event here's our scenario. i'm working in a cafe and someone comes to the counter to order. and someone comes up to the counter. from initial inspection, this is a clearly man dressed in women's clothing with makeup on. knowing that cross dressers who identify as men exist, i have to make a split decision. i go for sir. they can correct me if they want to. me : 'afternoon, sir. what can i get you? ' customer : 'it's ma'am. i'll have an americano' me : 'i'm sorry ma'am, americano coming up' so from this exchange we've established that the customer identifies as a woman. i'm happy to use their preferred pronoun because it's no skin off my nose. doesn't affect my day in the slightest. what i want to argue here is that there are two levels: level 1 whether you believe that they believe they are a woman despite outwardly appearing to be a man level 2 whether you believe they are actually a woman to clear up any confusion i'm using 'actually a woman' to mean someone born biologically as a woman with all the trappings of being a woman functioning breasts, functioning vagina, corresponding bone structure, archetypal muscle density, body fat distribution. in practical terms, if you put such a person in front of 1000 people, most likely a 99 or more of them would say it's a woman if asked to pick between man and woman. i argue that it's ok to believe on level 1 but not on level 2. i think most people would agree with me but i sometimes see extreme viewpoints suggesting that i'm somehow 'transphobic' if i do not view as trans women as real women and therefore do not treat them as potential romantic interests. change my view or at least broaden my horizons !", We are not obliged to suspend our disbelief for the benefit of people with dysphoria (transgender),ground-truth

170,t3_d0ukev,"i would like to begin by saying i am both a moderate liberal and pro choice, that being said, it is my opinion that the left has failed to argue the abortion debate in a reasonable way. the main point i hear from most liberals and especially from, feminist and other women's rights activist, is that it is the choice of the woman whether or not she was just have an abortion, and while yes everyone deserves a right to their own body, the main idea of the abortion debate is that it's not your own body that you're controlling. like all political issues each side has dozens if not hundreds of different ideas on a subject but i realize that there are few large points which the left hands to argue. so i'm going to look at these ideas and examine them from the point of view of somebody who believes abortion is murder, and has yet to be convinced otherwise because the opposition has made no attempt. 'this is men legislating women's bodies' while yes the majority of people voting for these bills are men and the majority of people affected by these bills are women, this kind of argument doesn't make sense when dealing with the crime equivalent to murder. obviously we can all agree that murder is objectively wrong unless situations absolutely necessitate it. therefore it doesn't matter who's writing the laws. 'these bills go against my constitutional rights' again from the point of view of somebody who believes that abortion is murder your right to control your own body stops at the cost of somebody else's. therefore this argument does not stand. after all your rights in the constitution cannot interfere with somebody else's rights to life liberty and property. 'abortion is less expensive than raising a child' this is generally speaking correct however again somebody who believes abortion is homicide well obviously not condone murder to save money. 'rape victims incest' well yes, it is understandable why you would not want a rape victim or a person has committed incest to carry a child, this is a poor example because one, these two cases represent a minuscule fraction of total abortions and two again, these people would likely believe that abortion is murder and therefore would possibly prefer a woman carrying a child that she does not want because that is preferable to them than ending a life. to me the only argument that makes sense even in the context of abortion being murder is to save the life of another individual. or perhaps if a child has a illness that will cause them a short and painful life that that is understandable to perhaps save them from their misery i believe that abortion is not murder and that life begins after a fetus exits the womb, and i wish more people would try to communicate that idea instead of communicating side ideas that really don't work with the whole murder concept.",Abortion debate is not as good as the left thinks,pipeline-learning

200,t3_d5j9o8,"it took me quite a while to come to this conclusion and some of the arguments that i m gonna use to support my claim probably need to be discussed in an entirely different post, but i m gonna just hope that they re not too controversial. first of all, i d like to try summing up about what questions the abortion debate revolves around. how valuable is human life? what is considered a human? how important is bodily autonomy? how valuable is the life of a fetus? basically, first we have to ask ourselves, what qualities determine the value of a living being. i think that most would say that that s intelligence, self awareness, consciousness etc. basically everything that revolves around the mental capacity. if that weren t the measure we use, i d have a hard time thinking of one that doesn t make us humans as valuable as plants for example and i doubt that anyone thinks that we re just as much worth as a mere plant. so when do we consider something a human? in my opinion, conception is where human life begins, but that doesn t automatically make it valuable. since we evaluate value using mental capacity, and a cell does not have it yet, it s not as valuable as an adult for example. what could be considered as valuable though, is the potential to acquire said mental capacity. and now we re at the final question. what s worth more? the potential to acquire traits that we deem as fitting to evaluate the worth of life or the bodily autonomy of a being that has already acquired those traits. value. that s what i ve been talking about this whole time. what is more important? i think that the fallacy lies here. what makes life valuable? what makes death bad? wanna know why we humans perceive death as horrible? that s because during our evolution, the species that didn t have a will to live, simply died out. a random mutation is the sole reason we perceive death as bad. that obviously doesn t make death objectively bad. if, for example, during the course of evolution, due to absurd environmental circumstances, the being that evolved to become a human, were to only gain fertility by killing their parents, then humans today, would perceive killing their parents as totally moral, because those who didn t, simply died out. ideally, random mutations also give the being incredible joy at the thought of getting killed by their offspring, thus nullifying resistence. we find killing our parents horrible, but this species would find it wonderful. logically, these alternate humans, would deem people who didn t enjoy killing their parents as incredibly immoral and assume that they have a mental disease. to sum it up, morality is objective and human life isn t worth anything. therefore, everything is worth the same. this doesn t mean that pedophiles should go unpunished, because that implies that punishing would be bad, but since nothing is objectively bad, it doesn t matter. we humans can keep doing our thing based on our subjective moral system, because there s no real reason why we shouldn t. if my arguments were correct, then there is no right answer to the abortion debate, because bodily autonomy and the life of a fetus are worth nothing and we assess value to them based on the psychological traits that evolution randomly provided us.",Trait theory is faulty.,pipeline-learning

280,t3_aqnkid,"i see time and time again people stating that it's impossible to survive on minimum wage and that it needs to be higher so that people can live off of it. i have never heard a bigger load of horseshit in my entire life. the minimum wage in the united states varies based on the state, but if you work full time, the average amount of money you are going to be taking home at a minimum wage job is in the realm of 2,000 per month 24,000 per year . let's assume the only raises you ever get in your entire life are on par with inflation, you never gain any other source of income, and you are starting out flat broke with zero dollars in the bank. let's examine if it's possible to live off of that amount of money: first, we need basic living expenses: rent: the cost of an apartment varies greatly depending greatly on where you live. however, even if you live in an area with a high cost of living, you can mitigate your rent cost by living with a roommate or significant other. let's also assume that you want to live somewhere decent so that you don't have to deal with being in a complete shithole where you won't be happy, even though that is still an option available to you if all you want is a livable situation. all things considered, i think saying that you pay 900 per month in rent is more than a reasonable estimate. you could easily lower that if necessary, but let's be generous. utilities and other fixed expenses: water, power, phone, internet, your netflix subscription, everything you have to pay on a recurring basis at the end of the month. let's also assume you don't have a roommate to split these costs with. 200 per month is another liberal assumption in this case. food. it's definitely possible to feed yourself on a small budget of 100 per month, but maybe you like to eat out a lot or order a beer every now and then. let's call it 200 per month. daily living: things like laundry, cleaning supplies, pet food if you have a pet, etc. let's call this 50 per month debt insurance payments: i certainly hope you don't have any student debt if you plan on working minimum wage your entire life, but you probably have a car payment, renter's insurance, etc. to compensate for the fact that many of these costs eventually go away and you can always just take public transportation, i won't round up too much and just call it 300 per month. okay, that's a total of 1650 per month. that leaves 350 per month to either save or spend on non essentials, right? wrong, because we have to account for taxes. 24,000 per year puts you in the 12 marginal tax rate for 2019, but the first 9,525 of your income is taxed at only 10 . this means uncle sam is pocketing 2690 of your income every year 224 per month . however, depending on where you live, a few other kinds of taxes may be coming out of your paycheck, so let's round that up to 250 per month in taxes. so yes, you can live off of minimum wage. even using generous estimates of all your essential expenses and including things that are arguably non essential, that still leaves you with an extra 100 per month to spend to save and spend on non essentials. but wait, we're far from done. things are about to get a whole lot better thanks to a little something called qualified retirement accounts. every dollar that you contribute to a qualified retirement account is 100 tax deductible and grows 100 tax free, so let's say that instead of paying that 250 in taxes every month, you put that money into an ira. that's 3000 per year you're stowing away for retirement. let's say that you properly invest that money in a portfolio of mutual funds and etfs. the average rate of return for a moderately aggressive ira portfolio is 7 8 per year. it's actually been much higher than that the past decade, but let's use historical averages and round down to 7 per year. if you start working at age 18, you probably won't be filing your taxes separately for a few more years and you'll likely be more focused on building up an emergency savings fund rather than a retirement fund anyway, so let's say you take 5 years this is generous to build up your short term savings before you start contributing to the ira. you are now age 23, and let's say you want to retire at age 70. from age 23 to 70, we are looking at 47 years of contributing 3000 per year to an ira yielding 7 per year on average. plug that into a compound interest calculator, and we see that by working minimum wage your entire life and investing a small amount every month into a retirement account, you will retire with 1,056,810 of savings. not only is it possible to support yourself for your entire life on minimum wage, it is possible to retire a millionaire. and hell, that's assuming that you don't save that extra 100 per month and blow it on whatever the hell you want to. so why do so many people complain about not being able to get by on minimum wage? i'll tell you why: because they are completely irresponsible and absolutely dogshit with money. would this math work out if you decided it was a good idea to have 3 kids you can't support? no. would this math work out if you decided to spend 300 per month on drugs and alcohol? no. would this math work out if you're late to work for the 3rd time that week and get fired from mcdonalds? no. stop buying into these fucking sob stories of people whose own terrible decisions are resulting in them being flat broke. it is not the government's responsibility to deal with the consequences of you having children you cannot afford. it is not the government's responsibility to deal with the fact that you can't control your non essential spending. oh, and do you know what the funniest part of this entire discussion is? you don't have to work minimum fucking wage for your entire life in the first place! ! ! for fuck's sake, it has never been easier to learn a marketable skill. student loans for community college are easy as hell to get. trade school is an even cheaper and easier option. the internet exists: learn a skill through it. literal refugees are teaching themselves to code and getting great jobs that are in high demand. unemployment is nearing all time lows you lazy fucks; take some goddamn control of your life and go get a better job if minimum wage is so difficult for you to live on. there are several times more open positions than people to fill them right now; it isn't going to get any easier than it is right now. stop blaming society for all your problems, grow a backbone, and take some responsibility for you own choices, because if i hear 'it's impossible to live on minimum wage' one more goddamn time, my head is going to spontaneously combust. i believe that everybody has the opportunity to support themselves in this country, even those unwilling or unable to do anything with their lives other than work minimum wage their whole life; that's what makes america great. convince me otherwise.", Minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour in the U.S.,joint-learning-two-decoders

' there is a very negative light on even expressing remote support for israel, much the same as the censoring of anti soviet articles in britain before, during and after the second world war read george orwell's 1984 and animal farm the israel palestine conflict can really be boiled down to this simple analogy which i can already see being the point of debate : israel and palestine are two squabbling siblings, with the uk being their supervisor. they are fighting over a new toy the land they both lay historical cultural claims to and the uk promises it to the israelites succumbing to zionist influence post war in 1917 , to palestine to sharif hussein of mecca in 1915 and to the french in 1916 . this caused a rift in the previously harmonious there was some cultural clashes leading up to this moment in history, but relative harmony and set the roots for the modern conflict we know today. after the british left the palestinian mandate, the arab league together invaded the territory to remove all jews from the land and to give the palestinians their promised area. as history goes, the newly formed jewish state won, and begun to set up a military prowess with the help of america, of course in the region that exists to this day. i must note that at this point the world stage mostly supported the creation of israel as they were the underdogs in the region among other reasons, i. e. american influence current day israel has many problems, what with the settlement in palestine which i strongly oppose, it is a clear powergrab by the israeli government applying pressure on palestine to respond , the constant embargos and restrictions set upon the gaza strip some considered to be criminal and the heightened security around the border which i generally agree with, seeing the track record of border kidnappings and rocket fire . it was only very recently that the world stage shifted to palestine's side. my current view is that israel, who i must say has a lot to improve upon in terms of power and negotiations, should have a right to exist and govern their own state without control of the settlements . i do not oppose the plo, but rather suggest similar reforms in their system to prevent corruption and to improve hierarchal structure. i certainly oppose all terrorist organizations such as hamas and hezbollah, along with their main benefactor iran who's military actively to aim for civilian targets . there has been much bad press, and i know that i will get an enormous amount of hate in the comments, but as long as it is constructive criticism i have no issue with changes to my view. please be civil in the comments, i am only looking for a sophisticated discussion. the people of both states deserve actual peace and harmony amongst themselves, and i can see that the problem lies within the relationship between their respective governments .",State (polity) should be more open with Israel,pipeline-learning

450,t3_b8khko,"the short and simple is that i think the idea of being tried in front of a jury of your peers is not necessarily a good thing. i get what the sentiment was in setting up the system. the idea is that justice would be more equitable if your guilt were determined by the community. ideally if you got a good cross section of the community's socioeconomic, racial, and gender demographics you could have a fair trial. the problem is, how many of us lay men and women are knowledgeable about the justice system or the laws? how many of us are subject matter experts on things outside of our wheelhouse? if there is a malpractice trial, i certainly don't understand medicine or medical law as much as a professional. it seems like with our current system, we make it easy for lawyers to game the system. it is not about what is factual but rather who can make the best argument to manipulate the jury's emotions. now ideally, both counsel will try to focus on facts to sway the jury. but we all know that it goes beyond facts. the fate of someone is more at risk since we are creating a pool of less qualified people. we should have a system of professional jurors as many other nations have. people who are well trained on the law and different subject matters to make these choices. while there is certainly room for error with experts, the likelihood of error would be lower. surgeons for example don't get it right 100 of the time but their success rate is much higher than someone who isn't a surgeon.",Likelihood function (such as medical and financial) in the US should be based on a professional jury.,pipeline-learning

460,t3_ambi08,"after watching a few documentaries, specifically the hulu one about fyre festival, i have realised that the general population is extremely sensationalist. this applies to political affiliation as well. most people identify as republican or democrat which i believe represent two outer edges of the political spectrum but also where most of the population resides. evidenced by the distribution of political identification shown here, which is no longer a bell curve unfortunately, this leaves the moderate voice unheard which means the election is won by whoever can pull enough fringe moderates into their fold to make their support greater than the opposite plus the moderate. a valid argument is that you have to get 270 electoral votes here to win a presidential election, which is true, but then it goes to congress which is usually controlled by 2 of the major political parties. that leads to this, 'what happens if no presidential candidate gets 270 electoral votes? if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the house of representatives elects the president from the 3 presidential candidates who received the most electoral votes. each state delegation has one vote. the senate would elect the vice president from the 2 vice presidential candidates with the most electoral votes. each senator would cast one vote for vice president. if the house of representatives fails to elect a president by inauguration day, the vice president elect serves as acting president until the deadlock is resolved in the house. ' well, why not just have moderates elected to congress then? because representative elections are decided by a run off if they are a 3 way tie. this system always fucks the moderates who are usually less sensationalist, have enough understanding and education to see both sides, and are the minority of the general population. so, therefore democracy here ensures that a political system remains in flux because the scale only has to shift slightly to the left or right to ensure transition of power. this is a positive thing because it prevents a political party from holding power indefinitely. however, it stops any true progress because it holds the moderate hostage to the whims of the sensationalist masses. a possible solution is to have political party candidates that are more moderate that will draw support of moderates and extremists, but as the population gets more extreme because of clickbait and social media engineering that becomes unlikely as elections are won by the most stirred up sides. tldr: moderates are probably better equipped at making decisions that represent a middle ground for the entire population. but democracy in the usa is becoming too polarized leading to the minority ruling the majority. democracy in the usa as it stands right now can be redeemed by the fact that it allows the ruling minority to be replaced if they become too extreme.", The House of Representatives should elect the President of the United States from the 3,joint-learning-two-decoders
