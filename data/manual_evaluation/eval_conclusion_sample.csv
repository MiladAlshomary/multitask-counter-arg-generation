0,t3_aiwppt,"models of climate change predict, in the very near future, existential threats to humanity. in particular are weather effects that will drastically reduce food supplies and access to potable water. in the western hemisphere, it is obvious that this will be far more disastrous to those south of the us border where, even right now, access to food and water is a real issue for millions of people. while the proposed border wall may not be entirely justifiable in its ability to stop current illegal immigration and illicit transport of contraband, in the event of a massive migration, greater in scale by magnitudes than that seen in europe, a border wall will be absolutely necessary to stop the influx. now, one might argue that it is morally unjustifiable to turn away the starving masses, which is a nice sentiment. however, this sentiment fails at practicality: this country s own food supply will also be taxed and to let in millions will only ensure that even more people will starve together as opposed to some living and some dying. if one were to argue that we caused more pollution than they did, and so should not live whilst they die, then the rational answer is to go ahead and commit suicide now so that you will not contribute more pollution or reduce any more resources that you feel others have more right to possess. doing otherwise is only to make the moral judgement for others by removing their agency. would a person who claims that we don t deserve to live instead of these potential refugees feel justified to murder infants now? if not, then how could they argue that an arbitrary amount of time will serve to justify that same death for wrongs committed at the same time that the same person was an infant? or before they were even born since the worst of the pollution caused by the us was done between 40 to 70 years ago ? it is not justifiable because neither the infant nor the potential refugee had a part in the damage done. so, what is left to argue? in the event of a refugee crisis, will a wall stop more refugees than no wall? obviously it will. is the cost of constructing one now less than it will be in the future? yes, it is, and it would have been cheaper still had it been built 5, 10, or 20 years ago. the worst case scenario of building the wall now is that it would be totally ineffective at the stated purpose and it would cost the government money that would otherwise be earmarked off to some other pork barrel project. that is very little risk when considered against the future benefit that can be provided.",Pollution is not morally justified and building a border wall is the best way to stop the immigration crisis.,joint-learning

' except doing so would be tantamount to deception, as you are denying that person your hopefully thought out opinion. this might lead them to believe that their ideas are king among others when they just might not be. you are also potentially allowing them to continue having opinions that are not well thought out or researched. for example, let's say someone brings up a controversial issue. let's say that issue has to do with immigration, or gun control, or any other politically charged topic. the person bringing up the issue s is someone who is obviously uneducated on most of the topic he speaks of. if you are someone who is knowledgeable in the topic, would it not be detrimental to this figurative person to withhold the facts in relation to the topic? damaging to him, even? would it not be more beneficial for this figurative person to hear what you have to say, and thus go into future political discussions with accurate information and a more informed perspective? of course there are people out there who are firmly stuck in their stubborn ways and won't change them regardless of who says what, but again, i'm not talking about those people. tldr: honesty and argument is more useful in the long run than being polite while discussing controversial topics with the people around you. if someone is uneducated on an issue, it would be detrimental to them if you were to withhold the truth from them, furthering their idea that their opinion is without fault.",Accuracy and precision should be important in debates than being polite or not being a part of the discussion,pipeline-learning

42,t3_bxagsx,"there are 2 camps when it comes to the point of college; either college is meant to be a job training center or the point of college is to make people enlightened. if the purpose of college is enlightenment then why is gpa a thing ? why this is matter how many times a person fails a class if at the end of the day they eventually pass ? why are there deadlines then if the point is enlightenment and education? why should attendance matter if someone understands enough of the material to pass a course. why should someone who does well in a course be penalized for not attending if the purpose of university is education ? why can't i just turn an assignment in two months later ? i would have completed the same work as someone who turned it in earlier. if the point is education then this shouldn't matter. one might say it would put a burden on the professor as people would turn in all their work towards the end of the semester. but why should the professors have a deadline ? the people who value their education or want their grade earlier would turn it in early and the people who don't shouldn't complain if they have to wait a month after the semester ends to receive theirs if the purpose of college is education. however people will say these systems like gpa and deadlines exist to prepare people for a career in the future. a common argument i hear against making general education requirements optional is that the purpose of college is for education and not a job training center and that people who that should go to trade school instead. the opposition to making general education requirements optional is that they are supposed to make students well rounded, enlighten and educated and that is the purpose of college. t you can't have it both ways. either college is a job training center or it's purpose is to make individuals well rounded. my view is that college use whichever justification provides the most rigor. clearly university would be easier and less stressful if gpa wasn't a thing and deadlines weren't a thing but the universities justification for having them is jobs. college would also be easier for many people if they can just jump straight into their major required classes and not take any general educations classes because they would save money and the time spent taking a course that is is not directly related to their major could be used on something else;however this is commonly prohibited in several universities because all of a sudden 'college isn't there to prepare people for jobs it is to make them well rounded and educated. ' notice how in either of these scenarios the options that make college more difficult are favored. universities in the united states all across the board are in favor of maximizing the amount of stress students have by having deadlines and grading systems because they are good for jobs but then making school costlier and more time consuming by requiring general education requirements because the point of school is not jobs. it sounds to me like a contradiction and is used to justify inflicting more stress than necessary.", The point of university is to make a life more rigorous than necessary,ground-truth

91,t3_bp80uh,"okay, for starters, i am a average height, low weight skinny male. i feel that the idea of gun control is used as a bandaid mechanism. right now we have social problems that lead people to do radical harm to others. psychology, welfare, and just general social support at not at a place that can quickly solve the creation of those that are willing to cause radical harm via guns . because of this we use banning guns as a quick solution. i find this to be only partially fair. automatic guns i could get behind, but single fire guns shouldn't be banned imo. if i had to guess, briefly and only as a surface level analysis, i'd say that the people who are predominantly advocating for gun control are likely women. in america it is a pretty well known cultural rule that you do not hit women. that being said, there is also a fear of rape. i would say that the former overpowers the later in terms of sheer number. rape can largely be avoided on many fronts. women generally have rules they live by that are aimed at this purpose don't go out at night alone . guns would help this somewhat, but generally i would say rapists aren't just outright coming up to you. they are coming from behind or in essence, an area you can't see. rape done at parties or in relationships have little to do with threatening, but if they did i would imagine it would be helpful to have a gun. hell i feel overpowered, so a woman feeling overpowered is likely much more terrifying. but socially speaking, in public, women are not physically threatened. i primarily see guns as a means to stop intimidation. once a person is grabbing you, your chances of being able to use a gun likely go way down, especially for women who are generally easily overpowered. the reason i bring up the 'don't hit women' is because you fundamentally cannot threaten women physically. every single person in a room will turn on you immediately and label you a horrible person. for men though, this generally doesn't exist. nobody is standing up to defend you. in my experience, you're pretty much on your own. and when you feel physically threatened while being a small person, not only is it a blow to your pride ego selfworth, but it's also threatening and scary. just look at modern movies. they essentially have to nullify guns for the main characters because the fight would just end immediately. they use large characters that are impervious to bullets because they can use their large size to threaten people and get away with it. you have a gun? he might as well just be a squirrel strolling around. someone threatens you and you can utterly nullify all future threats 'you physically threaten me again and i'll shoot you dead out of self defense. this is judged negatively imo as a culture but i don't see why it should be. if you want to use size and strength and pain to threaten and silence me i don't see why i shouldn't be able to just up the anti and threaten their life. they won't be willing to risk that. automatic guns are unnecessary for nullifying a threat. i can get behind banning them. but all guns? i find that to be silly. guns were utterly revolutionary in changing power dynamics in society, and don't necessarily have to contribute to power of one individual over many bombs, automatic weapons .","Psychology, welfare, and general social support are not at a place that can quickly solve the creation of those that are willing to cause radical harm via guns.",joint-learning

119,t3_btyc4y,"introduction i've been paying a lot of attention to the us 2020 elections, and in particular some of the policies brought forward by the various candidates. two policies in particular that i think are worth examining in more detail are bernie sanders' federal jobs guarantee and andrew yang's ubi i think they are interesting in that they are two solutions to the same problem runaway capitalism but i ultimately think that of the two a universal basic income is the superior solution. i have been a fan of ubi for a while now not sure when i first heard of it, but i liked it since i did , so i admit to some pro ubi bias, and i disliked a job guarantee from the moment i heard of it, so i admit an anti jg bias. in the spirit of epistemic hygiene, i would lay out why i oppose a jobs guarantee, why i think a ubi is counterfactually better i would be light in my pro ubi section because of length , and what could convince me to change my mind. before we begin, i'd like you to take not of the fact that i said 'counterfactually better'. i am not claiming that the status quo is better than a jobs guarantee, but that a universal basic income program is better than a jobs guarantee. to defend a jobs guarantee, it's not sufficient to make the case that warts and all it's superior to the status quo, you must make the case that it's superior to a universal basic income. the world you'd be comparing a jobs guarantee to isn't the status quo but a world with universal basic income. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; why i oppose a federal jobs guarantee. a note on incentives before i lay the case for why i am opposed to a jobs guarantee, i would like to talk about my beliefs regarding incentives as they are central to why i oppose a universal basic income. a defense of these beliefs would be worth it's own post, so i wouldn't lay out the motivation for these beliefs, and would instead just lay out the beliefs themselves. i do not take these beliefs as axiomatic, so it is not fruitless to argue against them though i would prefer you didn't do that as the burden of evidence required for me to meaningfully change my mind on this is much higher , but your efforts would be better served attacking the arguments against a job guarantee directly. that said, these are my beliefs: most humans largely have the same preferences: most of us have the same basic needs: food, shelter, clothing and similar wants: higher status, happiness, happiness for our loved ones, etc. there's variation in specifics e. g different preferences in types of houses, but we do prefer houses generally . most problems in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. systematic bad behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise undesirable behaviour amongst members of the system. it's rarely as a result of personal moral failings of members of the system . as a corollary to the above, most successes in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. systematic good behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise desirable behaviour amongst members of the system. it's rarely as a result of personal moral uprightness of members of the system . from the above, i conclude that the best way to improve complex human systems is to change the extant incentives rather than to change the people involved either by replacement or modifying their utility function directly . if your plan requires people to be especially moral to be effective then it's a shite plan. the desired outcome s should occur even when the individuals involved have no moral personality idiosyncrasies, as a result of the incentives in place. amp;nbsp; the case against a jobs guarantee i am not a gainst a jobs guarantee because of the 'jobs' part, but largely because of the 'guarantee' part. assuming that the 'guarantee' implies that workers can't be fired excluding extraneous circumstances and there's strong job security, a jobs guarantee perverts the incentive structures. it decouples employee productivity from employee compensation, and removes any incentive employees have to be productive at their workplace. without an incentive to be productive, employees would be counterfactually much less productive than they would be under private employment. one could argue that employee productivity is already decoupled from employee compensation, but i would counter that while there isn't a very strong positive correlation between productivity and compensation, the two are largely still correlated. for example, higher productivity may lead to bonuses, promotions, raises, stock options or rise in company valuation for employees who have stock options , more benefits, etc. on the other hand, lower productivity may lead to no bonuses, less benefits, lowered wages, demotions, getting fired. the private sector generally tracks some measure of employee productivity, and it seems to factor into decision making. they are also incentivised to reward higher productivity and punish lower productivity so it's what you would expect. the above leads to a situation in which the average employee in a jobs guarantee program is less productive than a similarly compensated employee in the private sector. this makes the economy less efficient as a whole, and as each jobs guarantee employee is one less private sector employee there is a reduction in overall productivity. furthermore, there are allocative inefficiencies, as employees in jobs programs may not be matched to the most appropriate application of their skills granted this would also occur in the private sector, but a jobs guarantee would exacerbate it further depressing economic output. furthermore, employing several tens of millions of people a number that would only rise as accelerating technological advancement displaces more and more private sector employees has massive bureaucracy. a lot of resources would be expended merely administering all the workers. this giant bureaucracy would likely incentivise systematic inefficiency and lead to even more resource waste. to make matters worse, workers admitted into a jobs guarantee program may find it exceedingly difficult to transition to the private sector federal employees already find transitioning to the private sector difficult, but a jobs guarantee may make this worse due to skill atrophy as a result of the lowered productivity . this creates a class of workers dependent on the government for sustenance. this would make ending the jobs guarantee program difficult in the future as it would lead to significant hardship for tens of millions of people and entrenches the inefficiency. ultimately, this reduces the jobs guarantee program to workfare welfare with a work requirement, like the victorian workhouses . we are left with a ginormous bureaucracy that is woefully inefficient and wastes both the government's resources and workers. to top it all off, workers in a jobs guarantee program are out of luck if they dislike their assigned jobs. however, as they'e dependent on it, they're unlikely to quit. as the dependent population would only continue to grow as more and more people are displaced from the workforce all the above problems would become progressively worse. amp;nbsp; the case for a jobs guarantee the main advantages of a jobs guarantee i see are: 1. cost: it would be less expensive than a universal basic income program. 2. labour: the government gains access to a steady and reliable labour force for various projects like infrastructure development, climate change, etc. the first is a point in a jobs guarantee's favour though it would grow faster than a ubi as each displaced private sector worker is one more jobs guarantee worker . as for the second, a normal jobs program without the guarantee part seems superior all the advantages without many of the disadvantages . as i said before, i am not opposed to jobs programs. ultimately it seems to me that the only advantage of a jobs guarantee over a universal basic income is cost, and i think the benefits of ubi and the disadvantages of a jobs guarantee tip the scale in ubi's favour. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; why i support universal basic income there are many reasons to support universal basic income b 7630162 on its own or as an alternative to a jobs guarantee and i don't really want to rehash here what you can read elsewhere, so i just linked them above, and below i'll formulate the arguments most relevant to me. the ssc article goes into more detail about this if you read only one link above, read that one , but a ubi helps many classes of people that a jobs guarantee does not: disabled, caretakers, parents in my case against a jobs guarantee, i mentioned that a jobs guarantee would likely lead to a reduction in economic output. ubi does the exact opposite. by putting money directly into the hands of everyone, ubi acts as a massive financial stimulus to the economy. most of the people who receive ubi would spend a lot of their extra income, and that money would go to others who would also spend some of the money, so the fiscal multiplier would be high. the increased money in circulation would likely result in a significant increase in economic ouftput. a study by the roosevelt institute on 1,000 mo predicted a permanent 12. 5 rise in gdp after 8 years. furthermore, ubi is likely to increase productivity not only compared to a jobs guarantee world, but also compared to the current one. ubi gives workers financial independence. no longer dependent on their employers government and private sector alike for sustenance they are are free to identify the jobs best suited to their particular skillsets. milton friedman said: 'no one spends another's money as wisely as he spends his own', as a corollary to that i would say: 'no one spends another's labour as wisely as they spend their own'. the financial independence provided by a ubi would drastically reduce the allocative efficiencies that would exist under a jobs guarantee program, and under the current system. this could result in a substantial increase in productivity. this in particular is one of the things that most excites me about a ubi. administering a ubi has relatively very little bureaucracy involved, and much lower administrative costs. so there would be less wastage of resources labour, capital, etc in maintaining a ubi program. admittedly, the monetary cost due to inefficiency in a jobs guarantee program would be offset by the greater expenses in a ubi program, but a ubi also does more, and the administrative workers maintaining the bureaucracy would be free to do more productive work. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; how to change my mind i admittedly haven't done much research into jobs guarantees, so i expect that there are things i am wrong on, misunderstanding or whose impact i'm incorrectly estimating. i think it would be easier to shift my mind on a jobs guarantee than on ubi not as much as for incentives, but i am pretty firmly in the pro ubi camp and the burden of evidence required to change that is pretty high so i'll focus on that in this section. i'll be more favourable towards a jobs guarantee if: the 'guarantee' is softer than i believe, and compensation isn't completely decoupled from productivity. there are other incentive structures that i am not aware of in place to maintain productivity. the us government is competent at administering tens of millions of workers, and the bureaucracy involved in administering jobs guarantee workers grows sufficiently sublinearly with the number of workers. the resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than i currently believe. a jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a ubi besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour. amp;nbsp;

'have you forgotten the brave men and women who have risked their lives yadda yadda. ' never mind things weren't any better a few years ago when his party was in power. when someone says 'what about the veterans? ' i usually just think ' what about them? ' they sign contracts, have a court enforce them. of course that doesn't work if the things they need aren't in the contract or if they're too screwed up and sick to wage a legal battle. from a government's point of view a veteran is just someone who is going to cost money while no longer doing anything useful for them other than as political sob stories to slap the ruling party with . of course they're going to try and go cheap. why wouldn't they? appealing to honour? that's how veterans end up pawns in elections shaking their little tin cups. rather than signing individual service contracts there should be a collective agreement spelling out pay and benefits based on whatever criteria is relevant rank, experience, etc , as well as formulas for bonuses, stipends, over time, etc. it will also very importantly spell out what the government needs to provide in terms of veteran care be it medical, pensions, or whatever makes sense. the union will then have the resources and expertise available to enforce it in court. benefits: better deals for individuals: go to a forum where people ask questions about joining the military and the most common advice from vets is 'get it in writing' because recruiters promise the moon but rarely deliver. even if you do get it in writing this recruiter is a salesman who spends all day everyday negotiating these contracts. a teenager doesn't have the leverage or the skill to get a good deal from him. better to use a professional negotiator. better deals for groups: is your government not providing very good care? is there something lacking? a single enlistee cannot ask for better va hospital coverage but a union bargaining for the whole can make it a demand in the next contract, they have insider knowledge of what is needed, and they have the resources to follow up. safer working conditions: the need for this may vary a lot from country to country but most military work is very mundane and comparable to civilian work in industrial or office conditions. hazardous chemicals need to be labelled and eye wash stations provided, etc etc. dignity for veterans. no longer will they be cabin boys for political parties in the hope of just compensation. city governments don't take challenging the police union lightly and the military should have the same respect. arguments that i will not find persuasive: arguments that misunderstand what unions are and how they work. an army union isn't a scheme to turn the order upside down making privates generals. it doesn't mean there will be strikes in the middle of battles. there won't be votes on missions. it means that when it comes down to compensation both the sides will negotiate on equal footing and if the contract is breached there will be a pool of independent experts working on behalf of union members to make it right. i realize there are veteran associations, they do not have the standing of a union capable of negotiating a binding collective agreement. if soldiers and veterans are able to negotiate equitable contracts it will make the military too expensive! i don't see the cost of money given directly to personnel as a problem. it gets spent almost right away in education, housing, sweet trucks, starting a business, etc. the army gets a happy soldier and the money gets shot right back into the economy.", The military should be unionized.,ground-truth

133,t3_as6y90,"so the jussie smollet case turned out to be a massive hoax, but to me, more importantly, it shows a new and baffling kind of behavior from those on the political left these days: a tendency to fabricate hate crimes, and a gullibility and utter lack of critical thinking and or a willingness to easily believe anything that validates one's worldview. the crime described by smollet was shocking: a couple of maga hat wearing, crazed lunatics roaming downtown chicago at 2 am, ready to throw a noose and bleach around the neck of a gay black tv star, and beat him. this is a violent hate crime . i've lived in a lot of places in america and never heard of a violent hate crime happening on the local tv news or newspaper. according to the fbi in 2017 there were 788 incidents of hate crimes that were classified 'aggravated assault' along with 23 rapes and 12 murders. first of all, we should be happy that we live in a modern society where there are only 12 murders and 23 rapes that have the backdrop of hate behind them yes, ideally it would be zero, but we are far from a utopia and this relatively small number of capital hate crimes for a country of 320 million is not bad. i would consider these to be 'violent hate crimes', because there was physical violence involved. there were also 1433 cases of 'simple assault', which is defined as, 'an attempt to do a serious bodily harm to another person, or actually committing an act to put another in fear of serious bodily injury. the definition of the term varies from state to state. simple assault is usually classified as a misdemeanor'. this seems to cover threats, insults, and other non violent but aggressive actions. i therefore did not include them since it's not a violent hate crime, as described by smollet. i would be curious about the details of these crimes too, but i don't have that information. so i was surprised that there were even this many instances of violent hate crime happening in the u. s. in 2017. my first question is, why haven't i heard about these crimes? you figure whenever an actual violent hate crime is reported in the community, you'll hear about it. then i realized how many verified instances of 'hoax hate' there are in america. there's a website called which keeps a running tally of instances of hate crime reports that turn out to be proven false. this is surprising to me. it got me thinking: why is there a seeming silence of the at least 800 or so incidents of violent hate crimes that happen in america, yet there are so many people who are fabricating hate crimes? it also kind of begs the question. if there are so many hate crimes happening in america, why do people feel the need to fabricate hate crimes? one response i can imagine people reading this will have is, 'how can you say hoax hate crimes are a bigger problem when there are hundreds of hate crimes listed right there in the fbi report? ' well this is where i could use some help and data to change my view. the way the law works, the police have to assume that a victim is telling the truth. this is what happened with the jussie smollet case. the problem is that i think a lot of these crimes are not proven one way or the other, they're left unsolved. so while it's possible that these reported instances of hate driven aggravated assault happened, i think a lot of them, maybe even most of them, are left unsolved due to lack of evidence or whatever else. given these hundreds of proven false hate crimes, and this most recent high profile hoax hate incident with jussie smollet, i'm wondering how many of these unsolved hate crime cases are hoaxes as well. if you can show me a list of the hate crimes that happen in america that were followed up by police with information that shows beyond a reasonable doubt that these crimes actually happened and actually were violent and hateful, that would change my view . anything that would show beyond a reasonable doubt that these hundreds of hate driven cases of aggravated assault happened would change my view. so i guess my main question is, if there are so many violent hate crimes happening each year in the u. s. , why aren't we hearing about them on national news? the jussie smollet case has been all over the news for weeks. is it just because he's a celebrity? are these violent hate crimes being reported on local news? is there any way i can read about them in detail without asking for a public records request from the precinct where it happened? i tried digging some more and found this article: this article left me with more questions is it really the fault of police agencies for not collecting hate crime stats properly? gt; the evidence suggests that many police agencies across the country are not working very hard to count hate crimes. thousands of them opt not to participate in the fbi s hate crime program at all. among the 15,000 that do, some 88 percent reported they had no hate crimes. according to federal records, the huntsville police department has never reported a hate crime. gt; 88 of police agencies reported that they had no hate crimes whoa! that seems like an important fact. does this mean all of the hate crimes in the u. s. happen in only 12 of police precincts? there was also this bit: gt; the omaha police department does not feel comfortable providing the numbers since they are concerned about their accuracy, in den bosch said, adding that it was difficult to identify hate crimes properly and that the employees entrusted to do so had done a job the department was now leery of. 'concerned about their accuracy' this begs the question of what strict criteria defines a hate crime. again, i harken back to the idea that many of these reported crimes are unsolved, and possibly fabricated due to lack of evidence. if someone claims a hate crime without evidence, should we just count it as a hate crime anyway? or if someone says they got in a fight with someone, maybe a drunken barfight, and in an attempt to make the other person look bad, they claim they used a racial slur? is this a hate crime too, even without evidence or other people to reaffirm this happened? i think there are a lot of problems with racial tensions in society, and a hard polarization between the right and left which has driven many people on the left into pathological behavior, like fabricating hate crimes to affirm their worldview. the knowledge that people can make absurd claims about being the victim of a hate crime without any healthy level of skepticism from those who agree with their politics is very disturbing to me. i'm not convinced that this is a problem with documenting hate crimes, and i'm not convinced that the hate crimes reported by the fbi are all that convincing. so, change my view.","Lawrence Smith's case shows a new and baffling kind of behavior from those on the political left these days: a tendency to fabricate hate crimes, and a gullibility and utter lack of critical thinking and or a willingness to easily believe anything that validates one's worldview.",joint-learning

259,t3_aumpn6,"queer means weird. it was originally a slur towards gay people so some used that term as something to be proud of, 'we're here and we're queer' as in 'we may be different but that's okay'. the brave gays back then did not identify as queer, they were just openly gay. now that it is totally acceptable and not weird to be gay, the term 'queer' no longer works as a slur or a synonym for gay. in fact, our society has developed more definitions and identity groups for gay people: the 'lgbt community'. let's break that down. l and g stand for lesbian and gay. that's self explanatory, could've just said gay, and there is nothing wrong with same sex relationships as long as they are functional and healthy. love is love. the next letter is b which stands for bisexual, as in a person who is attracted to both men and women. it does not really merit a separate group identity imo, it's more of a term for someone who is interested in a same sex relationship. there cannot be a functional, healthy 'bisexual relationship' because a romantic relationship requires exactly two people. whatever. the t stands for ' trans ' and that is a completely different thing. i wonder what's the point of this whole acronym? young people who think they may be trans are most likely just gay. old people who are trans can do what they want. who cares? it wouldn't even matter if anyone did, as they're not abusing children or attacking freedom of speech. next comes the q in the main stream media's gay sandwich. it comes after lesbian, gay, bisexual and even trans, if you are not any of those things that what are you? what is weird when it's completely acceptable to change your gender? i am literally asking this question. what does 'queer' mean in 2019? because if it's separate from gay than i am forced to return to its original definition of strange and or different."," The term ""queer"" is no longer a slur towards gay people, but",joint-learning-two-decoders

'we got to try' yea, of course, if there weren't 1000 other global issues that needs just as much funding and research. but nope, climate change is all the rage these days and we feel good standing up for that despite having no knowledge on the complexities of the issues surely global starvation is just as important as climate change? easy to say global warming is the bigger issue sitting on your bed watching netflix but tell that to people starving around the world so how can you be confident, that investing into these policies is the right move on a higher resolution plane of thinking. is it the right move? does it take priority? how does it fit with trying to make the best possible move to best serve our planet? i guess it's almost impossible to answer that but i believe it can be done by combining the top scientists, engineers, economists and statisians around the world and letting them get to work without politics driving them. and guess what, climate change might not be their number 1 priority. or looking at the problem from the bottom up rather than top down might be the best way? ? maybe investing in getting the world out of poverty is the precursor to combating climate change in the most effective manner and that might mean climate change has to take a back seat for awhile. this seems very reasonable to me if you take a step back and do your best to drop your biases and rationalizations impossible but we can try . but if someone were to suggest that certain economists already have , there would be outrage and the media would eat it up the point is, the systems of the world are complicated. and i mean that. you're 12. you don't know what you are even protesting. even the average adult is way in over their heads. the best thing to do is to invest in yourself. research, study and become competent to the point where you can have real impact on the world. change my view",Science is becoming too politicized and we need to do more to stop it.,joint-learning

294,t3_cva7iu,"i made a post similar to this a week or so ago, that didn t go over well. so i decided to repackage it to better present my argument. rather than stating incels should been recognized as a hate group by the federal government, i will instead argue that incels as a cultural subgroup are a hate group similar to that of the kkk and neo nazis. from my original post: incels, or involuntary celibacy see r inceltears , refers to a subgroup of people who believe that their genes have left then so unattractive that they are unable to find a partner, and thus have sex. these people spend time on forums where they seemingly brew and feed into each other s misery. many think of themselves as supreme gentleman who are nice people to women, and that it is the chads of the world this quasi mystical idea of a masculine male who gets all the women in the world who are partially to blame. but the buck doesn t stop at chad. no no, women are to blame too, you see. the stacey s of the would ride the carousel of chad around and go for asshole men instead of these nice guys . so why should a bunch of disgruntled virgins be labeled a hate group? for the simple fact that many have advocated or carried out violent attacks in society. elliot rodger was among the first to do this. killing his roommates and several other people because he couldn t get laid despite being the supreme gentleman . in canada, some incel rammer a van into a crowd of people for similar reasons. that is, being pissed off they can t get laid or get a girlfriend. more recently was the bagel shop guy, a short man who lost his temper over a perceived slight at his shortness. he didn t get violent, but he did become angry to the point of possibly violence. in addition, the community itself is a breeding ground for misogyny, racism, transphobia, and homophobia. some in the community actively promote or apologize ideals of pedophillia, hebophilla, as well as supporting legal rape or being rape apologists. acts of self harm, such as suicide, are also discussed. you can go to r inceltears to see more of what i am talking about. all in all, they are a breeding ground of hate, hate which does occasionally turn violent. it s not like other internet communities where someone might be on the outskirts of a group promoting such ideas. but incels actively hone violent and disgusting ideas. and for this reason, they should be recognized by the federal government as a hate group. now i would like to address and potentially nullify some counterarguments. incels aren t a singular group. therefore they can t be considered a hate group . many people argued this last time, stating that because incels aren t an official organization, they cannot be classified as a hate group. here s the thing though, white nationalists are organized in a scattered fashion like incels and are generally considered a hate group. incels gather in specific forums built and run by incels. they discuss incel related topics and identify themselves as incels under a single banner. i fail to see how that doesn t make then a recognized group. they label and view themselves as a community, meaning by their own volition, they are an organization community. elliot rodger and alex minassian were just two outlier instances. incels aren t typically violent or hateful . those two instances left over a dozen people hurt or dead. and for those who think the number matters, how many instances would it take to convince you otherwise? like, how many attacks do their have to be before you admit that there are hateful incels? furthermore, you are wrong about there being only two incide . r incelstears is a biased sou ce. you aren t reading what incels actually wr te. they aren t hateful or violent so inceltears is biased, but so w at? they aren t manipulating or distorting the content they publ sh. they literally post screenshots of what incels wr te. here is a link to a post i made there of an incel comic seemingly justifying r . second, i think it is disingenuous to claim there isn t a widespread hate and violence problem in the incel community, as there is. how do i know t is? the sub r incels was banned a year or so go. an entire sub with thousands of people got banned by this s te. you might claim that was some coordinated attack by reddit against incels, but the admins had good reason to get rid of . the current incels sub that took its place is under quarant ne. so once again, a large community of thousands of incels subject to moderation has been detai ed. seems to me like this is evidence of hateful activity, especially given what r inceltears has given us glimpses of dozens of unique posts are shown there each day, so it isn t just a small handful of people eith . finally, i will not be addressing arguments related to the first amendment , free speech, and hate speech laws as this is largely irrelevant to my main po nt. even if the things incels say are protected under law, it doesn t mean it isn t hateful or viol . and because my post was reported last time, accusing me of being unwilling to change my mind, i will say i am willing to do so. but a good, well reasoned argument with evidence must be presented to", Incels are a hate group,ground-truth

329,t3_bfliyf,"here is why i believe this. women are different than men. it s extremely easy for a women to have sex with a man. she just has to ask. it s a lot of work for a man to have sex with a woman that involves jumping through many hoops. because of this huge advantage women have over men it s the men that have far more to lose in dating and relationships. another factor is how women get attention from the opposite gender so much easier then men. it s evidenced on social media where women can get hundreds of responses from a single post but men at best might get a few. then you have the etiquette factor where women are immune from ever being rejected because society says men have to approach the women. the man is extremely vulnerable in these situations. if the women doesn t like him she can humiliate him through rejection. to make matters worse many women unjustifiably use the word creepy to describe men who they are unattracted to for hitting on them. then you have women s expectations of men which are far more unrealistic than men s expectations of women. women want a guy who s handsome, great communicator, in great shape, rich, and somehow is beta male level sensitive and open minded and a alpha bad boy at the same time. most guys just want a pretty, friendly girl who is loyal. but most women these days seem to want cuckold relationships where they are free to sexually experiment outside of the relationship while their man is expected to not stray. given how much more difficult it is for men in the dating game or the sex arena than it is for women slut shaming is justified. there is nothing wrong with men who get turned off by women who post dozens of selfies a day on social media, or women who dress in sexy clothes like short shorts where the ass cheeks are visible or tops where people can see your belly and cleavage. it s not wrong for men to not want anything to do with women who go to night clubs or bars. nothing wrong with not liking women who have a history of having threesomes or other crazy alternative sexual lifestyles. women invented being picky so they shouldn t get mad when guys take their advice. i wanted to add i mean slut shaming not in terms of verbally abuse random women in the street but by boycotting women who act like sluts. i believe men need to stop rewarding women s manipulative and toxic behaviors.",Social media is ruining women’s dating and relationships.

343,t3_c00rl9,"i just do not understand the hype behind botw. it was not a bad game by any means, but the story was very shallow, my of the open world is either empty, or filled with the same lame repetitive korok or shrine. all the weapons, despite looking different are basically the same variant of 3 weapons with different stats. there are no reasons to explore except for the aforementioned korok and shrine, no secrets meanwhile, in ww, the story is probably the best of the franchise. while the story is mostly linear, there are also many opportunity to explore the map freely, and take fragments at your own pace and path. every item you get has a purpose and feels unique, and you actually need to collect rupees. every tile of the map has a point of interest, and little repetitiveness. i believe botw got that much attention because it was the first open world experience of a new generation of gamers, as well as more casual gamers introduced by the switch. i can name many games with better open worlds: dark souls, dying light, fallout nv 3, subnautica, terraria 2d open world if you ask me , witcher 3, gta sa 5, pretty much any aaa mmorpg, etc",Weapon Wars is the worst open world game of all time.,joint-learning
