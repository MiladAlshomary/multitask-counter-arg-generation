7,t3_d9ez7a,"if you haven't been introduced to the evolutionary theory of obesity before, the basic idea is is that technology has given us easy access to unlimited cheap, tasty, low quality food. but our brains evolved in a world where wrapping something in bacon involved a lot more work, time and risk than it does today. so, mother nature didn't wast time evolving an off switch for our appetite. saying no to highly satisfying foods that are now everywhere, is like betraying a little part of what makes us human hence obesity epidemic. as i understand it, evolutionary psychology also gives us a strong instinct to adopt the ideological beliefs of our tribes in order to create group cohesion, common interests and thus much better survival odds that independent thinking. there's a crap ton of studies on concepts like norms, confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance etc. that all point to ideology as a catalyst for our beliefs that is stronger than logic. i'm obviously way oversimplifying a lot of research here, but the instinct to believe we and our tribe are 'right' despite contradictory evidence seems to be as strong, if not stronger, than our desire to eat hot pockets, with good reason. to confront obesity, we've had to create massive cultural awareness and a huge industry centered on hacking or instincts e. g. fitness, dieting, vegan food, sugar free soda, reality shows etc. we realized that our mastery of production and distribution of cheap, highly satisfying, junk food was hurting us, and we actively intervened to change course. we didn't say: ' i guess we'll just have to eat ourselves to death. ' but we often lament that the world may end in collapse, dystopia or extinction because it's inevitable that people will fight to the death over ideologies. it seems like ideology is difficult to accept as an outdated universal instinct within each of us, because unlike fat, one cannot observe the problem in one's self. it can only be acknowledged in the 'them,' to the ' us ' it feels like rational truth. my view is that accepting the food information comparison could help change the way people think about intellectual health, as a daily responsibility, not unlike exercise, and perhaps lead to more collaborative, solutions oriented political dialog.", We should treat Political Ideology like we treat Obesity - as an addiction based on evolutionary cravings that need to be hacked in a modern world.,ground-truth

' tonight i gave everything more thought and i have changed my views. the reason i didn't believe in abortion was because i believe god can do great things with all people. as long as a person can touch just one person's life positively, that can start a ripple effect and bring many more to believe in god. what if someone gets an abortion and that prevents someone from getting to heaven? i realize now, god recognizes that there are a lot of people who don't believe in god, christianity, or what ever religion you can name. those people who are having an abortion are most commonly doing it for the right reasons: to prevent a child from a life of pain in a foster home or poverty in a third world country. if everyone knew christianity was right, then i really don't believe anyone would get an abortion, but the fact is: no one knows what's correct, we can only believe in what we want or what makes the most sense to us. we all are just trying to do the right thing. 'the good place' really nails this idea. for spoilers sake i won't get into it, but it essentially talks about how no matter what we do, our actions have unintended bad consequences. a christian wanting to ban abortion does it because they think that baby has a chance with the help of god to save someone's life, on the other hand that baby could be born into a meaningless and terrible life and if god doesn't exist than all outcomes of not having an abortion are bad. a non believer sorry for the crude term, i mean no offense believes that god doesn't exist and no one will be there to save the baby from a miserable life, therefore an abortion prevents the baby from an obsolete existence. on the other hand, if god does exist than the baby was 'murdered' because there was no faith in god's plan. either way, whether god exists or doesn't, all parties: christians, atheists, agnostics, muslims, etc. everyone is trying their best to make the right decision. in the end, assuming god exists, i don't think god will judge anyone for having an abortion with the right motives. it's getting harder and harder to make choices where they are 100 correct and an all knowing being would surely recognize that. the people that make it to heaven aren't gay's vs. straights, murderers vs. saints, people who support abortions vs. people who don't, or republicans vs. democrats; god sees what's in the heart. all in all, if i were a woman i would not have an abortion, even if i was raped easy to say since i never have experienced such trauma because i would try and provide for my child and give him her a happy life, but i no longer object to other people getting an abortion because they are just trying to do the right thing. also, to men that think women shouldn't have a say in the matter, respectfully fuck off. tl;dr: everyone is just trying to do the right thing and people that believe in no god should believe in abortion with the right motives. god understands the right motives of certain possibly wrong actions.",Foster care for animals is no different than caring for children or even loving people in the good place.,pipeline-learning

84,t3_b27jfh,"here is what i mean by this: our society is making a dangerous cultural shift towards a form of relative morality that is decimating our ability to find common ground politically. i've been stewing on this idea for a while now, but i decided to write this in light of the recent attacks on the muslim church in new zealand. the shooter in this recent attack was a member of the far right, a trump supporter, and obviously held beliefs that tip toed around the superiority of whites. in short, he was the embodiment of what many progressive, left wing leaning people are very much against. he was a straight, white, 4chan browsing, alt right, trump loving, racist man. this isn't to say that those on the left hate straight white men, but he does fall into a demographic that is in many ways seen as 'the bad guys' by more liberal individuals. while reading comments on reddit and talking to coworkers and friends about the attack, one of the things that stood out to me the most was how many people blamed the ideology first and the individual second. so many 'wow more right wing terrorism' and 'the trump administration has enabled this kind of behavior'. the reason that this is so concerning to me is that it isn't an issue that is specific to either end of the political spectrum. when a muslim man shot 50 gay people in that nightclub shooting, so many on the left were quick to stand up and remind everyone that not all muslims are dangerous, and that each should be judged on an individual basis. while many of the right used this incident to capitalize on people's fear and label all of islam as dangerous. the reason this matters is because our responses to situations are no longer being based on what happened, but who was involved. when whether or not someone was in the wrong depends on their identity, then all basis for a concrete worldview is lost. one of my favorite pictures of all time is painting of jesus and a nazi guard. in the painting jesus and the nazi soldier are walking together down a dirt road together, while deep in conversation and jesus himself is carrying the nazi soldier's pack and firearm. what makes this painting so powerful is that it shows what it means to be kind and non judgmental to everyone, even a nazi. it illustrates what it means to hold everyone you encounter to the same standard, because the rule of morality in this case being kind supersedes who is on the receiving end. this is the reason that i believe so many people are becoming disillusioned with our current two party system. there is no consistency in their worldview because it changes so drastically based on who it is being applied to. this is a huge problem.",Presidency of Donald Trump on the right and hate/politicization is causing societal change in America,pipeline-learning

224,t3_b23zt2,"before i start, i am not writing this with a very specific issue in mind, i have always believed this. i am sick of that perfectly true, but ideologically pointless argument that while you have free speech, privately owned platforms like reddit, youtube, fb etc don't have any obligation to allow you to express yourself on their platforms. this is very insincere way to 'support free speech' and is actually just the opposite, supporting censorship. i am personally from an european country that like most european countries doesn't even have anything like the right to free speech, although ironically i have to say that due to less pc culture there is very little censorship actually happening. but as a liberal, i have strong respect for the us 1st amendment, and since i agree ideologically, i naturally also believe that the principle should be upheld in private institutions and platforms as well. first, all big platforms used for communication and exchange of ideas are in fact privately owned although they are all from us : youtube, fb, reddit, even google apparently can remove content from appearing when you search for it. the point of free speech is partially being able to speak freely without fear of persecution, but the other important point is being able to exercise it in the first place, share your thoughts and ideas. people don't need to listen to them, but if your thoughts and ideas are virtually removed from every platform accessible to a normal person, this is the equivalent of burning books. you are made invisible. another aspect of it which oddly many other liberals seem to not care about is my right as a consumer of ideas to have access to everything and choose for myself what is good and what is bad for me. the discussion is often phrased as to protect people from upsetting content, but even if the content is trashing everything important to me and relevant to my identity, it is so much more disrespectful for someone else to decide that i should be protected from the chance of being exposed to it after which i can easily ignore it. again, it is book burning. , free speech is only your true value if it can actually be heard. having said that, i completely understand that certain environments need to exist where content is censored for two reasons first is that the content is very specific or that the whole point is some very specific formatting of submitted ideas e. g. changemyview can't accept askreddit posts, a channel focused on history can't show sitcoms . that is fine, compartmentalization is ok as long as the rules of it are clear and there is possibility for all kinds of content to be developed in it's own compartment. second is the emotional need for people to have safe spaces where their own ideas never get questioned or provoked again, this is fine too as long as everyone is entitled to the same, and opposite spaces. the real fear is free speech can influence people to do violent things, but i think that nothing short of providing illegal information e. g. doxxing an individual, or telling people where to go buy illegal weapons and organizing attacks should matter. art has since its inception had the liberty to examine all kinds of topics in its own way. some of the greatest works of literature include a book that is written from a pedophile's pov, book from a killer's pov, serial killer's pov there are classic paintings depicting torture and suffering. songs that talk about war, violence and hatred. human mind can go to dark places and get incredible inspiration from them that can intellectually enrich us. understanding the world around us, the good, the bad and the ugly, makes us informed. there will always be someone who snapps and who will go and do horrible things, and at every moment in time there was something else to blame for it satanic influence, a book, a song, a movie, a video game, a youtube video as we move through time these scapegoats are always whatever is relevant and still pretty new, but the principle is the same. actions are the responsibility of the person who committed them, ideas and thoughts need to remain visible for us to see, judge, discuss etc. there are bad ideas and bad ideologies, but the only way they should be addressed is though better ideas and better ideologies, not removal. furthermore, in judging what is a bad idea ideology, there is huge hypocrisy. many, maybe all, big and popular ideologies have resulted with some misinterpretation, radicalism, violence and harm to others from religions, to systems like communism, capitalism etc. so it is completely disingenuous to talk about misinterpretation when convenient but run and ban a piece of writing or a youtube video which is much less popular as soon as it gets linked to something violent. if a privately owned platform has a monopoly over communication, then they should be obliged to withhold the ideological principles of free speech, and the fact that they are pushed to do the opposite is shameful. in fear of bad ideas getting through, we are making it so that few people decide which ideas we can hear in the first place. you can't honestly stand by free speech and be ok with this as long as it affects ideas you don't like either. gt; the value of free speech us 1st amendment is completely compromised if you exclude from it the private platforms which have complete monopoly over communications, and idea knowledge exchange. if this is a true value you hold, you would insist that the principle of it is maintained so that no idea gets muted, and respect the dignity of the consumers of ideas to choose for themselves what to take in and what to make of it. what is the point of free speech if you can't exercise it?",Articles and ideas should not be censored on

there is no doubt that many people liked how the show ended. they seem to be the minority these days and i think half of them want to believe the show ended well because deep down they really love the show and want it to be great. basically lying to themselves so they don't have to accept that the show has really gone downhill. look, i want to believe this too, i wanted to believe my little pony season 5 8 were great because i love the show but in all honesty, those were riddled with uninteresting stories. season 9 is great though, go check it out. to those fans, this is exactly why we need a remake, so the show can actually recapture its greatness. and to the people who did like the ending, sure, some people certainly liked it. but can you not deny the obvious quality drop for the show? which leads me to the next point. amp; x200b; stop assuming just because something is done one way, that it's the best it could ever be. why do people assume that just because it's done, it couldn't have been better. that what was presented in season 8 is the best got could have give us or that if it were remade it would have the possibility of being worse. this is a massive straw man point by doubters. the criticism here is that if we were to remake season 8, it would just be a worse version or there is no telling if it'll be worse. it's a very bad criticism because it's assuming that season 8 is the middle ground between good and bad. well, it's simply not, season 8 was bad, very bad. i've written stories with better flow for my english essays that what season 8 produced. heck, the writers for rapunzel's tangled adventure have done a much better job at creating a story than what season 8 was. all hbo has to do is hire some veteran story boarders and i promise there is a 99 chance that they could write a better storyboard for season 8 than what was presented. amp; x200b; it can't be done. can't it though, the main motivation for hbo is profit, and i don't doubt some people in the network also enjoy the show as fans. i'm not sure if it's just a joke but people have been saying they're cancelling their hbo subscription after the series is over. we'll have to see the numbers to tell. i would be okay if they made the episodes animated, this would cost approximately 1 million dollars an episode if they do it like other cartoons. i suggest checking out the animation for rapunzel's tangled adventure because i believe their animation style can work very well with got. also, got has been a huge seller for hbo, keeping it around for a few more seasons would not hurt their bottom line. i don't even care if they bring back the old actors, i don't really want to see them again, no offense. the more they can bring back, good, but there's no saying that people only watch for the actors. would some people be upset that the original cast is gone, yeah, is it a deal breaker? probably not. not i expect people to bring up the sequel series as reasons why hbo should just move one but, amp; x200b; maintain the legacy of the show. having a bad final season especially for long story arc adventures can severely cripple the show even for the first few seasons. if i had heard that got starts off amazing but ends up shit, i would have no interest in starting got in the first place. what do people who have never watched lost think about lost? well, i'm one of them and all i know about the show is that it started out strong but had a horrible ending. that's basically all i know about the show. this will be the legacy of got for the next few decades if nothing is done and this is really sad because got could really have taken the title of the great show ever at least in the eyes of the general public. most people will have personal preferences sure and argue that got was indeed not the best and so on and so forth. having a strong legacy to stand on would also mean the subsequent shows are viewed more favorably. infact, hbo is already invested in creating more stories in the gotverse. why not allocate that budget to fixing the last two seasons. it'll probably draw the same amount of viewership anyway so there is no net loss on hbo's part and a lot to gain. amp; x200b; do it for the fans. i mean come on, 1 million people signed the petition, what more do you need to tell you that you severely fucked up the final season. remember how excited people were for seasons 2,3,4,5 and 6? the media wouldn't stop talking about every aspect of the show. and look what happened in the last two. sure, it draws more media attention to most other shows but nowhere near as much as previous seasons. the fan fervor have simply worn off with ever decreasingly bad story telling from seasons 5 onwards. amp; x200b; i know some of you will have some common criticisms so i'll address them here first. also, a lot of yall are going to skip reading the paragraphs and only read dot points. amp; x200b; 1. it won't happen bro, give up. it's all about the benjamins baby, go read what i actually wrote and how it'll be profitable for hbo. 2. remaking seasons 8 would decrease dvd sales. true, but i think the readded interest in the show and the show continuing for a little longer would decrease that effect and infact be more profitable in the end. 3. the actors and actresses won't come back. some of them would if not most, but i don't even care about that. if you only watch a show for the actors then that's kind of cool i guess but most people don't. we can live with the characters being recast as long as the story is good. 4. what if the show becomes worse? again, if you need that answered you probably never read what i wrote. and although there is a chance it can get worse, i believe even an amateur writer who puts time and effort into remaking the show would have done a better job that d amp;d. infact, why are people assuming that d amp;d knows what's best for the series or understand's george rr martin's vision. i would nominate preston jacobs a youtuber to be far more knowledgable of the themes of the show. and wasn't there a couple that ghost wrote a world of ice and fire, they probably would have done a better job even with 0 experience given just how shit the final season was. hbo, don't be the network that lets your show die. break conventions for once and become known as the network that recognized what they did was bad and gave us and made it better.",Net income makes me think that there is no point being upset about the endings to The Walking Dead,pipeline-learning

308,t3_b81ogr,"narcissism this is my main hypothesis. unfortunately, i don't think that simply stating a thesis statement does it justice. however, here's a strong hint about my thesis: gt; i believe that the vast majority of human beings use the same thought process and that society itself is a emergent manifestation of this thought process. the thought process that i'm referring to is: gt; a inherent tendency towards narcissism due to each individual's subjective experience of objective reality now, hold on a sec let me be very clear. the definitions that i use might not match the definitions so i'm going to try to define term that i use that i believe is integral to a proper understanding of my theory. let's start with gt; narcissism: an overabundance of ego but that definition alone doesn't clarify very much, now does it? let's see if we can clarify things further: gt; ego: the part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity disclaimers: let me clarify really quickly that i'm using the psycho analytical terms of gt; ego and gt; narcissism here and probably partially redefining one or both terms as well . also, i don't believe that everyone is a narcissist, just that all human beings have a latent tendency towards narcissism. i'm adding this disclaimer here because i was informed that it was necessary to clarify this fact early. now, there's something interesting in this definition which i pulled right off google, btw : gt; if ego is the part of the mind that is responsible for an individual's sense of personal identity, then it could also be argued that the ego is also responsible for separating the mind from objective reality itself if gt; a sense of personal identity is interpreted as gt; a mental shield against reality then gt; an overabundance of ego would mean gt; behavior that is based on an unrealistic belief system and if we theorize, as i do, that gt; every human being inherently seeks to be the hero of their story then gt; behavior that is based on an unrealistic belief system, a. k. a. an overabundance of ego, a. k. a. narcissism would have to be the cause of every hurtful thing that we humans do so how did we end up here? how are such horrendous acts committed daily if the vast majority of human beings actually are good natured? here is the process that i think occurs: gt; given: an individual inherently biased to think that they are superior to the average or 'special' while the masses are generally sheep due to every individual's subjective experience of objective reality gt; gt; when: said individual makes a mistake and screws something up by not paying enough attention to objective reality gt; gt; then: said individual makes a subconscious choice: gt; either: gt; a: they accept responsibility for their failure, subconsciously choose to pay more attention to objective reality, and gain additional self awareness, or gt; b: they blame someone or something else for their failure. this process occurs every time an individual fails and individuals prone towards believing they are superior which are generally individuals born into privilege are more likely to make the wrong choice. which is why narcissism gets worse over time. first, you just distrust others, then you begin to feel entitled to things, then that entitlement can grow into full blown sociopathy and or neurosis, psychosis, and other mental disorders. why aren't people aware of this process? why can't people just fix it themselves? i'm glad you asked. gt; i believe that every individual wants to be the hero of their story so badly that the subconscious mind will use the 10 d's of political opposition tactics against our experience of objective reality in order to project the individual's ego in fact, i have seen this happen repeatedly through personal experience when confronting other narcissists. chapter 35. responding to counterattacks section 1. overview of learn the different forms of opposition one may face, and options for countering them, including the ten d s, ranging from deflection to discring. oh, yeah my name is judah meek and i'm a recovering narcissist. a lot of this hypothesis has been created based on self analysis and then looking for evidence of similar mental processes in others. i don't believe that everyone is a narcissist, just that all human beings have a latent tendency towards narcissism. individuals who experience trauma early in life gain anxieties which counters their latent belief in their own superiority or specialness and increases the chances of them making the right decision whenever they make a mistake. unfortunately, anxieties come at an extremely high mental amp; emotional and possibly physical cost, which can limit an individual's potential nearly as much as narcissism can. so why does this hypothesis matter? what is the value in knowing how human beings think? well there's a ton of potential value here. first of all, there's mitigating damage that narcissists create in society itself and that requires knowledge of how narcissists act and think. see, narcissism commonly manifests itself in what is known as 'manipulative narcissism', but the fact is that those traits exist on a spectrum and nearly everyone who is not fighting with high anxiety uses narcissistic manipulations from time to time. narcissists are, by the very nature of narcissism, distrusting, territorial, hypocritical, and prone to putting words in other people's mouths. because of this, they damage relationships and awareness of their actions and tendencies can restore the trust necessary to repair those relationships. also, narcissists create narcissistic systems, including narcissistic cultures. have you ever wondered why political gridlock exists? have you ever wondered how your sweet mother or father can believe in q anon or why they won't stop watching fox news? narcissism is the reason and awareness of that is the first step in getting them the proper help to treat their disorder. narcissism is also the root cause of counterproductive behavior ranging from hypochondria and hoarding to conspiracy creation, scams, and cults to domestic abuse, rape, and child molestation. and that's just at the individual level, institutional narcissism is why we fight over immigration, why the american intelligence agencies don't share information like they should, why american criminal justice is a parody of what it should be, and why 6 million jews died during the holocaust. there's a lot more to this, but for now, i'll just let you digest this. feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or want to know more.",Humanity is built on narcissism,joint-learning

315,t3_b99sdf,"there is a benefit to diversity in movies, and tv, and this benefit is not lost on me. being part of a particular group in our society, be it your gender, racial group, sexual orientation etc. is going to influence your life in a particular way. given that people within the same group, are going to have that same influence, that's going to lead to general similarities in their lives and experiences. similarities that people outside of their group, won't necessarily be able to relate to as well. that being the case it seems that more diverse representation, is going to increase the chances that an audience member can experience a character who speaks to them on a more personal level, so it's more likely that they'll take something worthwhile away from their experience. making the audience as a whole, take as much away from their experience as possible is of course a good thing. however, while there is that upside, this focus on diversity in media, is doing more harm than good, because it encourages a counterproductive mode of thought. as an anecdotal example to illustrate what is being said here, i am a male. of the 3 star wars trilogies that currently exist, the main characters in 2 of them were young white males like myself, and the main character in 1 is a female. even though she's female however, she's a character with a story, which speaks to me on a personal level, far more than either of the other 2 protagonists did no need to get into the specifics of my life story that lead me to feel this way as another example, a movie that i consider to be one of the better movies of the last few years is moonlight, and i felt a very significant personal connection with that movie. a while ago, i had to write about a life experience for a school assignment, and my teacher was very happy with it. when asked about it, i said that moonlight was my main source of inspiration, which you would never imagine on the surface, because i'm not black, or gay, or someone who grew up really poor, and this personal experience didn't even involve romantic love. in both these cases, i made a personal connection, despite not being the same demographic as the characters, because in my mind, i made sure that i wasn't thinking too superficially about what i was looking at. i didn't just take what i was seeing with those character at face value. i delved into what those stories were trying to say. i boiled down what was being portrayed to the core, where i found something being said, that was universal, and could be of value to practically anyone. this is the sort of thinking that i believe is necessary when experiencing a story, and this is what i feel we're getting away from, in large part due to priorities of equal representation. ideas like 'we need more gay representation, for the sake of gay people' for example. this attitude is making us lose sight of the fact that if gay people experience a story involving straight romantic love, there is still something of value there for them, and they're not tapping into that, and getting as much value as they could, because they're not necessarily thinking hard enough about it. i'm not a gay person, and i found something of value when i had the experience of watching moonlight. some might say 'well, that's an unfair comparison, you just have to make that adjustment on sporadic occasions. gay people have to the put in the work of doing that all the time. ' to which i would say, that the act of making that adjustment really shouldn't be such hard work. it should be an act of in depth thinking which comes more naturally to us. a great story should have a universal nature to it, and be able to speak to you regardless of your life situation. our emphasis on representation is getting us away from that, and thus it does more harm than good.","Film, TV, Music, etc. should not focus on diversity in the main characters, because it encourages a counterproductive mode of thought.",joint-learning
