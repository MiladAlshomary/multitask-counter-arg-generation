t3_bmpjbc," You cannot genuinely claim to be pro-life because you think it is murder, if you have exceptions related to the circumstances of conception : for transparency: i'm pro choice i understand the concept of being pro life but making an exception in a medical emergency, as in the mother and or fetus would die without an abortion. someone is going to die anyway in that situation, so i understand the viewpoint. however, i do not understand being vehemently against abortion on the grounds that is it murder and yet making an exception for instances of rape or incest. if you claim that the reason you are pro life is because you believe abortion is murder, then the circumstances of conception should not change your view. i often see conversations about it go like this: 'what about if she was raped? ' 'well obviously that's different, she couldn't prevent that and it's not her fault. don't bring rare cases into this. ' as soon as they make this point, i no longer think that they truly believe abortion is murder. the same person often insists that their opinion has nothing to do with controlling or punishing women, but the moment they say 'that's different, she couldn't prevent it' they are implying that in other circumstances it is the woman's 'fault,' thus making this about punishing women. if you truly think abortion is murder, these things shouldn't matter to you. you don't kill someone for the crimes of another person. if you really think it is killing a baby, why would you say 'well it's okay to kill a baby sometimes i guess. ' no, you would say 'that's sad and unfortunate but you can't just kill an innocent baby. ' i understand that people are pro life for many different reasons. for some people it might make logical sense that they would make this exception, depending on why they are pro life. but if you are pro life because you think it is murder, then it doesn't make sense to have these exceptions. especially if you make these exceptions but claim that it has nothing to do with punishing women who 'got themselves into this situation', in which case i think you are wrong whether you consciously realize it or not. i would like to hear some other opinions because this has never made sense to me.","i think you're conflating the two sides of the abortion debate. abortion is not murder. it is the killing of a human being. the fetus is not a living being, it is a part of the mother's body. the mother is not responsible for the actions of the fetus, and the fetus does not have a right to live outside of her body. there is no difference between killing a human and killing a fetus.","i'm pro life because i believe that the right to life is the most basic human right, and that it should not be infringed on. i'm pro choice because i don't believe that abortion is murder, but i do believe that it is morally wrong to force a woman to carry a child to term against her will, even if she can't prevent it. it's not a question of whether or not it's her fault, it's a matter of morality.","i think you're conflating two very different things. in the first case, you're talking about a person who believes that abortion is murder, and in the second case, someone who believes abortion is not murder. the first person believes that a fetus is a human being, and that it has the right to life. the second person believes it is not a human, and therefore cannot be killed. in both cases, the person who is pro life believes that the fetus","i think it's important to distinguish between being pro life and being pro choice. if you're pro choice, then you're also pro life because you believe that abortion is wrong. you're not pro choice because you don't think abortion is right, but because you think that it's wrong for women to be forced to carry a pregnancy to term."
t3_au01pd," Gay Conversion Therapy is a CONCEPTUALLY viable : i am a strong supporter of lgbt rights. i am not trying to convert anyone away from their identity or sexuality. i am proposing an idea here. only an idea. im not saying i support this. don't assume me be a moral bad guy please. i know this is controversial. ok, here's my argument. there are potentially viable gay conversion therapies gct . tell me why there wouldnt be? i dont really have a strong view about the backbone reasons people are gay. obviously some balance between nature and nurture, different people fall on different areas of the nature nurture scale. the same can be said for other defining behaviors. some people are depressed because of nature, some are depressed because they are born that way. some people are susceptible to cancer because of nature, others are predisposed to cancer because they were born with it. to the degree that anyone is unhappy with being gay, some form of gct should be available to them. this might be a chemical intervention, such as hormone treatment or some theoretical drug to suppress sexual urges i dont have a clear idea of what type of drug or surgery may be viable. alternately, there could be a psychological therapy that may be available to someone. i recognize any discussion of gct is controversial because conservatives and religious people have a history of attacking gay people and think being gay is bad and they try to force their shitty view on people. they have tried to make being gay somehow immoral and a humiliation or something. idk, they are idiots. im not arguing that. im just saying that there may be some subset of gay people who just would prefer not to be gay, and i suspect there is an actual means to help them based on science. cmv","conversion therapy can be used to treat mental health issues that are beyond the control of the individual. for example, depression can be treated with medication, but there is no guarantee that it will cure the underlying cause of the problem. there are people who are depressed because of their sexuality, but that doesn't mean that they want to kill themselves. it's not that they don't want to be gay, it's that they can't deal with it. i don't think","conversion therapy is not a viable treatment for gay people. it's not something that can be used to 'cure' homosexuality, it's a treatment to treat a mental illness. there is no evidence that it has any effect on people who are gay.","there is no evidence that any of these treatments have been tried. there are no studies that show that they have any effect at all. there is very little evidence that they work, and there is no reason to believe that they will work. i'm not saying that they won't work, but i don't think it's a good idea to give them to anyone.","there is no evidence that sex change treatments are effective at treating homosexuality, so there is no reason to expect them to be effective in treating homosexuality."
t3_bvxqiw," High School debates should require their contestants to slow down to let non-debaters understand them : an example: disclaimer: i have no experience in debate. a little bit of background first. since becoming a poster on r cmv, i remembered that my high school had a debate club. so, let's go on youtube and enjoy high quality debates! then, i searched 2018 debate championships. i couldn't believe my ears. they were speaking so fast at 300 words per minute or something, i couldn't understand anything. why were they doing this? it turns out that it's a technique called spreading. spreading is the act of speaking extremely fast during a competitive debating event, with the hope that one's opponent will be penalised for failing to respond to all arguments raised. so if i use my allocated time to raise 10 points, and you only respond to 8, the judge will automatically rule in favour of me for the two remaining points. i understand that judges are mostly ex debators and are trained to listen to and understand these debators. however, outside the circuit of debators and judges, most outsiders do not understand a single point of the debate. i am sure that there are benefits to outsiders being able to understand the points being made in the debate. on of them, of course, is to appreciate other perspectives and change their view. imagine if r cmv was only voice and spoken at 400 words per minute. as these debators are just playing within the rules of the competition, maybe it is the competition itself that should be changed.","there is a difference between being able to understand the content of a debate and understanding the rules of the debate itself. i think it is important to understand that debate is not a competition, it is a means to an end in itself. there is no such thing as a fair debate, and the purpose of a good debate is to educate people on the topic being debated. i don't think it's fair to say that it's unfair to judge someone based on their ability to","i don't think it's fair to say that high school debates should require their contestants to slow down to let non debaters understand them. the purpose of a high school debate is to teach students how to debate. it's not to teach them how to communicate well, it's to test their knowledge of the topic.",i don't think it's a good idea for a debate team to ensure that they get every single point out of their own group. it's not a good way for them to ensure they get all of their points out of the rest of their group. a single point is a huge disadvantage to a team that is trying to win the competition.,"i don't think it's a technique, it's an expression of free speech. i don't know what you're talking about, but i'm not sure i understand it. i think you're arguing against the idea that people should be able to freely express their opinions without being penalised for doing so."
t3_bws4rh," Life is hard for rich kids : over the past few years, i've gotten to personally know people who grew up with rich parents. the wealth these families have is between 5m to 40m as far as i know. i believe the life of most rich kids is pretty hard. amp; x200b; most of them have completely different outlooks on life than someone from a lower, middle or even upperclass household. what i found is that, they aren't planning on normal careers or employment jobs. they go to universities or college for the status of having a degree rather than the need of it. they know their parents will find something for them to do or give them money to pursue their goals in business or investments. this sounds like an easy road for them, but it has lots of downsides. it can destroy their motivation knowing they will never have to practice for an interview, acquire people skills, learn how to work with teams, negotiate raises, stick to a schedule. i noticed a lot of rich kids are socially awkward and have a hard time getting though life without the help of their parents even in their late 20's. amp; x200b; the stigma. rich kids will feel sad too but who cares, their parents are rich, right? i've witnessed this a lot, when rich kids talk about something that bothers them, they get a sarcastic 'life must be so hard! ' comments. they most likely will always be known for having rich parents so their accomplishments are never fully theirs according to many people. they also have to deal with people that randomly hate them because they are rich. amp; x200b; rich kids grew up without having to worry about money like 99 of the population. there isn't a community online where rich kids can go to talk about these things. how can you relate to someone that has to pay most of their income in rent while your dad owns entire apartment buildings? how can you relate to someone trying to get good grades and working so hard in college when your dad will give you a job or buy you a business or let you live off investments? how can you relate to the movies, music, books when none of that stuff is targeted to rich people like you?","i think it's important to remember that rich kids don't have the same experiences as poor kids. they don't grow up in the same environment as the poor. they grow up surrounded by people who don't really care about them. they are exposed to a lot of different things than the poor, and they're exposed to different kinds of people. they aren't exposed to the same things that poor kids have to deal with.","i have a friend who grew up in a very wealthy family, and he's a very intelligent guy. he's in his 20s now. he has a degree in finance and has a job that pays well above minimum wage, but he's still working to make ends meet. he is also a very introverted guy, so he's not socially awkward. i don't know many rich kids, but i know a lot of people who are in their 20s and 30","i don't think it's fair to say that rich kids are 'better than anyone else.'i think that's a bit of an oversimplification of the situation. i think rich kids have a lot of advantages and disadvantages, and i think there's a lot to be said for them. but i don't know enough about them to say they're better than everyone else.","the life of rich kids isn't hard because of their parents. it's hard because they aren't having to worry about money. they don't have to deal with people that randomly hate them because they are rich. the stigma that rich kids deal with is because their parents are rich, not because of the life of the rich kids."
t3_a8jlgb," Politics is a good reason to end a relationship : i remember there being a small rash of news stories about couples, some married for years, breaking up in the wake up of the trump election as a result of who people voted for. a similar thing happened on a smaller level with brexit in the uk. this was met with a lot of comments from people in news sites saying that was a stupid reason to break up, but i disagree. ' politics' isn't just a game politicians play, or something that happens away from the world. political views reveal a lot about beliefs on society, rights, justice, and basically political views are very intertwined with personal morality. having a partner who challenges you is good, but wide differences are a legitimate break in a relationship. i would argue the couple who broke up after years of marriage in the wake of the american election didn't break up trivially because political parties suddenly became important, but that they'd ignored that aspect of their relationship if neither was interested in politics, and the election revealed some very deep personal divides which were irreconcilable. so, political differences can be a make or break aspect of a relationship, and justifiably so.","i think the difference between marriage and political differences is that marriage is a contract. it's a legal contract, not a social contract. if you break up, you're no longer legally bound by the terms of the contract, and are free to move on. marriage is not a contract, it's an agreement between two people.","politics isn't a good reason to end a relationship, it's a bad reason to start a new one. it's not a valid reason to break up, but it's an important reason to not be in a relationship with someone who holds political views you disagree with.","political differences can be a great motivator for people to break up, but they can also be a very good motivator to stay together. it's a lot easier to stay in a relationship with someone if you have a common interest in the same goals and values.","political differences are not a make or break aspect of a relationship, and justifiably so. there are a lot of people in relationships who have political differences, but that doesn't mean they aren't in a healthy relationship."
t3_b6l9bg," Reincarnation makes more sense than eternal oblivion. : i don't mean reincarnation as most people understand it, where the 'soul' survives the death of the physical body and inhabits a new body. this form of reincarnation doesn't require the existence of souls or for the consciousness to otherwise survive the death of the physical body. this goes by the scientific consensus that consciousness of purely a product of the brain, and that when the brain dies, so does its consciousness. those who believe in eternal oblivion compare being dead to before you were born; no consciousness, no perception, no thinking, nothing. presumably eternal oblivion is supposed to mean you don't exist, then you do exist, but only once, and after that you never exist again ever. but if you went from nothingness to being alive for this life, what is stopping the same thing from happening in the future after you die in this life? here, 'you' does not mean the exact individual you are now. it just means the feeling of a conscious first person perspective. when you're born again, you'll be a completely different person with a new personality and no memory of this life. this would also mean that cases of someone claiming to remember a past life have an explanation other than reincarnation, as in this theory, the brain and its current consciousness are destroyed so it would be impossible for someone to remember a past life. this is untestable and unfalsifiable, but so is eternal oblivion.","there are a few things to consider. first, there is the possibility of reincarnation being a product of the brain and not the brain itself. it is not the case that the brain dies, but that it is destroyed. second, it is possible that the soul survives the death of the physical body and inhabits a new body. third, there are cases of people claiming to remember a past life but not a new one. fourth, the idea of eternal oblivion is","the problem with eternal oblivion is that you can't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. the only way to know if you're still alive is to look at your brain and see what it looks like when you're alive. if you don't have any memories of your past life, then there's no way for you to know what you were before you were born.","i don't think eternal oblivion can be proven, but it can be theorized. it is not impossible for the reason people want it to be possible. it's not impossible because it's possible, it's impossible because we don't know what it would be like.","the idea of eternal oblivion doesn't mean you don't exist, it just means that you exist only once, and after that you never exist again ever. i don't think it's possible for the soul to survive the death of the physical body, so it would be impossible for the consciousness of the brain to survive."

t3_aam125," investing in the stock market is a fundamentally Grey to Dark moral endeavor : center left here, mildly libertarian also i'd like to invest in stocks in the future the thing is, i can't see how investing in the stock market can be a morally positive action in my country, i don't know if this is true for other countries, stocks are split into two kinds: preferential and ordinary preferential stocks give you the right to a share of a company's dividends; ordinary stocks give you the right of voting for the preferred course of action to be taken by the company some ordinary stocks also yield dividends, but only very few my main goal in buying stocks would be the dividends, because it would then allow me to have more free income in the future but what about the immorality of a company's actions for instance, let's say i buy some of a certain company's shares if the company is being abusive with its costumers as a certain energy company is being in my country i would have no voice in it in my head, signing up for this would be like being passively corrupt: allowing others to do evil while i'm being benefited of course, i could sell my stocks on the spot once a thing like this happens on the other hand, i could buy ordinary stocks and once they valued i could sell them however, i can't see how that would be morally positive, too, because if i do this then it means i was not in it out of good will, but for selfish purposes however, i could buy the stocks, and keep buying them, acquire a large number of the shares of the company and have a loud voice in the modus operandi of the company however, i would not profit a single coin from this, unless i sold the stocks which counteracts my initial intention , so it would have to be entirely selfless so, in my mind, there are only two options: 1 buy dividends stocks and be compliant to any possible misdeeds made by the company 2 buy non dividend stocks for the sake of having a voice regarding the company's actions of course, i can also buy the shares of the two companies that are 'ethical', but i'm throwing this option to the wayside for the sake of the argument","i think the problem with the stock market is that it's a very poor way to judge whether or not a company is doing something good or bad. it's not a perfect system, but it's the best we have. if you buy a dividend stock, you're taking a risk on the fact that the company will pay you a dividend, but if you sell it, you'll lose a lot of money. that's why it's called a buy and hold strategy.","i think the stock market is a fundamentally grey to dark moral endeavor. it's the only place where you can buy and hold a large amount of a company's stock and then vote on its board of directors. if you buy the stock you have the right to vote on the board, but you don't have a voice in the company's actions. you can't vote for the board. if the board is corrupt, you can vote against them. if they are ethical,","i don't think it's fair to say that the stock market should not be a financial activity in your country, because it's an economic activity. it's the most efficient means of transferring wealth between people. it allows people to make money, and it's a way to share that wealth with others. if you don't like it, then you can sell your shares. but if you like it and want to keep it, you can do so.","the stock market isn't just a place to buy stocks, it's a place where people have a voice in how the market is run. if you want to be able to vote for the company, you have the right to do so. you don't have to like the company but you have a right to voice your opinion about it. if the company is being abusive to its costumers, you can voice your"

t3_c2untx," Artists would continue to create great and incredible works even if there were no financial incentive whatsoever. Even if these works of art took a significant time and financial investment. : my view is that artists will create art, even highly involved and skilled works of art, even if there is no financial incentive whatsoever. even if this art requires a financial investment that will receive no return. i have never heard of or seen a society in which artists didn t create art. it has never happened in all of modern civilization. the deepest of poverty? doesn t stop artists from creating art. history shows that artists will even devote their own free time to art for years or even decades without ever making a profit or even expecting one. change my view by showing me a time in which a society somewhere on earth didn t have artists producing consistently great and valuable works. we also know that today s world is over saturated with art in the sense that there is more of it than any person could ever consume, even if they spent every second of their entire lifetime trying. so, add on to my view that we would still have more art than anyone could ever consume, even if there were no financial incentive whatsoever to create more of it.","even if there is no financial incentive to create art, artists will still create art. even if this art requires a financial investment that will receive no return, it is still art. if an artist has no income, they will continue to make art, even if they are not making a profit.","if there were no financial incentive, artists would continue to create great and incredible works even if they didn't receive no return. if you look at the history of art, you'll find that it's not uncommon for artists to create art without any financial incentive. it's also not uncommon that artists are motivated to make art even when they don't make any money.","if there were no financial incentive for an artist to create art, then it would have more art than anyone could ever consume. it would be impossible to have more than a finite amount of art. there is simply too much of it.","i think you are overestimating the amount of art that is produced by artists. there is a lot of art out there, but i don't think it is as great as you think."
t3_bmod5u," Trying to focus on the ""heroes"" of shooting incidents is a smokescreen and a disservice to those who died : i know there's all kinds of preaching on this site and others about ignoring the shooters and focusing on the 'heroes'. in my opinion, it's a phony, cheap way to continue to ignore the blatant reality that's right in our faces: we as a nation must do more to control access to guns and to provide better mental health services. full stop. while i'm sure it makes people feel good to distract us with stories about the kids who died to save others instead of focusing on why they're dead, the reality is that these kids should still be alive. students should not be afraid of going to school. we should not be allowing a corrupt, compromised small association who represents weapons manufacturers keeping us from common sense legislation that puts reasonable restrictions on the ability to own something that is designed to kill someone or something else. focusing on the victims is the same smokescreen as the rallying cry of 'mental health! ' these are both straw men that distract us from going to the heart of a problem that is getting worse, that has a very obvious cause, and that we're apparently not allowed to address. to change my view, you'll need to prove that focusing on victims does literally anything to prevent gun violence; that it does anything to deter people from pursuing acts of violence; that it leads to any positive change whatsoever. we did nothing when several dozen elementary schoolers were murdered, so you'll have a hard time finding any way to prove that this is anything more than a distraction.","i think you're missing the point of focusing on the victims of school shootings. it's not a distraction, it's a way to keep the focus on the real problem, which is mental health issues. if you want to focus on mental health, you have to address the root cause of the problem, not just the symptoms.","i think it's important to focus on the 'heroes' of shooting incidents because they are often the ones who save the lives of others. i don't think we should be focusing on the victims because it's a distraction from the real problem, which is mental illness. mental illness is a problem that needs to be addressed, but it's not the cause of gun violence.","i don't think focusing on the victims of mass shootings does anything to deter people from pursuing acts of violence, but i do think that it is a good way to bring attention to the issue of gun violence. it's not that we can't do more to control access to guns and to provide better mental health services, but it's a good idea to focus attention on the people who are the victims.","i don't think it's a distraction at all. it's an effective way to get people to focus on what's actually going on in the world rather than what's being said on the internet. i'm not saying it's good, but it's the best way to do it."

t3_bm2rac," We are hosts for memes : website on this topic: wearehostsformemes. com ted talk from susan blackmore 9 qx5hz4 kialo debate thread on this topic memetics this meme is much older than me. i was just infected by it. memes are patterns of information that can indirectly influence their surroundings. this includes any text, thought, sense or symbol that can be understood. examples of 'memes': ideas, stories, ideologies, narratives, brands, identities, thoughts. memes exist inside carriers, or hosts. you and me are hosts, whether you like it or not. memes have direct power over hosts, and power over the natural world through us. memes can be parasitic, symbiotic or benign, depending on the effect on the hosts. the strong memes survive, and some memes do so at the expense of their hosts. the same principles of natural selection and evolution applies for memes. memes are a parallel from biologic genes consider them memory genes both carry information, mutate and spread in the natural world. the term 'meme' was coined by richard dawkins in his 1976 book the selfish gene. memes don't refer to 'internet memes' in this case, which are the popular format of memes that spread on the internet for humor purposes. this is a more broad and general idea. memes can be dormant: like written in a book, in a website no one accesses or depicted on a t shirt that no one sees or wears. memes are active when they are being repeated by a host. for others to hear or for himself to hear, for the meme to spread. a social media page that is getting 10,000 accesses a day is an active meme. computers can act as hosts too, in the internet age. this one in front of you included. an advertisement billboard can be a host. the host doesn't need to be alive, it just needs to be active in some way in spreading information. memes are selfish, just like genes are. they can damage the hosts if that means higher chances of replication see smoking, drinking, marketing, social media, politics, religion, terrorism, gambling most memes are mostly time wasters, and at worst damaging or even self damaging. any damaging meme is called a toxic meme. examples of toxic memes: scientology, anti vax movement, toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, many political or religious ideologies, marketing campaigns. we have no shortage of them. memes are not spread based on their usefulness to us or based on truth. they are spread based on their fitness to the environment. memes are selfish, and they face a struggle with existence. if they don't repeat themselves, they die out. the current memes that are alive are sticky, and they resist death. the reason most people don't want to give attention to things we disagree with is because the memes we currently are carrying are reacting negatively to competition. if they didn't do that, the memes we host would've died long ago. as many past ideas and memes we held died out. it's hard to predict if a meme will be toxic, but you can identify which ones have been toxic by their effects on the hosts and the world in the past. a narrow subset of memes can be beneficial, but they must be selected and tested. for the benefit of you and me, the living hosts. we can suffer, but memes cannot suffer. they can make us suffer. we have core memes that are driving us. we call those beliefs and identities. the ego is the meme that is speaking when we start a sentence with 'i' or 'me' or 'my' that is not you speaking. it's a meme speaking. you are an entire collection of memes, a whole complex of memes. you are not in control. they are in control. if you think you are in control, it's just another meme being expressed and spread. identities are memes that have 'contractual' obligations to the hosts. memetic information follows the path of least resistance. lazy memes have an edge over hard to digest memes. you don't have to be aware of memes for them to spread. they just have to spread. it can happen unconsciously. memes only exist as patterns of information on top of hosts. as long as the hosts have memory of them, and they can spread to other individuals, then natural selection applies. if you could take all memes that are in circulation in your brain inside a computer simulation, you would emerge out of it a copy of you that is what you are, a self sustaining pattern. you need them, and they need you. you are the collection of all memes traversing that space. memes can also be replicated inside your thoughts. no need to speak or write to anyone. you remember the last time you thought of something, not the first time you recorded it. you have to keep a thoguth streak alive to keep a meme alive. that's how memory works, it is chained. some hosts are 'democratic', and some are 'dictatorial' with their memes. depending if there are very few memes that are in control of the circulation of all the rest. natural selection is a good model for growth if you can apply selective pressure on your memes. war of ideas is beneficial for you the living being. the things i am talking about are still a meme, they are part of meta memetics memes that spread awareness about the existence of memes memetics is not pseudoscience, it's a soft science just like sociology and anthropology . right now, the field is too chaotic to have accurate predictions. the mechanisms underlying it are scientific. i am not talking here about magic, metaphysics, telepathy, or other bullshit. there are memetic effects to any piece of language, and any sensory information that interacts with you. be aware of them. memetic awareness is useful for altering the effects of the memes on the host, and for developing immunity. memetics are based on replicators, which have 3 traits. copying fidelity fuzziness fecundity rate of copy longevity stickiness memes have high rate of copy, but low stickiness and copying fidelity compared to genes and other replicators. replicators are general, any pattern applies. this includes viruses, animals, genes, computer viruses, automated spam bots, crystals, bacteria, parasites. you could call them living beings, but that would be a stretch. genes can only be transmitted vertically from parent to child . memes can have horizontal transmission and multiple parenting. memes are parasitic in nature. memes spread in a medium of hosts . the methods and approaches they take in that medium is the memetic vector. adding more sensory inputs increases the impact and strength of the vector. if you want to see domains that follow memetics closely, look at: marketing, politics, advertising, corporations, religions, fashions, language, songs, theories, traditions. memes are incredibly difficult to pinpoint, analyze or delimit. they are constantly morphing, and after few iterations they appear to be original, but they are coming from somewhere, through some information processing. nothing is original. most of what we have, we owe to other sources. you may be smart but you re not self made. when you think about it, you re the product of an education system, a healthcare system, luck, roads, the internet and so much more. memes in the animal world include: sounds, songs of birds, hunting and survival techniques. humans are great hosts for memes. we managed to develop language and culture, to be able to scale our idea processing abilities, and inadvertently we gave power to memes and ideas. the internet has far boosted the strength and reach of memes. memes undergo mutation, variation and recombination. memes compete for the limited space and attention of their hosts. the spreading is biased towards the surviving memes. so what is popular doesn't mean that it's good for the individual, just good for the surviving ideas replication. you can model each meme as having a fitness. the higher the fitness, the better the meme is suited for replication in the environment. the simpler memes tend to be favored. nature follows simplicity, even though the result looks complex. the failure for memes is extinction. the win for memes is replication. the winning scenario is an infinite game. it goes on until the meme dies. memes and genes are two different systems, and they co compete as well. one is much slower and more precise. nature vs nurture. exponentially spreading memes are considered viral. this happens when one host has a chance of spreading the meme upon receival that is self sustaining. you need fierce memes to fight off other memes that are incoming, while keeping the usefulness to the main host. this is called being skeptical. our human impulses and emotions are the first to latch onto memes. you need discipline and guardian memes to help against the information barrage. all memes have side effects. make sure to align the memes you have with positive side effects not just for you, the host, but also for others a formula for fitness based on criteria, for instance: f m r m . a m . t m . e m r retention a assimilation t transmission e expression repetition is everything if you are a meme. if you don't get others to repeat you, you die. this is the life of a meme. keep in mind, memes don't suffer. only hosts can suffer. memetics an evolutionary model of cultural transmission of information patterns from one individual that hosts it to another. things than can be combined to make up memetics: epidemiology, evolutionary science, immunology, linguistics, computer science memetics doesn't care about whether an idea is true or false, good or bad, it just care that it gets spread, indiscriminately of what the meme is. memes can give you a lot of power. better have them as allies, instead of enemies. conclusion: memetics apply and our brains are 'meme machines' and we can be infected by exposure to other memes, and the mechanism of universal darwinism apply to this second replicator of information. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; any input or flaws in this theory would be highly appreciated. i want to be wrong.","memes can be parasites, symbiotic or benign, depending on the effect on the hosts. a parasite is one that infects another. a host is something that spreads information to other people, and it can be beneficial to the host. a meme is a form of information that spreads to others, and is beneficial to them.",i think you're misunderstanding the nature of

t3_a4zd0f," USA should make public colleges free using some existing federal student aid funds : goal: decrease student loan debt amp; financial burdens of existing higher education students at public institutions, make public higher education just as or more financially accessible than it is now, and utilize existing federal funding. consider the following information regarding 2 year college amp; 4 year university education aka highered : the sum of all tutition for public highered is less than either all us federal loan subidies or non loan aid for higher education . source so the us federal government which i will refer to as 'the us' has a means for making highered free at current student attendance admission levels, but choses not to. federal student loans cause perpetually increasing highered tuition costs and the us fed confirmed it therefore, the us can and imo should reallocate either source of student federal funding, or parts of both, to pay off the existing supply of public highered at current growth rates of admitted students given that the growth rate of federal financial aid already exceeds public tuition increases . what appeals to me about this solution? this allows for millions of us students to attend highered for free instead of federal aid being spread so thin that many students must take on student loan debt. approximately half of federal aid would still be leftover to use for people who do not attend public highered, such as going to a private institution. this does not require the us to gather additional revenues by taxes or some other means. this is a us federal solution to a federally created problem. i believe that the solution's benefits far outweigh potential downsides or risks using needs based methods to pay off public tuition, comparable to existing methods used for fafsa loan amp; pell grant federal aid. what about state funding? given that the us would provide some baseline of financial support proportional to current amp; future public ed growth: if states increase their contributions towards their highered institutions, then either the number of students they admit for free can increase or the quality of education can increase. if states contribute less to their highered, then there will be decreases in either the number of students they admit for free or the quality of their education. what about private highered and private trade schools? there would be roughly half of all federal student aid still left over to use for anyone who does not get free tuition from public highered, such as private highered or trade schools. there are a number of public two year colleges who provide trade skills. perhaps some funding could be redirect to that. one way of mitigating lower private highered demand would be to direct all non loan funding to public highered, then still keep federal loans around for private highered and such. how would highered or the us choose who gets to attend public highered for free? my initial thought is that the least disruptive way to do it would be to make it comparable to criteria for currently getting federal financial aid fafsa , which seems largely need based. why do i want my pov to be changed? i hope there is another just as feasible or effective way to make higher ed more accessible amp; decrease student household debt without as much government intervention or highered disruption. i'm just having a hard time finding one that appeals to me. both seem simple from the standpoint of moving numbers around, but i am sure this would be challenged on many fronts: private education, perhaps some banks that give private student loans, and government bureaucracy such as in the department of education whoever runs the loans aid that would be layed off . what other options do you know that can help achieve my stated goals?","i don't think this is a good idea. the problem with this is that it's not a federal problem, it's a state problem. the us is a state, and the states have the power to set their own tuition rates. the federal government has the authority to set the price of education, but the states are the ones that have to pay for it. this is why i think it's important for states to increase their contribution to higher education, and not the","the federal government is not the only source of funding for higher education in the us. the state governments are also heavily subsidizing higher education. the federal government subsidizes a large portion of the cost of tuition at many public colleges and universities, but the state government does not subsidize the rest of it.","the problem with this proposal is that it would almost certainly increase the cost of education for the poorest people in the country, and it would increase the number of people unable to afford to go to college. this would lead to a massive decrease in quality of education in the us, and a decrease in the quality of the economy as a whole.",the problem with this plan is that it would require the federal government to spend a lot of money on the education of people who are already paying for it. this would be a huge

t3_br74om," High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value : in their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. these classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. however, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. literature classes that focus on deep analysis of important texts like shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing i. e. stream of consciousness in 'portrait of an artist as a young man' do not develop readinc writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. they also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand. i believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works i. e. argumentative opinion pieces , or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed us history or general literature courses. since this is a broad statement with caveats, i'll clarify in a list: i am not arguing the classes offer zero value. the concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form 'all education has value'. i acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. i am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the civil war, or the politics of the early 1800s. these topics should be pursed electively. i am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. i believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. i agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but i believe they accomplish their goals more effectively. i admit i may display a stem favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so i am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.","history and literature are two very different subjects. history is focused on historical events, and literature is focused more on literary events. if you are going to teach history, you need to teach it in the same way you would teach math, science, or social studies. the purpose of a history class is to teach students how to think critically about the world around them, not to teach them how to analyze historical events.","high school literature and history courses are designed to teach critical thinking skills and critical thinking. they are not meant to teach you how to think critically about history or literature, but how to critically analyze and analyze the world around you. i would argue that high school history and literature classes are meant to prepare you for the real world, where you will have to deal with real world problems that affect you. for example, if you are a history major, you will need to understand the","history and literature are different subjects because they have different goals. history teaches you to think critically, while literature teaches you how to read, write, analyze, and think critically. history is meant to prepare you for the world we live in today, whereas literature is designed to help you understand the world in the future.","i think the value of high school history courses is to provide students with a better understanding of the world around them. it is important to understand how the world works today, and how it works in the past. it's also important to have a good understanding of how the past works, and why it works the way it does. history courses are a great way for students to get a"
t3_btyc4y," Universal Basic Income is Superior to a Jobs Guarantee : introduction i've been paying a lot of attention to the us 2020 elections, and in particular some of the policies brought forward by the various candidates. two policies in particular that i think are worth examining in more detail are bernie sanders' federal jobs guarantee and andrew yang's ubi i think they are interesting in that they are two solutions to the same problem runaway capitalism but i ultimately think that of the two a universal basic income is the superior solution. i have been a fan of ubi for a while now not sure when i first heard of it, but i liked it since i did , so i admit to some pro ubi bias, and i disliked a job guarantee from the moment i heard of it, so i admit an anti jg bias. in the spirit of epistemic hygiene, i would lay out why i oppose a jobs guarantee, why i think a ubi is counterfactually better i would be light in my pro ubi section because of length , and what could convince me to change my mind. before we begin, i'd like you to take not of the fact that i said 'counterfactually better'. i am not claiming that the status quo is better than a jobs guarantee, but that a universal basic income program is better than a jobs guarantee. to defend a jobs guarantee, it's not sufficient to make the case that warts and all it's superior to the status quo, you must make the case that it's superior to a universal basic income. the world you'd be comparing a jobs guarantee to isn't the status quo but a world with universal basic income. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; why i oppose a federal jobs guarantee. a note on incentives before i lay the case for why i am opposed to a jobs guarantee, i would like to talk about my beliefs regarding incentives as they are central to why i oppose a universal basic income. a defense of these beliefs would be worth it's own post, so i wouldn't lay out the motivation for these beliefs, and would instead just lay out the beliefs themselves. i do not take these beliefs as axiomatic, so it is not fruitless to argue against them though i would prefer you didn't do that as the burden of evidence required for me to meaningfully change my mind on this is much higher , but your efforts would be better served attacking the arguments against a job guarantee directly. that said, these are my beliefs: most humans largely have the same preferences: most of us have the same basic needs: food, shelter, clothing and similar wants: higher status, happiness, happiness for our loved ones, etc. there's variation in specifics e. g different preferences in types of houses, but we do prefer houses generally . most problems in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. systematic bad behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise undesirable behaviour amongst members of the system. it's rarely as a result of personal moral failings of members of the system . as a corollary to the above, most successes in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. systematic good behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise desirable behaviour amongst members of the system. it's rarely as a result of personal moral uprightness of members of the system . from the above, i conclude that the best way to improve complex human systems is to change the extant incentives rather than to change the people involved either by replacement or modifying their utility function directly . if your plan requires people to be especially moral to be effective then it's a shite plan. the desired outcome s should occur even when the individuals involved have no moral personality idiosyncrasies, as a result of the incentives in place. amp;nbsp; the case against a jobs guarantee i am not a gainst a jobs guarantee because of the 'jobs' part, but largely because of the 'guarantee' part. assuming that the 'guarantee' implies that workers can't be fired excluding extraneous circumstances and there's strong job security, a jobs guarantee perverts the incentive structures. it decouples employee productivity from employee compensation, and removes any incentive employees have to be productive at their workplace. without an incentive to be productive, employees would be counterfactually much less productive than they would be under private employment. one could argue that employee productivity is already decoupled from employee compensation, but i would counter that while there isn't a very strong positive correlation between productivity and compensation, the two are largely still correlated. for example, higher productivity may lead to bonuses, promotions, raises, stock options or rise in company valuation for employees who have stock options , more benefits, etc. on the other hand, lower productivity may lead to no bonuses, less benefits, lowered wages, demotions, getting fired. the private sector generally tracks some measure of employee productivity, and it seems to factor into decision making. they are also incentivised to reward higher productivity and punish lower productivity so it's what you would expect. the above leads to a situation in which the average employee in a jobs guarantee program is less productive than a similarly compensated employee in the private sector. this makes the economy less efficient as a whole, and as each jobs guarantee employee is one less private sector employee there is a reduction in overall productivity. furthermore, there are allocative inefficiencies, as employees in jobs programs may not be matched to the most appropriate application of their skills granted this would also occur in the private sector, but a jobs guarantee would exacerbate it further depressing economic output. furthermore, employing several tens of millions of people a number that would only rise as accelerating technological advancement displaces more and more private sector employees has massive bureaucracy. a lot of resources would be expended merely administering all the workers. this giant bureaucracy would likely incentivise systematic inefficiency and lead to even more resource waste. to make matters worse, workers admitted into a jobs guarantee program may find it exceedingly difficult to transition to the private sector federal employees already find transitioning to the private sector difficult, but a jobs guarantee may make this worse due to skill atrophy as a result of the lowered productivity . this creates a class of workers dependent on the government for sustenance. this would make ending the jobs guarantee program difficult in the future as it would lead to significant hardship for tens of millions of people and entrenches the inefficiency. ultimately, this reduces the jobs guarantee program to workfare welfare with a work requirement, like the victorian workhouses . we are left with a ginormous bureaucracy that is woefully inefficient and wastes both the government's resources and workers. to top it all off, workers in a jobs guarantee program are out of luck if they dislike their assigned jobs. however, as they'e dependent on it, they're unlikely to quit. as the dependent population would only continue to grow as more and more people are displaced from the workforce all the above problems would become progressively worse. amp;nbsp; the case for a jobs guarantee the main advantages of a jobs guarantee i see are: 1. cost: it would be less expensive than a universal basic income program. 2. labour: the government gains access to a steady and reliable labour force for various projects like infrastructure development, climate change, etc. the first is a point in a jobs guarantee's favour though it would grow faster than a ubi as each displaced private sector worker is one more jobs guarantee worker . as for the second, a normal jobs program without the guarantee part seems superior all the advantages without many of the disadvantages . as i said before, i am not opposed to jobs programs. ultimately it seems to me that the only advantage of a jobs guarantee over a universal basic income is cost, and i think the benefits of ubi and the disadvantages of a jobs guarantee tip the scale in ubi's favour. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; why i support universal basic income there are many reasons to support universal basic income b 7630162 on its own or as an alternative to a jobs guarantee and i don't really want to rehash here what you can read elsewhere, so i just linked them above, and below i'll formulate the arguments most relevant to me. the ssc article goes into more detail about this if you read only one link above, read that one , but a ubi helps many classes of people that a jobs guarantee does not: disabled, caretakers, parents in my case against a jobs guarantee, i mentioned that a jobs guarantee would likely lead to a reduction in economic output. ubi does the exact opposite. by putting money directly into the hands of everyone, ubi acts as a massive financial stimulus to the economy. most of the people who receive ubi would spend a lot of their extra income, and that money would go to others who would also spend some of the money, so the fiscal multiplier would be high. the increased money in circulation would likely result in a significant increase in economic ouftput. a study by the roosevelt institute on 1,000 mo predicted a permanent 12. 5 rise in gdp after 8 years. furthermore, ubi is likely to increase productivity not only compared to a jobs guarantee world, but also compared to the current one. ubi gives workers financial independence. no longer dependent on their employers government and private sector alike for sustenance they are are free to identify the jobs best suited to their particular skillsets. milton friedman said: 'no one spends another's money as wisely as he spends his own', as a corollary to that i would say: 'no one spends another's labour as wisely as they spend their own'. the financial independence provided by a ubi would drastically reduce the allocative efficiencies that would exist under a jobs guarantee program, and under the current system. this could result in a substantial increase in productivity. this in particular is one of the things that most excites me about a ubi. administering a ubi has relatively very little bureaucracy involved, and much lower administrative costs. so there would be less wastage of resources labour, capital, etc in maintaining a ubi program. admittedly, the monetary cost due to inefficiency in a jobs guarantee program would be offset by the greater expenses in a ubi program, but a ubi also does more, and the administrative workers maintaining the bureaucracy would be free to do more productive work. amp;nbsp; amp;nbsp; how to change my mind i admittedly haven't done much research into jobs guarantees, so i expect that there are things i am wrong on, misunderstanding or whose impact i'm incorrectly estimating. i think it would be easier to shift my mind on a jobs guarantee than on ubi not as much as for incentives, but i am pretty firmly in the pro ubi camp and the burden of evidence required to change that is pretty high so i'll focus on that in this section. i'll be more favourable towards a jobs guarantee if: the 'guarantee' is softer than i believe, and compensation isn't completely decoupled from productivity. there are other incentive structures that i am not aware of in place to maintain productivity. the us government is competent at administering tens of millions of workers, and the bureaucracy involved in administering jobs guarantee workers grows sufficiently sublinearly with the number of workers. the resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than i currently believe. a jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a ubi besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour. amp;nbsp;

t3_d0y94l," Our Society is Facing a Masculinity Crisis : now, before i start off i just want to say, that this is something i have been thinking about for a while. the ideas i am about to express come from both thorough research, and what i have seen personally in my own life. i wanted to bring the idea to reddit because i figured it wast the best place to get a wide variety of responses and opinions in one place. with that being said, let's dive into it. i sincerely believe that current western society is facing a masculinity crisis, and there is no end in sight. male suicide rates are up, enrollment in higher education is down, rates of depression and anxiety are up, while male testosterone levels are the lowest they have been declining steadily for decades. not just this, but there seems to be more and more of 'lost' young men. these are young men who are content to wallow in a sort of 'extended adolescence' filled with video games, pop culture consumption, and a lack of ambition to build a future. i believe the root cause for almost every one of these issues is the negative stereotype that men need to 'figure it out on their own' or 'not ask for help' has become so internalized that men themselves are suffering for it. while encouraging an attitude of self reliance is good for anyone, men are being thrust into the world with no form of guidance or instruction. so many men have no father type figure that they can look to for direction on how to navigate the obstacles of life. this is why people like jordan peterson are so popular. whether you agree with his philosophies or not, he helps to give common sense advice to young men who really need it. jordan peterson helps lay out the steps needed to foster the personal growth necessary when transitioning from a boy to a man. contrary to popular belief, young men and boys do want direction and instruction. however, it must come from someone they look up to and respect. this is why the involvement of older men in younger men's lives is so important. young men need to be presented with a masculine influence that is not only constructive, but obtainable. so much of what it means to be 'masculine' in our modern life is characterized by men outside of the realm of the average joe. to be manly means to be an nfl player, a millionaire on instagram, a rapper surrounded by naked women, or a gun toting badass in whatever recent blockbuster movie. since the vast majority of men will never reach the level of success portrayed by these top men, they have nothing to shoot for. in modern media there is no middle ground between muscular, handsome, womanizing, secret agent, and fat, henpecked, sitcom husband who drinks too much. this is one of the reasons why the character of ron swanson from parks amp; recreation is so popular. he is able to paint a picture of obtainable masculinity that is accessible for the average guy. ron swanson isn't rich, buff, or powerful. yet, he comes off as more 'manly' than almost any other character on television. when women say things like 'i can't find a good man', they are right. it isn't that there aren't men available that would date them, it's that the masculine qualities they desire in a partner are non existent. women desire a partner who has undergone the personal growth that changes a boy into a man. women want a man who has set an unwavering standard for himself and those he brings into his life. they want a man who is taking care of his career, his home, his body, and his personal relationships. not because he has to, but because he wants to. instead they find men in their late 20s who still have the mindset of an 18 year old boy. these are men who even though they might hold down a job, have their own place, and be reasonably functioning members of society, are still nihilistic in their approach to the world. preferring escapism and entertainment to taking charge of their own life. men in 2019 are struggling, and it doesn't benefit anyone to let them fail. to dismiss the idea that half of the population might have problems that are specific to them simply because they have historically been dominant is foolhardy. i look forward to discussing this with you and reading your responses. as always, please be civil and respectful. happy commenting!","i think you're conflating two very different things. first, you seem to have a very narrow view of what it means to be'masculine' in our modern society. i don't think it's fair to say that society is facing a masculinity crisis, but i think that there's a problem in the way you're framing it. the problem isn't that men are suffering from a lack of guidance or instruction, it's that they're suffering from the","i don't think there is a crisis of masculinity in the western world. i think it's more a cultural crisis. i'm not saying that there isn't a crisis, but i think that it's not a crisis in the way you're describing it. the problem isn't that young men are being thrust into the world with no form of guidance or instruction, it's that they're being thrust in the world without any form of instruction. i don't know if you","i think you're missing a few things. first of all, mental health is a social construct, not a biological one. i think there are plenty of studies that show that mental health issues are increasing in men and women, but not in the same way that they are in women. i don't think it's possible to say that all men are suffering from mental health problems because they are content to wallow in a sort of 'extended adolescence' filled with video games","i think you're looking at this the wrong way. i think the problem is not that western society is facing a masculinity crisis. it's that we're viewing it as a problem that needs to be solved. that's not the case. in fact, i think it's the opposite. the problem isn't that men are struggling, it"

t3_bvy2qr," Avengers Endgame did not make sense (SPOILERS) : it is undeniable that avengers: endgame is the most ambitious mcu movie so far it pays great tribute to the previous movies in the franchise and manages to incorporate almost every major character which has appeared in the franchise it is highly entertaining, well choreographed, and visually stunning however, just like every other movie revolving around the concept of time travel, it is full of plot holes in this post, i am not arguing that endgame is a bad movie it is lots of fun! ; i am only arguing that the time travel concept was extremely flawed 1 did the hulk casually discover a way to keep people eternally young ? at the very beginning of their time travel experiments, the hulk accidentally made time 'go through' antman, which first transformed him into a baby, then turned him into an old man, until finally restoring him back to his current age does this mean that now people can use the machine to turn themselves young any time they want to 2 why didn't the avengers start by going back to the past and getting more pim particles ? once captain america and iron man fail their mission to secure the tesseract, they decide to travel back to 1970 and get more pim particles which they can use for extra time travel this begs the question, why didn't they start their mission by doing exactly that the avengers could have easily gone back in time and collected as many pim particles as they want before engaging on their main mission 3 how does time travel in avengers: endgame work exactly ? from the little explanation the movie offers, we can conclude that when you travel through time, you split the timeline of your destination into two timelines; the first is the 'original' timeline, and the second is the new timeline you create via your arrival this prevents the grandfather paradox paradox but raises a lot of other questions for example, once you have created additional timelines, how do you travel back to them do you keep some sort of an ip for each timeline you have visited also, when the avengers go back in time to return the infinity stones, don't they just create new branching 'good' timelines instead of 'fixing' the bad timelines even if we assume that 4 if for some reason time travel does not always split timelines, why don't avengers from different timelines unite and destroy their enemies in each of these timelines ? the young gamora from 2012 already ended up helping the current day avengers in their battle with thanos, but wouldn't things have been easier if there were a few more captain marvels with them 5 what is the deal with nebula bringing the entire army of thanos to a future timeline with just a single pim particle ? sure, thanos' ship was shrunk and then enlarged by nebula upon her arrival, but why didn't the avengers use the same approach to conserve their pim particles also, if they can travel to the future and supposedly go back , why don't they go there, get some advanced weaponry and technology, and use them for battles and research 6 if we have potentially infinitely many alternate timelines, how much should we care about the heroes which have died in some of them ? sure, tony stark and black widow from the main timeline are gone forever, but there are potentially infinitely many living copies of them any character can travel through time and meet their deceased friends whenever they want heroes from other timelines can travel to the current timeline and stay like gamora we can't help but feel that this somehow reduces the emotional impact of tony stark's and black widow's deaths 7 why is old captain america sitting on the bench next to the lake at the end of the movie ? the movie suggests that when captain america traveled back to the past, he decided to stay there and grow old with peggy carter at the end, he somehow ends up on the bench next to the lake as an old man in the same timeline he left however, this is contradictory to the time travel mechanics which were introduced earlier in the movie i hope you manage to change my views at least on a few of the points i have raised above","i don't think avengers: endgame is the most ambitious mcu movie so far it pays great tribute to the previous movies in the franchise it is highly entertaining, well choreographed, and visually stunning however, just like every other movie revolving around the concept of time travel, it is full of plot holes in this post","i think avengers endgame is a good movie. it's the first in a long series of movies to explore the concept of time travel in a way that hasn't been done in the previous movies. it doesn't really make sense, but it's not a bad movie, and i think it's a great movie. i'm not sure what you're looking for, but i'd like to point out that avengers: endgame does have a lot of plot holes","i think avengers: endgame is the most ambitious mcu movie so far it pays great tribute to the franchise and manages to incorporate almost every major character which has appeared in the franchise it is highly entertaining, well choreographed, and visually stunning however, just like every other movie revolving around the concept of time travel, it is full of plot holes in this post","i think it's important to point out that the time travel in avengers: endgame isn't the only aspect of the movie that's flawed. it's not even the most interesting aspect, but it's one of the most well done. there are a lot of plot holes in the movie, but they're all well and good. the main plot holes are in the pacing and character development, not in"

t3_d5j9o8," The abortion debate is based on a logical fallacy : it took me quite a while to come to this conclusion and some of the arguments that i m gonna use to support my claim probably need to be discussed in an entirely different post, but i m gonna just hope that they re not too controversial. first of all, i d like to try summing up about what questions the abortion debate revolves around. how valuable is human life? what is considered a human? how important is bodily autonomy? how valuable is the life of a fetus? basically, first we have to ask ourselves, what qualities determine the value of a living being. i think that most would say that that s intelligence, self awareness, consciousness etc. basically everything that revolves around the mental capacity. if that weren t the measure we use, i d have a hard time thinking of one that doesn t make us humans as valuable as plants for example and i doubt that anyone thinks that we re just as much worth as a mere plant. so when do we consider something a human? in my opinion, conception is where human life begins, but that doesn t automatically make it valuable. since we evaluate value using mental capacity, and a cell does not have it yet, it s not as valuable as an adult for example. what could be considered as valuable though, is the potential to acquire said mental capacity. and now we re at the final question. what s worth more? the potential to acquire traits that we deem as fitting to evaluate the worth of life or the bodily autonomy of a being that has already acquired those traits. value. that s what i ve been talking about this whole time. what is more important? i think that the fallacy lies here. what makes life valuable? what makes death bad? wanna know why we humans perceive death as horrible? that s because during our evolution, the species that didn t have a will to live, simply died out. a random mutation is the sole reason we perceive death as bad. that obviously doesn t make death objectively bad. if, for example, during the course of evolution, due to absurd environmental circumstances, the being that evolved to become a human, were to only gain fertility by killing their parents, then humans today, would perceive killing their parents as totally moral, because those who didn t, simply died out. ideally, random mutations also give the being incredible joy at the thought of getting killed by their offspring, thus nullifying resistence. we find killing our parents horrible, but this species would find it wonderful. logically, these alternate humans, would deem people who didn t enjoy killing their parents as incredibly immoral and assume that they have a mental disease. to sum it up, morality is objective and human life isn t worth anything. therefore, everything is worth the same. this doesn t mean that pedophiles should go unpunished, because that implies that punishing would be bad, but since nothing is objectively bad, it doesn t matter. we humans can keep doing our thing based on our subjective moral system, because there s no real reason why we shouldn t. if my arguments were correct, then there is no right answer to the abortion debate, because bodily autonomy and the life of a fetus are worth nothing and we assess value to them based on the psychological traits that evolution randomly provided us.","the value of a human life begins at conception. there is no such thing as a random mutation. it is the result of thousands of years of evolution, and the only difference between a plant and a human being is the amount of time it takes for it to become a plant. if you want to say that a plant is more valuable than a human, then you need to consider the fact that a human is more likely to have a higher chance of dying than a plant,","i think you're missing the point of the argument. the argument is not that a fetus is more valuable than an adult, but that it is not as valuable as an adult. a fetus does not have the mental capacity to acquire said mental capacity, and therefore does not possess the right to life.","mental health is not the main issue in the abortion debate. it's not the only issue, but it's the most important issue. mental health is just as important as physical health, and it's just as relevant as the physical health of the mother.","i don't think it's morally wrong to abort a fetus, but i don't believe it's moral to abort an unborn child. the fetus is not a person, it's not a part of us, it doesn't belong to us, and we don't have the right to take it away from it."

t3_a3epuv," ""Liberal"" and ""Conservative"" are not opposites, and you can be both a liberal and a conservative at the same time. : firstly, i want to get away from the shorthand definitions of these words and go back to their strict definitions. nowadays in common parlance you would define a conservative as someone who wants low taxes, tough immigration policy, less gun control, etc. and in common parlance a liberal is someone who wants higher taxes, lenient immigration policy, more gun control, etc. but are any of these qualities actually inherent in the root words of 'conservation' and 'liberty'? i say they aren't. in fact, i don't believe they're even on the same spectrum of thought. 'conservatism', going by the root word 'conserve', is to keep things the way they are with no further meddling. this is why environmental conservation means to basically leave nature alone without polluting it with human intervention; you want to keep nature as it is. a political conservative basically wishes for the order of things to remain unchanged. this implies that, no matter what state of affairs the politics are in your area, you are a conservative if you don't want them to change. if a person lives in an area where there are pro choice laws, where there is high taxation on the top earners, a lot of social security, and every other policy that is ideal to what we call 'liberal' politics now, would they not be a conservative if they don't want these things changed? it seems to me that 'progressive' is the true opposite to conservative, not liberal. next, 'liberalism', in its most fundamental foundation definition, is the promotion of liberty. liberty is defined as the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. it seems to me that, going by this definition, a liberal would support lenient immigration law, for example, but not on gun control or high taxation. the two latter examples would be instances of an authority forcing restrictions upon you. support of any regulation that restricts people's lives in some way is definitively anti liberal by the fundamental definition of the word. the actual opposite to liberalism is clearly 'authoritarian', not conservative. so can one be a conservative and a liberal? of course; if you live in a society that is rife with liberty and you like it, you are a liberal. if a movement emerges that wants to change that, and you wish to retain the liberal policies in place, you are a conservative at the same time as being a liberal, because those views are unrelated on a foundational level. but, you cannot be a progressive conservative or an authoritarian liberal, because each of those concepts are polar opposites. in short, 'liberal' and 'conservative' do not oppose one another, even on a political level.","i don't think you understand the meaning of the word 'conservative' and 'liberal. 'conservatism' is to keep things the way they are with no further meddling. 'liberalism' is the protection of liberty, which is to allow people to do what they want as long as it doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights. i don't know about you, but i have a hard time seeing how the two are even on the same spectrum of thought.","i think it's important to distinguish between conservative and liberal. 'conservative' is defined as someone who wants to keep things the way they are with no further meddling.

t3_al2ivj," In the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, divine punishment often falls on individuals not personally responsible : in exodus, the government of egypt, particularly the pharaoh, enslaves and mistreats the israelites. instead of punishing the pharaoh directly, god sends 7 plagues against the people of egypt. even the worst and last plague falls on the pharaoh's first born son, not the pharaoh himself. if god is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, then why does his worldly divine punishment often strike so broadly? why does he kill every man, woman, and child in the entire world other than one selected family with a flood? why burn down entire cities of people, even if no good men were to be found? surely, there were innocent children? most importantly, why must the people of egypt and their slaves other than the israelites pay for the sins of their pharaoh? in the real world, the less fortunate often pay in suffering and blood for the conflicts of the powerful. this is morally reprehensible, but pragmatically often seems unavoidable. i don't see why this has to be the case for divine interventions. frankly, my knowledge of the bible is fairly weak. i would prefer this not to rehash the problem of evil a bunch of threads on cmv already have discussions of that . i would like biblical context that provide evidence that god doesn't coddle the upper class and punish them through the less fortunate. i would appreciate comments discussing personal responsibility and the afterlife, but, to change my view, i think i need discussion of worldly divine intervention or discussion on why my focus on that is misplaced .","if god is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, then why does his worldly divine punishment often strike so broadly? why does he kill every man, woman, and child in the entire world other than one selected family with a flood? why burn down entire cities of people, even if no good men were to be found? surely there were innocent children?","if god is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, then why does he kill every man, woman, and child in the entire world other than one selected family with a flood? why burn down entire cities of people, even if no good men were found? surely, there were innocent children, right?","if god is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, then why does he strike so broadly? the only reason why he strikes so broadly is because he's the only one who has the power to do so. the fact that he can and does punish the less fortunate doesn't mean that he doesn't punish the rich and powerful.","i don't think you understand the nature of god. he's not an omniscience, he's an omnipotent being. he doesn't punish the more fortunate, he punishes those who are less fortunate."

t3_bkqs30," The weariness surrounding vaccinations is political, not medical. : i think it's fairly hard to argue intellectually that vaccines are not one of the best inventions in human history. there is no doubt that humanity is better off because of vaccinations. there is a question in some parts of the world as to whether vaccines should be mandatory, however. in an ideal world, i would see this as a no brainer. those who would purposefully deny their children the preventative treatment they need are surely reprehensible, and the government has a vested interest in attempting to prevent the astronomical costs associated with a disease outbreak. amp; x200b; there is no dispute about the medical benefit of vaccinations, the real problem is with trust and power. mandatory vaccinations require that the public trust the government and trust their intentions. it is all well and good to say that vaccinations are safe, but that really is not a meaningful statement. vaccines are safe so long as they are properly designed, tested, and implemented with safety in mind. it is not always the case that government interventions in the name of health actually exist to improve health. there are numerous cases in history where governments purposefully made their own people sick under the guise of preventative health. governments across the planet have experimented on their own people. canada ran both vaccination experiments and nutrition experiments on the native population without consent, killing people of malnutrition. us health services experimented on patients in guatemala's national mental health hospital ad purposefully infected individuals with stds under the guise of syphilis vaccinations. r 0 r 0 in 1966 henry k. beecher released a publication detailing 22 instances in the united states of unethical experimentation on humans without their consent. and of course, there are more examples that could be given. i think that mandatory vaccinations are wrong because they short circuit the building of trust that governments should be forced to cultivate. there is no good reason to blindly trust a governmental organization that they actually intended to help you medically unless they prove a good track record and attempt to educate their own public. mandating vaccinations is a terrible way to go about public policy because it does not take into account the fact that the people have no reason to believe that a government action is in their best interest. if the goal is for most people to be vaccinated then it must be proven that the vaccinations are worth it, and that the entity administering them is trustworthy. tl;dr: mandatory vaccinations are wrong because they do not allow people to reject the goodwill of those administering the vaccinations. it's essentially saying 'trust me, or else' instead of saying 'trust me and here is why'.","i don't think it's fair to say that mandatory vaccinations are wrong because they short circuit the building of trust that governments should be forced to cultivate. i don't trust the government, but i do trust the people administering the vaccinations. if you don't have trust in the government to administer the vaccines, then you have no reason to trust them.","vaccinations are not mandatory because they do not allow people to reject the goodwill of those administering the vaccinations. they are mandatory because there is no way for the government to convince people not to get vaccinated. the government has a vested interest in preventing an outbreak of a disease, because it is the most efficient way to do so.","the problem with mandatory vaccinations is that they do not allow people to reject the goodwill of those administering the vaccinations. it's not that they don't trust the government, it's that they have no reason to believe that a government action is in their best interest.","vaccines have been around for thousands of years and have been proven safe and effective. the only thing that has changed is that they have become less effective at preventing disease outbreaks. the problem with mandatory vaccinations is not that they are wrong, it's that they do not take into account the fact that the people have no reason to believe that a government action is in their best interest."

t3_bt12b4," I don't think people are born straight or gay. I think its likely that people are somewhat malleable and are conditioned during their formative years to have certain sexual preferences. : i don't think people are born straight or gay. i think its likely that we're all on a spectrum, and during our development, our sexual preferences are influenced by our early experiences. i'll share a little bit about myself. i'm mildly kinky. i've enjoyed kinky sex with past girlfriends, and i think the bdsm aesthetic is hot. i don't think i was born with this proclivity. i think that when i was young, i stumbled upon kinky porn, and this had an influence on me. all of my past relationships have been with women. when i think sexual thoughts, women are the focus. however, i've seen sexualized pictures of men and felt that i can appreciate how they might be seen as attractive. i wonder how my sexual preferences might have been shaped if homosexuality was more encouraged in our society, and i had stumbled upon gay porn when i was young. i think its possible that i could have become bisexual. i'm going to talk about some taboo subjects. i'm sorry if this offends anyone. but, these are my honest thoughts. i've heard that its common for gay men to have sexual experiences with older men when they are younger. i think its possible that these experiences lead many men to develop homosexual feelings. i think we're all born a little bisexual, and we drift towards one side of the spectrum as we develop and have experiences. consider the fact that its more common for women to engage in bisexual acts. is this because women are naturally more bisexual than men? or, is it simply the case that our society is more encouraging of female bisexuality? would there be similar rates of bisexuality among men if male gay sex was more encouraged? in other time periods, gay sex has been more prevalent. this was the case in ancient greece. humorously, the ancient greeks stigmatized being the 'bottom' in a gay relationship. gay sex was fine, as you were on top. this just goes to show how artificial our stigmas are. it also shows how 'normal' sexual behavior changes as our societal norms change. finally, let's talk about the sexual behavior of people in prison. gay sex seems to be relatively common. it would seem that when there are no members of the opposite sex around, its natural for people to begin engaging in homosexual sex. if our sexual preferences are biologically determined, then why do so many straight people seem to become gay in prison? given all these facts, i conclude that our sexual preferences are not set in stone. we are malleable. we're influenced by our culture, our early sexual experiences, and the environment we find ourselves in.","there is evidence to suggest that sexual preferences are influenced by early childhood experiences, but that doesn't mean that we are born with a spectrum of sexual preferences. there is also evidence to support the idea that a person's sexuality is influenced by their environment. for example, there are studies that have shown that people who are gay in prison are more likely to be gay because they have been exposed to the same types of pornography as those who are straight.","i don't think it's possible to be born straight or gay, but i do think it is possible to have a wide range of sexual preferences. if you look at a lot of studies, it seems like there is a strong correlation between early childhood sexual experiences and the development of homosexuality and bisexuality. for example, there are studies that have shown that children who are raised in a religious household are more likely to become homosexual than children raised in an atheist household, and that","i think there are a few problems with this. firstly, it would be very difficult to get people to accept bisexuality in the first place. in the case of gay porn, there is a lot of stigma attached to being gay, and it is not uncommon for people to be ashamed of being gay. it is also very common for people who are gay to be ostracized from the community because of their sexuality. in other words, it is very common to be","i don't think you're born straight or gay. i think it's possible that you were born with this proclivity, but that doesn't mean that it's the only thing that causes it. i'm not sure how to change your view."

'if you cheat on me, never let me find out if you want to stay together. i don't need to know and i understand . justine and i separate. 11. immediately, mary and i start an ill fated, quasi relationship. mostly physical. one night we bang and things change. we share i love you s and soulmate talk. we have only been seeing each other for a week. i was in weird, pink clouds, heart fluttering, high school infatuation love. she separated from fianc . 12. mary starts birth control. i ask her why she needs it because i am 'fixed. ' 'because i may want to have sex with someone besides you. ' i accept with trepidation. 13. mary goes to a friends get together. her friend and her friend's husband and she have engaged in sexually intimate previously while she was with her fianc . 14. i make a decision. i ask mary not to sleep with her friends. she complies saying she wouldn't do that to me because she loves me. i am comforted somewhat and i make a mistake. i backtrack saying: ok, mary, i don t want to control you. you do what you think will make you happy . 15. late at night, she calls me pushing to have phone sex with her. my heart starts racing. i hear her friend in the background. i hear her friend asking her to come back. i hear the sound of vibrating sex toys. i hear mary moan her friend's name. 16. i fell to pieces. i could never get over it. it was always on my mind. like a fool, i asked for details. it hurt but i don't think i would have been able not to know. our future ended that night, but i wouldn't realize it for some time. 17. i told her everything would be ok. she asked me to be exclusive with her the day after. now, the rest of the story is incidental. mary showed me her true self, which made me believe she had a clinical narcissistic personality disorder. it is hard to put into words how it affected me. when i tell people, they always seem as if they feel i am overreacting to typical relationship problems. i will try to delineate some of the behaviors i noticed: she believed she was a narcissist and once told me that even if she was, narcissist are people too and they don't deserve love. she didn t tell her fianc she was moving her children and her to another state until the day of the move so he wouldn t be able to delay her move through the courts. she talked bad about everyone but would respond aggressively when called harsh . any criticism aims at her turned into a war. she once told me that she couldn t say sorry and to please not make her do that. she would always tell me how incredibly honest she was and how she never lied. but she did and i witnessed it. her version of honesty was speaking severely. she always needed attention and was obsessed with the social rank of people she associated with. she didn t seem to care about her effect on others, but she was very touchy about how she was affected. i remember once she didn't go to work for a week and didn't have to report to anyone since she was an out of state salesperson. when she was told she needed to work harder, she lost her mind saying how little she was appreciated at that company. i told her she never even when to work and she didn't talk to me for three days. she often used the silent treatment. she wasn't subject to rules, but everyone else was the worst kind of scum if they tested hers. she was relentless and cold. when we broke up, she harassed my ex wife for days to block her on social media. mary's reason was that she couldn't stop herself from internet snooping. she once hit her kid in front of me which is a huge no go for me . i confronted her in front of the kid, and she left it alone. i wrote down in my journal that she would find something random to get into an argument about later that day. she started the fight while we were in bed, and i showed her my journal where i had written my prediction and she raged and tossed my journal out a window. lastly but not comprehensively, she could never accept any culpability. it was my fault for withdrawing my request she does not sleep with her friends, as it made her sad thinking, i didn't want her, so she sought intimacy to feel wanted. it was her fianc 's fault for not being machiavellian enough to prepare for her doing something underhanded like taking his children to another state. she didn t really cheat on her fianc because she only kissed that one guy, she had sex with a girl and she wasn t bisexual, so it didn't count, she was about to break up with him so the relationship was over anyway, etc. so, since the relationship ended, i have traveled the world and started a new relationship. i finally feel like myself again and i am actually feeling happy. the biggest thing was being able to let someone close to my heart again. well, if you made it this far, perhaps you are willing to finish up. i gave you some background. i tried to explore why i think she was able to hurt me so much from the lens of her just being a mean person; i can't accept self delusion. i feel like i can report this without slant, but could i see a slant if i were off keel? i will maintain my well being regardless of responses here, but tell me: was she truly toxic? was my trauma objectively valid? do i present as just a bitter ex? my answers are: yes. yes. no. i don t like being wrong. i always reach for the truth. even when it will hurt me, so change my view. have i deluded myself?","i think you're basing this all on your own personal experience, and i think it's fair to say that you may not have the best idea of what's best for you, but i'll give it a shot anyway. if you're in a relationship with someone who is a narcissist, and you feel like you can't trust them, that's fine. but that doesn't mean that you have to treat them the same way you did justine. you may","the problem with your view is that it is not based on objective analysis. there are plenty of people out there who think that your ex is trash and your pain was valid. it's not your fault that you feel that way, it's your own fault that your feelings were hurt. you have every right to be hurt, but you have no right to feel like you deserve to feel bad about it.","i agree with you that social media is a good way to be safe, but i disagree that it's the only way. i don't think it's a safe way to keep in touch with people you care about. if you're in a relationship with someone who you don't want to be in contact with, it's likely that you won't be able to stay in touch. it's also possible that you'll run into a situation where you're not in a good","i don't think it's possible to have a healthy relationship with someone who cheats on you, but that doesn't mean you can't have healthy relationships with other people who cheat on you. it just means that you have to be careful about who you trust and when you trust them."
t3_cly60l," People Who Blame Gun Violence of Mental Health Issues Are Wrong : it seems to me like every time there is a mass shooter people blame it on mental health issues insanity . i'd like to start by saying that if you were mentally ill, this would likely deter you from seeking help. in other words if furthers the stigma. with this in mind, we should realize that the stakes on this are actually pretty high because if we go around falsely labeling people then we are actively hurting other people with our stigmas. reason one for this belief: i have never heard of a mass shooter being diagnosed with temporary insanity. it seems like it would be a big deal if they were. now maybe they're diagnosed with some sort of issues, but again, you never hear real diagnoses. if i were to google 'are mass shooters insane? ' i would get thousands of personal opinions from people on the internet who don't have the education to make that judgement. it is simply public opinion that mass shooters must be insane. i am often immediately suspicious of general opinions as a rule because i often find that the truth is much deeper. reason two: you do not have to be insane to shoot a gun or to consider killing someone. people make a conflation all the time. they think that if someone is potentially violent, then they must be insane in some way, but we know that's not always true. we have a profession where that is legitimately what people do. it's called soldier. nobody thinks they're insane for being a soldier or wanting to be a soldier. why do they think it's okay? because it's normal. they're shooting bad guys after all. and there is the reason number two. people can easily be convinced that shooting a bad guy is okay. reason three: it is not considered 'insane' to think other races or other people are 'bad guys'. many of us have the good sense to know that just because someone disagrees with us doesn't mean we are allowed to kill them. however, there have, throughout history, been people who feel the need to do something about things that they consider bad. these people often get labeled as insane, but they're not. they merely think a bad thing is going on, and they want to stop it. the communist revolutionists though this. the nazis felt this. the black panthers thought this. the american revolutionists thought this. every democracy that over threw a king thought this. notice how you probably questioned the sanity of the nazis, but you didn't question the sanity of the american revolutionists. if people get it in their minds that something bad is going on, they often feel the need to do something about it. the only time these people ever get called 'insane' is when they lose. reason four: since sane people fight for a cause, it is unfair to label anyone with a cause as 'insane'. whom is it unfair to? the insane. the insane get this bad rap, and nobody wants to be considered insane. so long as people do things for some sort of reason, so long as they kill people with a justification, then we shouldn't call them insane. now obviously if they are diagnosed that's a different issue. the point is that we casually throw around the word 'insane' as though it were some kind of scapegoat. finally, i'm neither trying to diminish a real problem that we have in our country. there is a mental health issue. i'm merely trying to point out that it can be very damaging to recklessly label people as insane when they were really suffering from bad ideas, not insanity. i'm also not trying to talk about gun control. that's a separate topic.","i don't think it's fair to blame mental health issues for mass shootings. there are a lot of mass shooters who are mentally ill, but i don't see how blaming them on mental illness is a good way to deter them from seeking help. it's not that they are insane, it's that they have a mental illness that makes them a danger to themselves and others. if they were diagnosed with temporary insanity, then they would be more likely to seek help, but","i think you're conflating mental illness with mental health issues. mental illness is more than just a diagnosis of mental illness. it's a spectrum of personality disorders that can lead to violent behavior. someone who is not diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder can be just as likely to be a mass shooter as someone diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here. mental illness and paranoia aren't the same thing. i don't think it's reasonable to say that someone with a mental illness or paranoia should be allowed to commit mass murders because they might be mentally ill. but i think you're conflating mental illness with paranoia. a lot of people with mental illness do not have the same level of paranoia as someone who is not mentally ill, but that doesn't mean they","i think it's important to realize that mental illness is a very real thing. it's a medical condition, but it's not the only one. the nazis were mentally ill, but they weren't the only ones to be diagnosed with mental illness. the american revolutionists were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and they were also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which is a mental illness that can affect the ability to think rationally"

t3_bu5s4p," abortion is murder and should be legal : to start, i m a catholic who would never get an abortion due to an accidental pregnancy. however, there are countless cases where abortion is necessary. if the mother s health is deteriorating due to the pregnancy, abortion is necessary to keep her alive. at that point, the baby can t live on its own, but the mother can, as long as she is no longer pregnant. further, if the child will die upon being born or is brain dead, then an abortion should be performed because pregnancy is dangerous and there s no point in carrying out something that could hurt the mother when there s literally no payoff for having the child because it could never live. if the pregnancy is caused by rape or incest, the emotional toll on the mother could be extremely substantial and no one has the right to declare that a woman be put through that constant pain. i would get an abortion for any of the above reasons. however, other people want to get abortions for accidental pregnancies. they want to get abortions because they can t afford the pregnancy, let alone raising the child. they want to get abortions so they can keep up in a competing field. they want to get abortions so they won t have disabled kids. they want to get abortions simply because they don t want kids. while i personally disagree with doing this, i do not know what their lives are like and cannot accurately judge them. neither can any politician. plenty of murders are legally justified in cases of self defense and i think abortion should be included, because it s practically the definition of self defense. someone is going to seriously harm, kill, or ruin your life, so you have the right to choose to kill them. i m not saying that i like the idea of killing a fetus, but it s justifiable, and laws are supposed to be just.","i'm a catholic who would never get an abortion due to an accidental pregnancy. i think it's important to note that the catholic church does not support abortion in cases of rape, incest, or any other circumstance where the mother's health is in danger.","abortion is not murder. it is a medical procedure that is necessary to save the life of the mother's life. the fetus is not a human being. it does not have a right to live outside of the womb, and therefore cannot be killed.","i don't think abortion should be prevented because of the potential risk or the possibility that the mother could be put into a painful position, even for the mother. i think it should be banned because the fetus is a human being, and it has a right to life. the mother should have the right to decide for herself whether or not she wants to carry a child to term, and if she doesn't want to have a child, she should be free to choose not to","i don't think it's a question of whether or not abortion is a good idea. i think it depends on the circumstances of the woman. if the woman's health is deteriorating due to the pregnancy, abortion is necessary to keep her alive. if she's going to die soon, abortion isn't necessary."
t3_an7nsf," The principles of feminism and trans-gender rights are logically incompatible : hi all, as i understand it, the core principle of feminism is that there is no prescriptive definition of what it means to be a woman. ie. , it is perfectly acceptable for a woman to be more nurturing or more adversarial, more logical or more emotional, a scientist or a stay at home mom, etc. a woman can have whatever qualities she likes. this is the core tenet of the feminist movement. in that sense, there is no 'essence' of what it means to be a woman. or a man, equally. you can be a lumberjack or a ballroom dancer, etc . if this is the case, how can transgender people feel an affinity to a specific gender, if there are actually no definitive characteristics of that gender? this seems to be logically incoherent. if there is no real definition of what a woman is, how can a person feel that they are a woman rather than a man distinct from biological sex ? this seems to suggest that the principles of feminism and transgender rights are rationally incoherent, and cannot be aligned logically. a few possible clauses: 1. pragmatism some theorists have argued that trans people seek to present as a different sex for pragmatic reasons. if their personality is interpreted by the average punter as being more stereotypically 'feminine', they may be interacted with in the way they would prefer by presenting as a woman. however, this approach also seems to be at odds with feminism. it effectively reinforces sexist tropes of what it means to be a man or a woman. the solution would really be to emphasise that people can behave however they wish, regardless of their biological sex. this approach would seem to reconcile the needs of both the feminist and transgender movements and also free up everyone to behave however they wish. it would also avoid the issue of people claiming that they are forced to endorse a counter factual claim, in stating that a biological man is in fact a woman. this issue is a large source of the opposition to transgender discourses. 2. dysphoria: i understand that some trans people feel a deep sense of alienation with their physical bodies. this is often the motive for seeking surgical procedures. however, this would suggest that they feel alienated from their biological sex ie. their physical biological characteristics . this would then seem to be at odds with the idea that trans people are rejecting the social concept of gender, rather than biological sex. it would also only apply to those trans people who do seek extensive surgery. i look forward to hearing people thoughts and getting a more nuanced understanding of the issue :d","feminism is not a philosophy. it is a social movement. the core tenet of feminism is that there is no prescriptive definition of what it means to be a woman, and that it is perfectly acceptable for a woman to be more nurturing or more adversarial, more logical or more emotional, a scientist or a stay at home mom, etc. feminism is a political movement, not a philosophical one.","feminism is a social movement, not a political movement. it's not about equality, it's about equality for women and men, not equality for trans people. there is no reason to believe that feminism and trans rights are logically incompatible.","feminism is a movement of people who identify as both men and women, but who don't identify as men or women. it's not about gender roles, it's about gender identity. the idea that gender is a social construct that has no basis in reality is not at odds with the idea of feminism. you can be a man or a woman, but you can't be a woman. there's nothing inherently wrong with that.","i don't think there is an issue here. i think the issue is that trans people don't feel like they are the same as their biological sex. it's not that they don't identify as the opposite gender, it's that they feel that they are not the same gender as their biologically assigned gender. there is nothing wrong with wanting to be the gender you identify"

t3_crjqmk," Disagreement about mainstream politics should never cause families to collapse, or friendships to end. : examples of this are across the media, such as this writer n 5c17d7bce4b030ed3ed001d0 who hasn't spoken to her entire extended family for two years because her parents campaigned for trump. personally, i know of a friendship which ended because one party transitioned their gender and the other simply couldn't tolerate it. i think most of us have experience of the tension politics can create, and unfortunately it seems to be getting worse and worse. i understand that sometimes a political argument can be the final straw in a relationship which, prior to that argument, has been struggling and tense for a long time. in those situations i don't regard the political disagreement as the cause of the breakdown, but rather a catalyst or tipping point. i'm referring solely to relationships which prior to the discovery of the political tension are strong and reliable. the father who kicks his daughter out because she attended gay pride, and the son who won't see his mother at christmas since he learnt she votes trump. i don't think this behaviour is ever justifiable. it takes someone so committed to their dogma, so brazenly blind to alternative viewpoints, so insolent to any ideas except their own, to happily tear down a beautiful and important human relationship for the sake of minor principle. i think part of the problem is due to the increasing perception that people on the other side of the coin are malicious, or in some way corrupt; people hear differing opinions and assert a character judgement, rather than understanding the reasoning behind it which almost always exists . i know one of the first questions will be what, exactly, 'mainstream' politics is. for the sake of simplicity, let's call democratic and republican party policy 'mainstream'. obviously this definition will change on your location and personal perception, but the spirit of the distinction is clear: unless your friend is saying the government should lynch every ginger person in the country, you shouldn't cut them off and block their social media because of a political view. 99. 99 of us excluding the aforementioned ginger lynchmob have a huge amount more in common than divides us. in the case of families and longterm friendships, this commonality is only accentuated. we shouldn't allow this trend to continue, and check it when it arises in ourselves.","i think it's important to recognize that there is a difference between'mainstream' politics and 'non mainstream' politics. there is no such thing as mainstream politics. it's a set of beliefs and values that are shared by the vast majority of americans. if you want to have a healthy relationship with someone, you have to respect their beliefs. you can't cut them off and block them because of their political beliefs. the only thing you can do is respect their","i think it's important to distinguish between the two. if you're in a family and you disagree with your parents, that's fine, but if you don't want to be friends with them, that doesn't mean you can't be friends. you can still talk to them and still be friends, but you can no longer spend time with them. that's not the same thing as cutting them off and blocking them from social media.","political disagreement is not okay, but it should be a problem. if you cut someone off because of their political beliefs, that's a problem, but that doesn't mean it's okay to cut them off and block them from your social media.","i don't think it's wrong to do it if you don't like it. but i think there's a difference between cutting someone out because of their political views, and cutting them out because they don't agree with your political views. you can't cut someone out of your life because they disagree with you, but you can cut them out of their life because you disagree with them"
t3_b30ukw," A Universal Basic Income (UBI) is not Socialist : there's been a lot of talk recently about universal basic income ubi thanks to us presidential candidate andrew yang. a ubi is essentially giving every citizen a set amount of money each month, like 1000, with no work, income, or ability conditions. this cmv is not to debate the merits of ubi, it is to change my view that this type of program in not socialist. if you want to learn what ubi is see this video: or read this article: income a number of critics have said this type of cash transfer program is socialist because it's an income redistribution. i disagree. a ubi is not socialist for the following reasons. cmv. 1. ubi will not make the the government larger in the long term. sure there will be a short term administrative need to setup and send money to every citizen each month and costs around creating and collecting the taxes to fund it. in the us there is talk of a value added tax vat to pay for the lionshare of ubi, but the costs of simply creating the program, sending checks, and levying a new tax should be temporary. 2. socialism is when the government owns resources and the means of production think nationalizing the oil and gas industry in venezuela though a ubi will need additional taxes like a vat, there is not any aspect of ubi that requires a government take over of companies or resources. in fact, companies must do well for this to work, because their revenue taxes will assist in funding a ubi. 3. the line between socialism and capitalism is quite blurry. technically, police, fire, and military are socialist endeavors, i. e. , the government levying taxes to provide a government service. a ubi is different in that it's not a service, it's a transfer of cash similar to tax crs and social security. if anything, because of it's potential to reduce the need for government services, a basic income is more capitalist than socialist. 4. a ubi is championed by some conservatives like milton friedman, because it is fundamentally about freedom. many other progressive policies are advocating for additional regulation and laws. a ubi is devoid of of this, as people can do what they want with the money, and there is not special conditions to receive it. ubi fundamentally allows more people to participate in our capitalist system how they see fit. i'm at work right now, but will do my best to respond to comments throughout the day and into the evening. i'm open to having my mind changed, but i am a huge fan of ubi. thanks for reading. cmv!",a ubi is a system of social security. it is not a social security program. social security is a social safety net. a ubi would be a social welfare program. the government would not take over the oil and gas industry.,a ubi is not socialist because it is not socialism. socialism is when the government owns resources and the means of production. a ubi does not require the government to take over the production of resources or the use of them.,a ubi is not socialist because it is not a redistribution of wealth. it is a transfer of resources. socialism is when the government owns resources and the means of production and redistributes those resources to the people. this is not socialism. a ubi isn't socialism.,"i don't think it's fair to say that a ubi is socialist because it's an income redistribution. it's not, but it is a basic human right. the problem with a basic income is that it's a way to redistribute wealth to the poorest. that's not socialism, it's capitalism. the only difference is that the poor don't have to work to get that money"
t3_bl8dym," it might be okay for young men to have spaces for more man-to-man mentorship. : i am having trouble articulating this view because it really is opposite of most of my thinking. it was inspired by an article i read on vox about incels and a podcast about that article by the author and other vox staff. i'm unapologetic ally a feminist. i think that one of the primary reasons that women specific spaces are okay while men only spaces are not is because for two ish reasons. first, historically, male only spaces have been used to the detriment of women. usually they area a de jure advantage, such as political spaces where women were legally excludes from participating. sometimes they are de facto advantages, such as excluding women from golf courses or clubhouses where professional and social advantages coalesce around the men able to participate in them. i believe that even when we get rid of de jure gender segregation, most of the de facto advantages exist so, at the least, male only spaces remain suspect even with good intentions, because it's easy to revert to the mean in other words, that they reassume the patriarchal purposes implicitly that used to be, but no longer are, explicit. i'm rethinking this somewhat after reading about incels and hearing the conversation in the podcast. i am the beneficiary of an all women's high school. i really feel like human beings have some need that i can't quite wrap my arms around that requires seeing people 'like them' to succeed. i concede that some of the lines that make people 'like them' are social constructs and are malleable. sexual and gender might be one of these, but i'm not too interested in discussing that at length in this post though i can be convinced it's material enough to require discussion. politics abhors a vacuum, and i think reasoning by analogy applies here. young men today exist in a space where masculinity is being redefined at a speed outpacing everyone's ability to conform to whatever changes occur. looking back on it, i think my primary contention with male only spaces could be redefined where i don't like groups spaces that are male only with the intent of ensuring young men are molded to conform to an older form of masculinity, as opposed to a place where they are encouraged to flourish as adults writ large. i mentioned my high school because no one was teaching me what it meant to be a woman, they were teaching me what it meant to be a well rounded person who could read, write, do math, volunteer, and play sports. so i thought: what if the young men who wandering had found a more constructive place with good role models rather than incel or pua forums? my brother, father, and uncle went to an all men's high school. i won't pretend it was an oasis of male feminists, but i'm not contending that male only spaces will solve gender equality or equity, merely that it will be more constructive and harmful to both men and society. if young people require and benefit from mentorship and guidance and i believe they do then i think they likewise benefit from mentors and spaces devoted to mentoring guiding the specific experiences that are different between generally accepted immutable characteristics, such as race, gender, age and ethnic group. if this is the case, and if young men in particular seem like they really need people to tell them that certain periods of their lives are temporary and will get better, then we should encourage and accept more male specific spaces, with a heavy caution against using these spaces to require conforming to traditionally male qualities and stereotypes. rather, i'm thinking of an area more like what was outlined in this article note i do not like the phrase 'emotional gold digger' and don't endorse it , where men lean on each other for friendship and camaraderie without the toxicity eschewing intimacy and vulnerability accompanying it. i'm not yet convinced for what i feel are obvious concerns. reverting to the aforementioned mean is one of them. it might be that this is a growing pain of a more equal society. these places will be self governing, so without due moderation and leadership they could simply reinforce the very stereotypes i think are damaging. it could likewise reinforce static gender and sexual identities; if one believes these are constructs, then this is wholly unacceptable. maybe this is me acquiescing to a truly damaging force incels and certain 'lone wolf terrorists' because they're scary, and i should hold fast. there are more concerns i have, but i figured i should be honest and say 'this was something i was against. now i'm not so sure. here is why. ' i fear that i'm wrong, but i also haven't read all literature and i'm not a gender theory person so i'm not steeped in a lot of this.","i think it's important to recognize that men only spaces can be used to benefit women in many ways, but i don't think they should be used for the benefit of women. i think it should be a matter of how you define'men only' spaces. it's not just about being male only, it's about creating a space for men to be able to have fun and be a part of a group that doesn't discriminate based on gender. i'm not sure","i think there are a few problems with this. firstly, it's not okay for young men to have spaces for more man to man mentorship. young men are still developing their brains and developing their social skills in a way that is not conducive to being a well rounded person. second, i think it's okay for women to have a place where they can have a safe space to learn about how to be a woman without being judged by men. i don't think","i don't think primary education should be mandatory in public schools. i think it should be optional because it is the best way to teach children how to think critically and critically critically. if you don't want to teach kids how to critically think and critically evaluate their own actions, then that is their choice. it is up to them to decide whether or not they want to do that.","i don't think it's fair to say that men only spaces are detrimental to women because they are de jure sexist. however, i do think it is fair to call them sexist because they tend to treat women differently than men. it's not that women are being treated differently, it's that they are treated differently based on their gender. i don't know about you, but i'm not sure that i"

t3_ckcawz," The Star Wars Sequels are not proper Star Wars films : i was a child when the first star wars film came out, i grew up watching the original star wars films, i was an adult when the prequels came out and i don't really remember another film with the same hype and anticipation as the phantom menace. i know everyone online hated the prequel for years and felt like lucas somehow betrayed the fanbase but like or not, the 6 original star wars films were the work of george lucas, you could see the world building, the spaceships and creatures designs and everything had a star wars vibe, it all came out of lucas' imagination. without lucas simply there is no star wars, the sequels have no soul and they can't compare to the 6 originals. what disney is doing with star wars is like if someone bought 'the beatles' name and started making and releasing songs under this name, no one would accept them as proper the beatles songs because there's no john, paul, george and ringo. so without george lucas there is no star wars.","the prequels are a retelling of the original star wars, not a remake of lucas' work. lucas was the creative force behind the original, and disney is the product of his vision. it's like if someone bought 'the beatles name and started making and releasing songs under this name, no one would accept them as proper the beatles songs because there's no original beatles.","i think the prequels are not proper star wars films because they are not'real' star wars movies. the original star wars was an amalgamation of ideas and plots and characters that came from lucas' imagination. lucas didn't invent the star wars universe, nor did he create the original characters. the only thing that lucas did was write the story, which was done in a way that was meant to be a homage to the source material. the pre","the prequels are a direct result of lucas' creative vision. lucas created the concept and the star wars universe, and it's success is a direct consequence of his vision. the only thing he did wrong was that he made a movie that didn't have the original star wars feel like a prequel to the original. that's not to say he didn't do a good job of it, but it's not a bad thing.","star wars is a great film, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. it's been around for over 50 years, and it's still one of my favorite movies."
t3_cdylfy," The British Constitution is superior to its American equivalent. : having studied both in school now, i have come to this conclusion. it's not a huge, life defining issue, i'm aware, but for the benefit of my education and analytical skills i would like to have this view challenged. here's why i think this: 1 the us constitution is inflexible and has become outdated as a result. the tiny amount of ratified amendments compared to those proposed demonstrates the former, and the latter has been shown through an inability to properly address contentious issues, such as the 2nd amendment. due to the parliamentary sovereignty in the u. k. , the constitution can be easily changed to fit the times, as a simple piece of legislation is required to alter it. 2 elements of the u. s. constitution are too easily abused and have lead to a trend of government overreach since the 'new deal' in the 1930s. an example of this would be the 'necessary and proper' clause, which has seen the number of government departments increase from three originally to 15 now, exponentially increasing the size of the federal government and eroding the power of the states. the opposite trend can be seen to be observed in the u. k. , with the various devolutions to scotland, wales, northern ireland and, to an extent, england, taking power away from central government. the frankly ridiculous use of the commerce clause to justify various regulations is another example of this. 3 the electoral college concentrates power in the hands of large states that can win or lose candidates elections. if a candidate wins most or all of the states with the greatest number of electors available california, texas etc. then they will likely win the election, meaning the votes of those in smaller, more sparsely populated states are mostly irrelevant. in the u. k. there is no direct equivalent to this, as the executive and legislature are fused, but all 650 constituencies return one member of parliament each in a general election. 4 the partisanship in the u. s. supreme court makes it an ineffective check against the power of the other two branches, as, if it is aligned with one or both of them, the government as a whole can essentially do whatever they please. in the u. k. there is a strict rule against judges being politically active for this exact reason, with the supreme court ruling, for example, that the government would have to take the decision to trigger article 50 the article which allowed the u. k. to begin the process of exiting the european union through a vote in parliament, because it was parliament that took the u. k. into the e. u. in the first place. had the supreme court have been biased towards the conservative government, they may have allowed them to simply use their royal prerogative powers to pass the article, which would have been wrong. 5 the 1st amendment allows for absolutely ludicrous sums of money to be spent on elections, which could be far better spent in other areas. in the previous u. k. general election 2017 , all of the parties involved had a combined spend of 39,147,932; in the previous u. s. general election, the spend was 6. 5 billion, an difference of over 16000 . amp; x200b; these are just some of the reasons i could list of off the top of my head. looking forward to your views!","the us constitution is inflexible and has become outdated as a result. the uk constitution is much more flexible than the us constitution. the constitution can be easily changed to fit the times, as a simple piece of legislation is required to alter it. the us supreme court has the power to change the constitution, but it is not as powerful as the u. k. supreme court. the supreme court makes it an ineffective check against the power of the other two branches,",1. the us constitution is inflexible and has become outdated as a result. the u. k. constitution is more flexible and adaptable than the us. 2. the constitution is too easily abused and has lead to a trend of government overreach since the 'new deal' in the 1930s. 3. the electoral college concentrates power in the hands of large states that can win or lose candidates elections. 4. the supreme court makes it an ineffective check against,"the constitution of the united states is much more flexible than the constitution in the uk. the u. s. constitution is based on the constitution of every country in the world. it can be amended to fit the needs of the times, but it is not the same as a constitution of any other country.","the u. s. constitution is a living document. it can be changed to fit the times, as a simple piece of legislation is required to alter it. the us constitution also has the ability to be amended to suit the needs of the times. the u. k. constitution has the power to change it to fit current needs."
t3_baocbm," The legal protections for cops need to be abolished. : excessive force is no doubt a big issue with police in the us. i ve always believed that the primary factors in use of excessive force are: 1. legal protections like the law enforcement bill of right s. a good example is an officer shooting an armed suspect. that officer will not be charged with murder or manslaughter because he is protected from the legal consequences of his actions. this is necessary of course as long as the officer had good reason to believe the suspect was a danger to others. however, these same statutes and union policies make it difficult to prosecute an officer whose actions are unjustified or criminal. we hear about this often when an officer shoots an unarmed person only to receieve paid administrative leave. a possible solution is to limit or even remove these protections. this should cause officers to only use excessive or lethal force in situations that are dangerous such as a hostage situation . to compliment the reduction in protections enjoyed by police, protections for citizens should be expanded. officer s should be required to tell you exactly why you are being detained or arrested. body cameras should be required for all law enforcement and not have the option to be turned off or tampered with by the officer. furthermore, a board of non law enforcement personnel should be established to review cases where excessive force was used. 2. most officers should not have firearms. until recently, i thought that officers without weapons was a dumb idea. the idea in practice works out a lot better than it sounds. like police in the uk, there should be a special class of highly trained officers who are allowed to carry and use weapons. the key here is highly trained. the amount of training some police forces recieve is inadequate. it shows in their lack of restraint and shoot first, ask question s later mentality. an officer who spend s 90 of his time writing citations and responding to shoplifting calls does not need a firearm. a taser and mace is enough. in a scenario where a firearm is necessary, the officer could dispatch armed police. 3. the standards for joining most police forces are bad. a highschool drop out with a ged could become a police officer. i do not want to disparage them for their lack of education, however there is strong evidence which shows that officers with college education are better officers in almost every way. here the effect of higher education on police behavior is a study which shows that college educated officers are much better at their job than those who are not. this explains much of my reasoning. undertrained officers legal protections for excessive use of force firearms is a bad combination and it might be the reason why police brutality is endemic. i know some people will counter and say that the media makes the issue much bigger than it seems and maybe they are right. regardless, even one incident is unacceptable and from my anecdotal experience watching a lot of cops, livepd and random videos on the internet there definitely is a problem with police in the united states. i ve seen many videos where a driver is pulled over for a traffic violation and is rude or argumentative. the officer then uses this as an excuse to use excessive force. this is unacceptable; officers should show a greater level of restraint no matter how angry the suspect makes them. keep in mind that while i do not believe even the majority of officers are like this, i do believe there are bad police out there to make it a problem that needs to be addressed.","i think the biggest problem is that the police force in the united states is woefully under trained and poorly equipped to deal with situations where they are required to use lethal force. the problem is not that there is a lack of trained police officers, it is that there are too many police officers who are not trained to handle situations in a way that is reasonable and reasonable. i'm not sure how you're going to change that. i think the best way to address this is","the legal protections for cops need to be abolished because they are protected from the legal consequences of his actions. the legal protections like the law enforcement bill of right s. are there to protect the officer from liability for his actions, not to prevent them from being sued by the public.","the problem with this is that it would be very difficult for the police force to be properly trained and equipped to deal with these types of situations. they would have to have a lot of extra training in order to be able to properly respond to these situations, and even if they were, they would still have to go through a training course to learn how to use a gun and how to de escalate a situation. this would be a huge burden on the police, and it would","i'm not sure how body cameras would be used in the u. s. police force. i think it would be more effective to have body cameras in all police departments, but i don't think that's going to happen. body cameras wouldn't be able to capture every single detail of every interaction between an officer and a suspect"
t3_aa0m4t,"If What Women Find Attractive is an Acceptable Metric to Gauge Desirability, Then Men’s Should be as well. : the recent rise of the incel community has raised an interesting question. if men must conform to women s standards of attractiveness in order to find a partner, should not the same standard be applied to women? while each woman is different when it comes to what she finds attractive, there is a definite overlap in certain traits that a majority of women find attractive. being in good shape, having a well paying job, partaking in interesting hobbies, and being confident, kind, and emotionally supportive are qualities that a man can work towards to increase his attractiveness to most not all of women. any man that whines about not getting laid while doing nothing but sitting around playing video games and jerking off all day will usually be laughed at, and with good reason. you are not owed the affections of a woman simply for existing . the same can be said of men. while again all men are different, there are general traits that make women more desirable to men. things like physical beauty, being in shape, not having tons of previous sexual partners, and being nurturing and caring are all qualities that will make a woman more attractive to the majority of men not all . however, there seems to be a recent movement that is attempting to shame men for having standards, and also encouraging women not to conform to them. while this may not seem like a bad thing, it reveals a massive double standard wherein one sex s desires in a partner are taken as normal women s and the other sex s desires are taken as oppressive sexist men s . my view is that either both men s and women s desires need to be taken seriously and seem as a biological desire rather than a sexist standard , or, both need to be treated as an outdated mindset. so change my view guys! can t wait to hear from you!","i don't think the incel community is trying to shame men for having unrealistic standards of attractiveness, but rather, i think they are trying to change the way we look at men and women. i'm not saying that men are obligated to conform to women's standards in order to find a partner, but i think it's important to recognize that there is a difference between what women find attractive and what men find attractive. a woman is more likely to find someone attractive if she","i think it's important to note that men and women are different in that they are biologically different. women have different needs and desires, and men have different desires and needs. it's not fair to say that men should conform to women's standards of attractiveness in order to find a partner, because men's needs are different than women's, and it's unfair to assume that women's needs should be the same as men's.","i don't think it's hypocritical because it's not hypocritical, it's just a different way of looking at things. incel culture is not hypocritical in that it puts a lot of emphasis on men's standards of attractiveness in order to find a partner, but it is hypocritical in the same way that any other culture puts an emphasis on women's standards. the only difference is that the incel community is trying to shame men for having standards, and also encouraging women not to","i don't think there is a double standard here. i think you are looking at it the wrong way. it's not that women are expected to conform to men's standards of appearance, it's that they are expected not to conform. you can't expect women to conform if they don't want to."

t3_cifz5g," ""This is 21st century!"" as an argument against oppressive practices is an extremely bad argument : i have seen this so many times. whenever someone says something old and religious and says something puritanical or cultural, many people are like 'c'mon, this is the 21st century! ' the argument seems to say that we live in a modern world where women and me are free, economically, socially, politically, sexually where most people have free speech, where people can date whomever they want, where people can express their sexuality freely, and so on, basically a world of liberal ideas and peace. but this is just not simply true. this argument shows that you think your metropolitan city or your friend circle to be the world and that you are just naive. most of the world population lives in non european and non american countries which are collectivistic, religious and puritanical and orthodox. most people in this world is poor and does not have access to rights, let alone basic amenities. most of the world lives in asia which is collectivistic. 1 7th of the whole world population lives in india which is extremely religious. whether its hinduism or islam or christianity, people follow orthodox religions and most people follow their books religiously. the number of moderate liberal religious people, or atheists and agnostics are relatively low. even people who live in china who are mostly non religious, have extremely traditional and puritanical views about the world. then, you have the entire middle east, which is filled with islamic people who absolutely despise the 'west' and its 'liberalism'. african people also have anti western and anti liberal views. russia is another anti liberal hub. to make things worse, america and certain parts of europe is kind of shifting towards right wing and religious views. many immigrants from middle eastern countries are entering europe and trying to make islamic safe spaces there. in retaliation, many people in europe, usa, canada, etc are desperately trying to 'save their identity' and taking up christianity, which is also an orthodox religion. tl;dr no, 'but this is 21st century! ' doesn't make sense. it doesn't include the fact that over 60 of the world live in asia which is collectivistic and puritanical, that over 80 of the world is religious and orthodox, that more than 50 of the world live in poverty, that there are still religious wars going on in the middle east, in india pak, etc. , that usa and russia still has thousands of nuclear missiles enough to wipe out human race, that the actual number of peaceful and liberal people is way too low even in the 21st century. so, stop using this argument.","i think you're missing the point of the 21st century. the world is a much more diverse place than it has been in the past. there is no reason to think that all of the world's religions are the same. there are many different religions in the world, and some of them are very different from the religions of the 20th century. for example, christianity is a relatively new religion in the western world and is very much alive and well in the","'this is the 21st century!'is not an argument against oppressive practices. it is an argument for freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of expression. it's not a call to abolish oppressive practices, it's an appeal to freedom of thought, expression, and expression.","freedom of speech and freedom of speech are not the same thing as freedom of religion. freedom of expression and expression of ideas is not freedom from religion. it is freedom from government interference in one's personal life. freedom from discrimination based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, national origin, etc. is a right, not a right granted by the government. you can't say that the 21st century is bad in a fundamental sense because it is the 21",the world is not a collectivist society. it's a pluralistic society. that doesn't mean that the world is a place where everyone is treated equally. it just means that the majority of people are treated equally by society.
t3_cysnxm," A simple mandate for business to spend an equal amount of money on salaries to men and women will end gender pay gap. : there is a gap in the earnings of men compared to women source i am not here to discuss the extent of it, whether it is fair or not, or the reasons that might describe it for reasons of non discrimination. those are separate and legitimate discussions. my claim is simple: if the government passes a law that businesses should spend an equal amount of money per person on salaries to men and women, then the earnings gap will go away without any long term damage to the economy. if a company fails to comply to this standard, they will be fined by the amount of money necessary to bring that average to equal for that company, plus an extra fee. the tax money will be paid in terms of compensation to the workers of the gender which is paid below the average. this ensures that the company itself is incentivized to pay equally to all genders. this would not be implemented in one go, so there wouldn't be a freakout day where suddenly cleaners are paid at the same rate as doctors. there will be a transition period of multiple years , during which businesses can adjust their hiring and training practices. some challenges that i've given to myself, and my own responses: what if a company has 10 male lawyers and 10 female cleaners? this only demonstrates that the hiring practices of the company has not been gender inclusive enough. during the transition period, they will be able to hire female lawyers and male cleaners and pay them the appropriate rate so that they wouldn't be fined. what about very small businesses? if they have two employees this doesn't work! correct. there should be a minimum number of employees before this regulation kicks in. there are many employment regulations in the us which only applies to businesses larger than a certain number of people. what about businesses where employees of a certain gender are preferred? imagine strip clubs, barbers or beauty salons if a business believes discrimination on this factor serves a real business purpose, then they should apply for an exemption and the regulation needs to be reasonable with those requests. what if there is a shortage of a certain gender among a profession? say females in tech? the regulation does not say the sum of all salaries paid to men and women at a business must be the same, but only that on average, they should be. so google can have 1000 male and 200 female software engineers, as long as those are paid, on average, the same rate, they are good. what about people who do not identify as male or female? nothing in the regulation makes gender a dichotomy. there can be more than two genders and a similar principle applies.","the problem with this is that it doesn't take into account that there are other factors besides gender. for example, men are more likely to be in the military than women, so they will be paid more. this means that they will have more money to spend on the military. however, they will also have less time to spend in the civilian world, so it will take more time for them to spend that money on civilian work. so the government will have to give them more","the problem with this is that it doesn't address the root causes of the gender pay gap, which is that there are a lot of factors that lead to the wage gap. for example, there is a difference in the amount of time it takes for a man to graduate high school compared to a woman. this gap can be explained by the fact that men are more likely to go to college, while women are less likely to do so. this creates a pay gap because men","i think it's important to understand that the wage gap is more than just a gender pay gap. it's a pay gap between the wages of men and women. there is a wage gap between women and men in the us between the ages of 25 and 35. this means that men are paid less than women, and women are paid more than men. this is a gender wage gap, not an income gap.","the problem with this is that it would be a violation of the equal pay act, which is meant to protect the rights of the individual and the economy as a whole."
t3_avbsdl," Your Sexuality Is A Choice : i understand why this argument is made because if something is not a choice, people typically become more accepting. the only reason i want something like this to be a choice is because it shows humans are 'above' their biology. i know this may sound strange at first but for me i think it's nice to have control over those things. emotions like anger, frustration, sadness, are self destructive and these things occur because of chemicals in your brain. learning to bottle up all your negative emotions is useful while letting the positive ones show are better. mind over matter. i say your sexuality is a choice because there are cases of people changing their sexuality throughout their life. all sexualities are decided with your own mind, not your genetics or biology. many people will say, 'well, who chooses to be gay when they know they will be ostracized by others, who wants that? ' nobody knows you swing that way unless you either a tell someone or b are showing that you in a relationship with another girl when you a girl yourself. i will say that it being a choice isn't relevant when it comes to how people treat you. a common counter argument i see: 'if sexuality were a choice be gay than.

t3_c7metu," Victim impact statements should not be part of sentencing : to give some context, i've always struggled to understand why the impact to victims in a criminal case is relevant to sentencing. lets say for example you have someone who is charged with murder, obviously if they are found guilty they should face the appropriate punishment for their crime. but i don't see why having statements read by family members or friends should impact the severity of the sentence. i think this is especially true of crimes where ill intent was not present, and the emotional impact of a grieving family gets in the way of the suspect getting a fair sentencing hearing. in no way do i want to belittle or disregard what victims and their families go through, but sometimes it may be difficult for them to see beyond their emotions and think of the big picture. perhaps the cause of my view is because i would like to consider the utility of a criminal sentence, not the justice aspect of it. it is very difficult for me to put myself in the shoes of a victim of a crime, but if i saw the perpetrator did not harm me or a family member on purpose, and only due to negligence, i would struggle to give a statement that could further increase the severity of the sentence. if i lost a loved one due to a drunk driving accident or something similar, i don't see how sending the perpetrator to prison would make me feel better in any way at all. in fact, even if i was very angry at that person at the time, within a few months i would likely start to feel sorry for them and even feel guilty about giving a victim impact statement. in summary, i guess i've always felt its smarter to be rational when it comes to sentencing and not allow emotions to get in the way. i just think that decisions, especially those that affect possibly decades of someone's life, should not be impacted by someone's reaction to the event. all this being said, i feel someone impacted by a crime should be allowed to be somehow paid back for the impact that the crime has had on them. i just don't see how sending someone to prison could possibly bring them any joy. i definitely feel that the impacts of crime on their victims more so belong in civil cases than they do in criminal cases. in civil cases, i 100 agree with suing for pain and suffering and other impacts, financially or otherwise.","i think it's important to consider the utility of a criminal sentence, not the justice aspect of it. if you have a family member or friend who lost a loved one to a drunk driving accident, it's more likely that they will feel better about the crime if the perpetrator is punished.","if a person is found guilty of a crime, they should be sentenced to life in prison. if they are found not guilty, then they should face the death penalty. i don't think it's fair to punish them for a crime they didn't commit.","i think it's important for a judge to be able to make a decision based on the facts of the case, not on the emotions of the victim's family and friends. if a family member or friend of a victim of a crime gives a victim impact statement, it's a way of showing that the justice system is fair and just. if the judge can't make a good decision because of the emotion of the family or friend, then it's not fair to punish them","i'm not sure what you're talking about, but i'll try to change your view. i think that it's important to remember that family members and friends of victims of crime can have a huge impact on the sentencing of the accused. for example, if you have a family member who lost a loved one in a car accident, the impact on your life will be enormous, and you will"
