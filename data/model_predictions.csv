 The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions,"as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country."," The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions : as a non

as the tea party.,"the ultimate thing i can tell you is to always approach a subject with the conceptualization of perspective. you start off by assuming that the person you're talking to thinks your wrong, and unless your goal is to prove yourself right, the assumption that the person your talking to is either objectively wrong or unwilling to analyze demonstrable reality should be the option of last resort, and that is the point the conversation ends. imo, a conversation should aim to reach an elevated understanding of the truth for both parties even if one or both participants shift slightly then the conversation could be seen as at least productive. first and foremost, what is your criteria for changing your mind?","i think you're missing the point of republicans and democrats. republicans are not the same as democrats, but democrats are the same. democrats don't care about the economy, they care about social security, healthcare, etc. they are the opposite of democrats and republicans. the only difference between the two parties is that democrats care more about economic issues than social security and healthcare, while republicans care less about immigration and healthcare.","i don't know if this will change your view, but i'm going to try to change your perspective. i'm a liberal, and i don't think it's fair to blame republicans for their actions. i think that they're doing the right thing, but they're also doing the wrong thing. for example, i'm not a conservative, so i can't say that i'm racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish, or foolish. but i do think that there is a difference between being a conservative and being a liberal.","i don't think the tea party has anything to do with racism or sexism. i think the issue is more with the fact that the two parties are so polar opposites. i don't see any reason to believe that they are the same. there are a lot of people who are in favor of the republican party, and i think that's a good thing. however, i think it's important to recognize that both parties are different. the republicans are far more interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. i'm not saying that they're all bad, but i think they are just as bad."
 Killing an innocent life is wrong,"it stemmed from a pro life statement i made. this cmv post is not about abortion. i have always believed that it is just plain wrong. i don't really understand how people could disagree with this. obviously there is the greater good and all that, but i mean just honestly walking up to a person and killing them. i don't understand how it could ever be rationalized to be okay. self defense, saving other lives, etc okay fair. how? please try to cmv. thanks."," Killing an innocent life is wrong : it stemmed from a pro life statement i made. this cmv post is not about abortion. i have always believed that it is just plain wrong. i don't really understand how people could disagree with this. obviously there is the greater good and all that, but i mean just honestly walking up to a person and killing them. i don't understand how it could ever be rationalized to be okay. self defense, saving other lives, etc okay fair. how? please try to cmv. thanks.",i think it's wrong to pull the lever because someone might die.,"if i had to the power to go back in time and kill hitler as an innocent baby, is that morally wrong in your opinion. technically speaking that life is innocent and i would be killing the life.","i don't think it's rational to walk up to a person and kill them. i think it is rational to kill them, but it's also rational to not kill them in self defense. you can't just walk up and kill a person, but you can also kill a fetus.","i'm going to try and convince you that killing an innocent life is wrong, because it's not the same thing as killing a human being. it's the same as saying that killing a person is wrong. if you kill someone, you're not killing them, but you're killing them.",i don't think it's wrong to pull the lever because someone might die. it's just plain wrong.

 god existing would make sense,"the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from? and 2, if god exists why is there so much suffering in the world. well think of it this way, as far as we know, humans are the smartest beings in the universe. even though animals have proven to be intelligent, like dolphins and monkeys, we can t teach them human things. you can t teach a monkey how to write, read, or build a house. they re just not smart enough. my point is we are the monkeys and god is the human. what if god is so powerful that before creation, nothing existed, and he was the one who created time and perception. the 2nd problem is people think that god doesn t care because there are horrible things happening in the world everyday. but a lot of suffering comes from other people s decisions. decisions like murder, abuse, rape, and slavery come from free will. imagine if every time someone was about to sin god stopped them, god would be the helicopter parent that no one would want, this is why god gives free will, because even though everything would be peaceful, it would be slavery. humans have always preferred dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. the problem with many christians is that they take the bible literally. the bible is probably like 55 true because the old testament is older than written language so the only way to spread the information was through words. many hardcore christians are too focused on the details and forget that the morals and point of the stories are what s important. i also believe that some of the bible was corrupted and used to control people and make money, because when people are scared, they re easier to control. i honestly don t care if you re a christian or an atheist because it doesn t effect me at all. but if you can t come up with a reasonable argument to why god doesn t exist then i won t take you seriously. k, thanks for reading now change my mind."," god existing would make sense : the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from?

it means you can believe there is a god but there is no current way to prove it. your view is that it simply makes sense. in essence, you invoke occam's razor: the most likely explanation the correct. the problem with this, is that while a divine ruler is possible or at least not impossible it certainly is not the most likely, in comparison to other ideas. so what do we know? we know the organic components necessary to for life to form namely amino acids were present on archean earth some 3. 5 bya and that these components are themselves formed through inorganic processes. we know certain organisms can self organize and all organisms can replicate sexually or asexually, and that large structures such as galaxies form by rules set forth by the principles of physics to form and unravel. we know evolution can explain forms and behaviors and mechanisms of life of all kinds: from flight in birds and chemical communication in arthropods to immune systems and four chambered hearts. there are explanations for the vast majority of systems both biotic and abiotic on our earth. but then, you also mention intelligence and morality. you also mention the christian god as the god likely orchestrating our reality. let's examine these two. intelligence and morality are both very relative. we consider ourselves the most intelligent animals on earth, but we cannot organize as precisely as an ant colony. we can't echolocate our prey and we can't hunt by smell or hearing. these activities take intelligence, albeit a different kind. but let's isolate to human intelligence. chimpanzees and bonobos are in their stone age. they use the same tools our ancestors homo habilis did: rocks, sticks, grasses. given time, would they reach our 'level'? current studies suggest they could, just as we did. morality is a human construct to be sure, in that we give it a name. but all social animals have rules. wolf packs, lion prides, baboon troops and even flocks of geese follow social constraints to keep the peace in their ideal forms. isn't that what morality is? rules to keep the peace? additionally, if the christian god is the head honcho, why do all human civilizations have a set of moral and ethical rules, even if they were unexposed to the christian god in his entirety? the secular answer is that it makes evolutionary sense to preserve the species. i offer not proof that god is not real, but simply some evidence that it doesn't necessarily 'make the most sense'. that said, it leaves us to wonder who sparked the original organism? or spurred the big bang? i suppose short of god descending to our plane, it remains but an issue of faith. forgot a thing","i think you're missing the point of christianity, which is to say, the existence of god. if you don't believe in god, then you're not a christian. you're a non christian, and if you do, you're an atheist.","i'm going to try to change your view in a few ways. firstly, you seem to be assuming that the universe was created by god. the universe is not created by man, it is created by the universe itself. this is not the case. god created the universe, and he created everything. that is not to say that there is no god. there are plenty of people who believe in god, and there is plenty of evidence to support them. secondly, you are assuming that god doesn't care, which is not true. if god does care, then he doesn't have to care. if he cares, he does not care.","the problem with this view is that it assumes that there is no god, and that all suffering comes from other people's decisions. that is not the case. there is a lot of suffering in the world, but there is also plenty of good and bad suffering. the problem with your view, is that you assume that god doesn't care about all the suffering, but you don't really believe that he does care. you believe that all the bad things that happen in the universe are caused by other people s decisions, and you also believe that no one would want to be a helicopter parent, because that's not true."
 A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice,"this seemed to offend people and i don't get why. and the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. and all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual romantic partners. it's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever. we have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. we tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best. there's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and i don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. and i think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition."," A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice : this seemed to offend people and i don't get why. and the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. and all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual romantic partners. it's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever. we have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. we tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best. there's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and i don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. and i think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition.",i don't think people with gender dysphoria should be allowed to transition.,"yeh the thing is i wouldn't want to take such a treatment. being trans is really crap, but it's who i am. if you took that from me then i'd be someone else. besides, if we actually did manage to produce such a thing, why not instead target it at transphobia and homophobia? if everyone took it and was no longer bigotted at all then surely that would be the better world.",gender dysphoria is a mental illness. it's not something that can be cured by surgery. it can be treated with hormone therapy.,"i don't know if this will change your mind, but i don't think it's a good idea to make a pill to stop gender dysphoria. i'm not sure if this is a good or bad idea.","i don't think it's fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition. i think it would be fair to require people to undergo gender reassignment surgery, and i think that should be allowed."
 Anti-depressants don't cause people to commit suicide or other violent acts.,"especially considering the gun debate raging once again, we're starting to hear the old argument that something is to be done about mental health in america, we need to make sure potential mass shooters get the psychological help they need i personally think this is wrong for a few reasons but i'll save that for another post . seems this is a catch 22. isn't it more likely that the connection between school shooters and being on anti depressants is just that school shooters were all previously mentally ill, and happened to be on anti depressants when they shot up the school? by the way, doesn't it prove that these mass shooters already received mental health attention if they're on anti depressants? i wonder if they have any methodology to prove that connection or if it's just a correlation causation fallacy. we wouldn't blame bread for driving school shooters to do what they do, but high chance that all school shooters ate bread on the day they shot up the school. clearly this isn't by design as it goes completely against the whole idea of the drug, and while i understand that the nature of these drugs means that the brain chemistry is being manipulated, are we to assume that the drug is so loosely designed to the degree that it could inadvertently cause someone to become violent? how would that drug get fda approval? thanks in advance."," Anti-depressants don't cause people to commit suicide or other violent acts. : especially considering the gun debate raging once again, we're starting to hear the old argument that something is to be done about mental health in america, we need to make sure potential mass shooters get the psychological help they need i personally think this is wrong for a few reasons but i'll save that for another post . seems this is a catch 22. isn't it more likely that the connection between school shooters and being on anti depressants is just that school shooters were all previously mentally ill, and happened to be on anti depressants when they shot up the school?

 The minimum wage should be abolished,"it is my view that it does more harm than good to a community by sacrificing the number of jobs available to increase the well being of select individuals. furthermore, i don't think that the government is capable of setting an hourly wage that is 'fair' as fair is subjective and varies wildly by region and by career. if i open a clothing store, and i need to hire a cashier. i should pay said cashier a salary that is representative of the value said cashier brings to me and my store. assume that i can afford to pay the cashier is 30,000 a year about 15 an hour for the value they bring to the store. then that's what i pay the aforementioned cashier. i now have a choice: either i somehow make 10,000 dollars more this year, or i let my cashier go and take over the register myself. as automation technology matures, i may even upgrade to an all digital system. after all, it is impossible for you to do that for each and every small business. and yet, it is my job somehow to now deal with the consequences regardless of how my business is actually doing. in that scenario, the flick of a government pen has legislated away a job. please note: i am in favor of basic income."," The minimum wage should be abolished : it is my view that it does more harm than good to a community by sacrificing the number of jobs available to increase the well being of select individuals. furthermore, i don't think that the government is capable of setting an hourly wage that is 'fair' as fair is subjective and varies wildly by region and by career. if i open a clothing store, and i need to hire a cashier. i should pay said cashier a salary that is representative of the value said cashier brings to me and my store. assume that i can afford to pay the cashier is 30,000 a year about 15 an hour for the value they bring to the store. then that's what i pay the aforementioned cashier. i now have a choice: either i somehow make 10,000 dollars more this year, or i let my cashier go and take over the register myself. as automation technology matures, i may even upgrade to an all digital system. after all, it is impossible for you to do that for each and every small business. and yet, it is my job somehow to now deal with the consequences regardless of how my business is actually doing. in that scenario, the flick of a government pen has legislated away a job. please note: i am in favor of basic income.",I believe that minimum wage is bad for the economy.,"nobody knows the value some individual will bring to your store. all products and services are the outcome of the combined effort of many people. take the manager who makes millions with his decisions. if he dies from an infectious disease because the cleaning women was worrying more about her finances than doing a proper job. her work was essential for the company to run, as is every job that needs to be done. of course there is a huge difference in the bargaining power between low an hight skilled workers an that is the source and only justification for different pay. so there may be many reasons for or against a minimum wage, but the value somebody allegedly brings to your business is not a valid one. in my opinion an ever higher minumum wage would increases domestic demand and reduce inequality, boost the economy untill all capacities are used and only then drive up inflation, the latter would be the signal to stop that sort of evil socialst policies.","i'm going to take a slightly different approach. i'm not going to try to change your view, but i think you're missing the point. basic income is a social contract. it is a contract between the government and the business. it's a contract that states that the business must pay the employee what they earn. if the business can't pay the worker what they earned, then it's not a contract. the government has no right to force the business to pay its employees what it wants, and that's fine. however, if the company can't afford to pay the workers what they're paid, then the government can't force the company to pay them what they want.","i think it depends on what you mean by 'fair'. if you mean that the minimum wage should be abolished, then i don't see how you could argue that it shouldn't be abolished.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'good for the economy', but i think you're missing the point of the minimum wage. it's not about the money, it's about the people who have to pay it. if you're talking about people who can't afford to live on a minimum wage, then you're going to have a hard time getting people to pay a living wage."

 Philosophy is a pointless field of study,"i checked out an introductory book about it from my school library as a teenager, and quickly gave up on it because it seemed boring and irrelevant to life. then i went to university to study english and creative writing, and had to study derrida and lacan and someone else i've forgotten. i found it so frustratingly impossible to engage with their ideas that i ended up dropping english after my first year because i hated it the day i made my mind up about dropping it was when i found myself sitting in a lecture about 'the thingness of things' . now, in the interests of full disclosure, i do have asperger's so maybe that's why i struggle to wrap my head around it. however, i don't generally have much of a problem with abstract ideas or theory of mind if i did i probably wouldn't have been studying english and creative writing at degree level in the first place . which is fine if you're religious, but there's religious studies and theology for that. if you're an atheist as i am, and believe in the big bang and evolution, then the question of why is irrelevant. there is no hidden meaning there. getting beyond the surface and looking deeper is a job for scientists, unpacking atoms and unravelling genomes. there's an assumption that answers can be gained from within, from thinking and writing and reading the essays of other thinkers. while i agree this is a worthy pursuit in terms of expanding one's field of empathy and learning about how other people view things, i don't see how any kind of new development can come of it. innovation requires looking outwards, observing and engaging one's environment. all that introspection can achieve is essentially the kind of thing you find in r showerthoughts re wordings of concepts you already knew, gimmicky novel approaches to the familiar. but it's obviously an ancient and widely studied area, so i presume there must be something more to it that i'm missing. can you shed any light on it?

' it's never safe, driving is not a passive action. 'complacency kills' is a good motto to repeat in your head. i would hate for you to be the person that dies because you drove the same road to work everyday for 8 years but were looking at your phone the day that road crews decided to block off that lane or a tree fell the night before or a dog dashes across the street. you are texting in the slow lane because you are assuming it is safer but in reality the fact that you think that shows that you are becoming too complacent and that makes it all the more dangerous. i'm being tough on you because my gf looked down at her phone for one second and didn't notice that the curb suddenly jutted out so she clipped it and rolled her car over. driving for 8 years at that point, and only going 35 miles an hour on a straight, empty road that she was very familiar with. luckily she was ok but it was certainly life changing for all the wrong reasons.","i live in a country where there is a lot of traffic, and if you don't want to be in the right lane, you're going to have to drive in the left lane. if you want to drive on the left, you have to be able to get around the car in front of you. this means that if you're in the wrong lane, your chances of getting into an accident are very low.","if you don't look at your phone while driving on the highway, there really isn't that much to worry about","i think it depends on the situation. if you are in the slow lane, you have plenty of space between you and the car in front of you, and are being constantly aware of your surroundings, you are being a shitty person putting everybody's lives at risk every time you drive. however, if you're in the fast lane, there is a lot of room between you. there are plenty of spaces between you, but there are also plenty of people in the right lane."
" As a white man, the Sarah Jeong controversy is a nonissue for my demographic.","in my opinion, there are a few reasons why this notion is flawed. 1. as descendants of the perpetrators of almost

with being held accountable for that through humor is kinda the least we can do. i know this is gonna trigger a lot of whining about white guilt cuck and whatnot, and this is a bit of a minor point,

 Lord Farquaad's imperfect rule of DuLoc was nonetheless righteous for its time and his deposition was unjust,"what we have seen of duloc is that it is a cleanly and civil community, a beacon of modernity in a dangerous and backwards medieval time wrought with criminals, beasts, and brutal natural environments. he is the overseer of a relatively safe and burgeoning community, a rare sight given the circumstances. the fact of the matter that many fail to discuss is that fairytale creatures truly have no place in duloc. such fairytale creatures largely fail to be contributing members of society. they cannot pay taxes, they largely cannot work, yet they unfairly reap the rewards of farquaad's administration. additionally, such fairytale creatures, despite their charm, are frequently troublemakers that disturb the peace. the chaos they sow when banished to shrek's swamp serves as a prime example. while he may have overreacted when sentencing shrek to death, his demise by the dragon was uncalled for and a demonstrably better outcome could have easily be obtained."," Lord Farquaad's imperfect rule of DuLoc was nonetheless righteous for its time and his deposition was unjust : what we have seen of duloc is that it is a cleanly and civil community, a beacon of modernity in a dangerous and backwards medieval time wrought with criminals, beasts, and brutal natural environments. he is the overseer of a relatively safe and burgeoning community, a rare sight given the circumstances. the fact of the matter that many fail to discuss is that fairytale creatures truly have no place in duloc. such fairytale creatures largely fail to be contributing members of society. they cannot pay taxes, they largely cannot work, yet they unfairly reap the rewards of farquaad's administration. additionally, such fairytale creatures, despite their charm, are frequently troublemakers that disturb the peace. the chaos they sow when banished to shrek's swamp serves as a prime example. while he may have overreacted when sentencing shrek to death, his demise by the dragon was uncalled for and a demonstrably better outcome could have easily be obtained.",I believe that farquaad did not do a bad thing.,this comment will probably get deleted but i just had to say how great this post was lmao,"i don't think farquaad is a good person. he's a good leader, but he's not the best person in the world. he isn't the best leader, he's the worst leader in the entire world.","the problem with this view is that it assumes that the 'perfect kingdom' was created by the duloc people. this is not the case. it is the result of the fact that farquaad's ruling methods are imperfect. the fact of the matter is that there is no such thing as a perfect kingdom. that is, if there is a perfect world, then the kingdom is not perfect. if there are no perfect worlds, then there's no perfect world.",i think farquaad did not do a bad thing. he did a good thing.
 Some psychiatric drugs should be legalised (be allowed to buy over the counter) to receive without a prescription.,"i am open to listening to different opinions and why this isn t a good idea. i don t mean very serious drugs but things like anti anxiety, anti depression and anti add. i think that these drugs can be traded illegally anyway which means that there is no safety control, and the government does not get money. not everyone can afford to get a diagnosis. not everyone wants to. i, for one, do not wish to go through the official process as its expensive, time consuming and makes me nervous. now, some people might say that these drugs can be abused. we could just make a system where you need a passport id and when you buy the drugs, and your name is entered in the system, and you can only refill after a month. anxiety and ad h d are fairly common problems and quite easy to help with medication. i don t see why i cannot just go to the pharmacy and get something to help me calm down or focus. now some people may bring up side effects or potential murder risks. this is why we would have the system where you can only get monthly refills. and this is why we would only sell lighter drugs in this way. the ones least likely to cause serious side effects. and if you get a side effect?

 Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today.,"this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks."," Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today. : this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks.","I believe that if you are a white person in America, you should be able to identify people who are of a different race.","i see two major problems with your argument. first, you're using the phrase 'not likely' a lot. let's use a different example. your kid is not likely to get shot by a school shooter. when you compare the number of schools that exist in america over 100,000 to the number of school shootings that have taken place less than 500 in 175 years , we can definitively say that it is 'not likely' that your child will be the victim of a school shooting. the thing is, unsurprisingly, this doesn't make people feel better about school shootings. they still happen often enough for it to be something terrifying and abhorrent to most people, and when it does happen, it has long term and wide reaching affects. the whole nation is rocked by it, and the community that it happens in is shaken for years to come. not to mention that the lives of the survivors and of the victim's families are changed forever. all it takes is for one kid to get shot at school for thousands of kids to be afraid to go to school the next day. it's the same thing with racial issues. all it takes is one instance of blatant, public racism for black people everywhere to be afraid. so even if we agree that being the victim of racism isn't likely, is it likely enough to make whole communities afraid? that leads to the second point. racism is not always blatant. it doesn't always happen in a way that makes it clear that it is racism. most examples of racism are subtle. for example, several studies have shown that people with traditionally non white names have a harder time getting a job interview, even when they have the same qualifications as applicants with traditionally white names: since 1989, whites receive on average 36 more callbacks than african americans, and 24 more callbacks than latinos. we observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against african americans over the past 25 years, although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against latinos. so when you say, 'you likely did not get rejected from that job because you are black' we can demonstrate that that isn't true. that doesn't mean that betty in hr is a raging racist who dreams of dawning a klan hood one day. it could be that even she doesn't know why john seems more qualified than hakeem. it's just a gut feeling. the same reason why my grandmother always locked the car doors when we were sitting at a stop light and a black man was waiting to cross the street. she never did that with white men. this kind of subtle racism is the most prevalent, and the hardest to prove as well. i can't prove that your dad was stopped at that store because he was black. but how do you know that it wasn't, and what makes you believe that subtle acts of racial bias aren't as pervasive as people who experience them say they are?","i don't see how you're going to change your view when you say 'racism is not likely to happen.'it's not as if you're saying that it's unlikely to happen, it's just that you're talking about people who have a history of being racist. you're not saying that racism is unlikely, you're just saying that you don't think it's likely that it will happen.","i think you're confusing racism with racism. racism is based on the fact that a person's race is more important than their ability to communicate. if you are black, you are more likely to be discriminated against by a police officer than you are to be attacked by a cop. this is not just racism, it is discrimination against people based on their race. it's discrimination against a group based on race. the only way to change your view is to look at the history of racism in america, and look at it from a different perspective. i think it's important to realize that racism is not the only thing that happens to black people, but it's the only reason that it exists.","i don't think it's a good idea to be able to identify people based on race. i think it should be a good thing to have a database of people who are of the same race as you. for example, if you are a white person in america, you should have a record of who you are. if you were a black person in the u. s. you shouldn't have that record, because it would be a lot harder for you to find someone who is of a different race."
 I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome.,"the title shows my basic premise when it comes to politics. i think people should have no governmental obstacles to stop them from being able to succeed from their own merit. i think that if you are a hard worker, you deserve to be able to work your way to the top, seek out knowledge, and stand above those who weren t able to succeed the way you did. you should be able to work your way from the bottom and get to be a ceo or the president or any other top level position if you work and learn and push yourself to the top. i don t think for instance, having affirmative action programs are a good idea. the way i understand it, they try to push for diversity by for example, if two people both have the same qualifications, or indeed even if one is higher than the other, the one with lower or equal standards could get accepted instead, solely based on their race or other criteria, even if they were less qualified. another example is if you have 3 people in a room, a, b, and c. a earns a lot of money, and gets taxed at a higher rate than both b and c, despite the fact that a works harder than b and c. just because he has more money, that money is redistributed to b and c so they can also get a higher standard of living, even though they didn t work for it like a did. these kinds of ideas i think are counterproductive, especially the more they increase. in my last example for instance, if everyone was to give all their money to d, who then combined all the money and then gave it back to a b and c equally, then you end up with a problem. if a knows their money will just be given back to the b and c anyway, why try and make so much more money? and b and c, why would they try and earn more money if they know that they can just rely on a to get it for them? so now a, b, and c all have less incentive to work, and therefore they all have less money. welfare programs promote this kind of behavior as well. instead if we took it in the complete opposite direction, and they all kept everything they had, then they would all have an incentive to earn more money. a could get richer, and even employ b and c if they were willing to work for a, and b and c would realize that they couldn t just rely on a to get everything for them. they would have to work in order to survive, and would therefore have to earn things for themselves. they all have an incentive to work, and therefore must better themselves to earn things. this principle can be applied to many things, such as speech, wherein the opportunity would be everyone can speak their mind. if b and c decided that they didn t like something that a said, they could simply not associate with him. they could instead speak how they wanted to, and tell a to buzz off, and associate with what they want. if outcome was put into place, and a was not allowed to say those things that b and c didn t like, then b and c would feel more comfortable, but a wouldn t be allowed to express their opinions, and would therefore lead to a less diverse group of opinions and discussions. also, if a was to open a shop and discriminate against gay people for instance, if they all had equal opportunity, then b could open up a shop, and c might decide that they don t like a s policy that much, or perhaps c is gay as well, and decide to go to b. this would rob a of his business, and he would either be forced to change his policy, or lose money because of the customers that didn t like his policy or were refused because of it. if they all had the same outcome, this couldn t happen, but if a was religious, and didn t want to serve these gay people for instance, then it would violate his freedom of religion. i should also mention that i think this is better from a moral standpoint as well, not just a logical standpoint. in the first example, b and c are taking a s money and giving it to themselves just because a earned more than they did. they are taking away a s right to their money. in the second example, b and c are taking away a s right to speak as he chooses. he said something they didn t like or agree with, and said by law, you cannot say that anymore. i should make a distinction that this is different if a said i am going to kill you. that implies he is about to attack you, and you should be able to criminalize that. i m referring to if a said b should die in a fire. that s not nice, but it doesn t imply action. a shouldn t be criminalized for saying something mean. in the third example, b and c are taking away a s right to choose who a gives their service to. no one has a right to someone s services. in this example, the government is forcing a to do something that he doesn t want to do, violating his religious beliefs as well. that is my stance when it comes to politics. change my view!"," I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome. : the title

change my view!","i think everyone should have the right to pursue their own dreams, and not be limited by others.","i wrote this quickly so i apologize if it isn't clear is rushed. i legitimately disagree with some of your claims so i looked through the responses and didn't find any that aligned with my own objections though there are a lot of responses so if you have come across this one already, then i apologize . your thought process is great. you are beginning with a certain simplified worldview and then elaborating based on motivation, taxation, notions of what makes a good society, a good economy etc. the fundamental problem is that your initial simplified worldview is fictional or, at the very least, it does not apply in general circumstances and is thereby of only partial use meaning that you ought to supplement your view with other views when the initial conditions do not hold . i will try to illustrate this in two ways. first, you begin with 3 people in a room, a, b, and c, and you ask us to imagine that a works harder than b and c, and that a thereby earns more money. a is taxed higher and yada yada yada. this is indeed a possible circumstance. but it is not the only possible circumstance. suppose, instead, you have 3 people a, b, and c. they are clones, equal in every way. equally hard working, equally smart, equally qualified etc. there is one job opening available in this room. all three apply. all are equally qualified, but one job cannot be given to three people. accordingly, an arbitrary decision process results in person a obtaining the job. person a now makes a bunch of money and person b and c have none. the inequality in outcome, in this circumstance, is not based on hard work, or skill, determination, merit, intelligence whatever else you want to apply. i propose that the situation i have put forth, is just as relevant to the world as the situation you put forth. but your conclusions do not apply to this new situation. i would go even further though i don't expect you to be convinced by this, and making such an argument isn't essential to making my point in this post and say that the meritocracy is fictional. second, inequality in opportunity is readily apparent in the world today. i was born into a middle class family with disposable income. i was raised in an enriched environment with lots of books, emphasis on education, sports, solid reinforcement etc. not everyone has such opportunities. i have friends who had more opportunity than me. they went to private school, international trips, family members in high ranking positions in notable companies who could get them job placements. i have friends who had fewer opportunities than me. raised by single parents who had to work multiple low paying jobs just to afford rent and food, and thereby couldn't direct as much time money to environmental enrichment. this is obvious not to mention political inequalities in marginalized groups, racial inequalities, sexual, other possible inequalities , but a more general point is worth making here. there is a common tendency illustrated in your own case to suppose that intelligence, hard work, resourcefulness, cleverness, cut throatness etc. are for some reason starting properties, rather than outcomes themselves. that is, you are assuming that 'hard worker' is something that people are born with and that this somehow serves as a starting point for an idealized equality of opportunity world. this is certainly not the case. being a 'hard worker' is as much the outcome of a process as is wealth inequality. is there even such thing is equality of opportunity? two general points in closing. 1. inequality of outcome will facilitate social unrest, if that inequality is sufficiently pronounced. social unrest can be extremely dangerous, and limiting social unrest is a benefit for those with and without power. if in your hypothetical room person b and c could get very pissed off and decide to burn the room down and overthrow the system that allows person a to have inequality of outcome, it may be in person a's best interest to give up some of what he has earned, so as to perpetuate the social conditions in the room that allow him such benefits. 2. there is a silly tendency to attribute social power success to something innate inherent in a person. and this long predates genetics and the notion that genetics determine who you are is generally a very silly claim and widely known to be such among biologists experts think of monarchs who had their inherent social power justified through god and, oddly, those who overthrew those monarchs also had their social power justified through the same god. such appeals to innateness may explain inequalities of outcome though other explanations are possible or may make such inequalities seem inevitable ostensible inevitability is a powerful mechanism of social control . but why does some innate inherent quality justify inequality of outcome? i'm not sure so i bring this up to point that out to you and others. why does innate difference justify inequality of outcome? it seems to me that, in some areas at least we generally do not think this to be the case eg. in democracies today at least in the west we generally allow equal political power to each individual at least as an ideal , regardless of whether the person is a genius or an idiot, wealthy or poor, man or woman, white or black, tall or short.","the problem is that you are assuming that people who work hard have a higher standard of living than people who don't work hard. it's not true that this is the case. there are plenty of people who do not work hard, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a better chance of succeeding.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but let me give you an example. let's say you're a white guy. you work hard, but you have a disability. you can't afford to pay your disability. so you end up with a disability, which means that you have to pay a lot of money to get the disability. now, let's assume that you're white. you've got a disability that you don't need to pay for, and you're not going to be able to afford to support yourself. you're going to have to work harder to get a job, and that means that your disability is going to cost you more money. so, if you're black, you're probably going to get less money, because you're likely to be unable to afford a job that pays you less. and, you know, you probably don't have enough money to support your disability, so you're still going to need to work hard to","the problem with affirmative action is that it creates an incentive for people to do the things they want to do. the problem with this is that there is no incentive for someone to do what they want. for example, if you want a job, you have to work hard to get a job. if you don't want to be a ceo, you can't get a position in the ceo's office. and if you have a job that requires hard work, you're not going to be able to do it."
 Thanos' plan makes no sense when you take economics and policy into account.,"i have to preface this by saying i realize this isn't a serious topic, and i understand it's not an important problem to debate or is it?

2. if you cut half the population, i imagine that would initially cause political chaos, all the jobs needing to be transferred, all the people making moves because certain people are gone. suddenly, 2x the resources are available, but half the people are there to use them. would this not lead to a universe wide baby boom? how would people not want to start wars with other planets for those unused resources? am i supposed to buy the idea that everything will be 2x more readily available and things will just go on as normal?

 The future of humanity is NOT in outer space,"i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system? well, first let's consider our reasons for colonizing these planets in the first place. most of these planets are either too hot or too cold to sustain life, with the most likely exception being mars, venus, and a number of moons, including our own. even so, these planets present incredibly hostile environments; they are home to extreme temperatures, little to no oxygen, and most likely no liquid water whatsoever. there are theories as to how we might be able to terraform these planets, making it possible for humans to survive there, although needless to say that won't be an easy process. while there is little doubt earth is becoming less habitable to humans, the reality is we currently have water, oxygen, food, plant life, and temperatures humans can survive in almost everywhere on the planet. if it is possible to terraform an environment which is as hostile as mars or venus, shouldn't it also be possible to re terraform earth? wouldn't this be much easier, and a much more productive use of our resources? so perhaps we don't need to colonize other planets, but they are still home to a number of resources that we can benefit from here on earth, right? maybe we can simply set up mining stations throughout our solar system, and bring minerals back to earth. the problem with this is that inter planar travel costs a lot of resources as it is. transporting mining equipment and mining staff to another planet, and transporting a significant quantity valuable minerals back to earth would be extremely cost inefficient. admittedly we would also be granted access to entire planets worth of raw materials, so some might argue that the trade off is ultimately worth it, but keep in mind that we would also need to burn enormous amounts of fuel, and since we currently depend primarily on fossil fuels, we most likely wouldn't be able to find anything of comparable value anywhere else in the solar system. remember that we are currently facing the risk of running out of fossil fuels entirely, and that they are, as the name suggests, made of organic material. with this in mind, it is almost impossible that we will find anything like it elsewhere in our solar system. like i said at the beginning, this is a massive bummer, and i truly hope i'm wrong. i do not have a background in science, and there is a good chance i don't know what i'm talking about, so if you are able to change my view, i would be extremely happy. that being said, if i'm right, i believe the scientific community would be better off recognizing this hard truth, and dedicating their resources to something more productive than space travel, such as researching ways to make the earth continue to be inhabitable."," The future of humanity is NOT in outer space : i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system?

 Sex-selective abortions in Western countries should remain legal,"they can cause disastrous demographic shifts, similar to those china and india are seeing in certain regions. this reasoning is not applicable in western countries for several reasons: 1 children of all genders are equally welcome, for the most part. while sexism, homophobia, or transphobia certainly can affect children as they age, parents probably aren't going to select for one sex over the other in significant numbers. 2 parents who are willing to abort a fetus of the wrong gender will probably mistreat that child as he or she ages. if you're committed enough to get a relatively late abortion i. e. at the 18 week range because you want a boy, there's a reasonable chance you won't be a good parent to a daughter you're forced to have. 3 any laws limiting abortion based on gender will disproportionately affect minorities. doctors will assume that the abortion is because of the fetus's sex and deny certain segments of the population care, for fear of breaking the law. moreover, winding back abortion rights is dangerous in today's political climate. cmv!"," Sex-selective abortions in Western countries should remain legal : they can cause disastrous demographic shifts, similar to those china and india are seeing in certain regions. this reasoning is not applicable in western countries for several reasons: 1 children of all genders are equally welcome, for the most part. while sexism, homophobia, or transphobia certainly can affect children as they age, parents probably aren't going to select for one sex over the other in significant numbers. 2 parents who are willing to abort a fetus of the wrong gender will probably mistreat that child as he or she ages. if you're committed enough to get a relatively late abortion i. e. at the 18 week range because you want a boy, there's a reasonable chance you won't be a good parent to a daughter you're forced to have. 3 any laws limiting abortion based on gender will disproportionately affect minorities. doctors will assume that the abortion is because of the fetus's sex and deny certain segments of the population care, for fear of breaking the law. moreover, winding back abortion rights is dangerous in today's political climate. cmv!",Laws restricting abortion based on gender are wrong.,point 1 contradicts both point 2 and the conclusion itself. if children of all genders are equally welcome then there should be no need for sex selective abortions.,"i'm not sure what your view is, but i'd like to point out that a lot of people don't have the same views as you. for example, i don't think it's fair to say that women are more likely to have an abortion than men, and i think that's because they're less likely to want to have a child of their own. i'm not saying that women shouldn't be allowed to have abortions, but it's also not fair to assume that women should be able to have sex with their partners.","i would argue that sex selective abortions are a good idea because they reduce the number of unwanted children. however, i would also argue that they are a bad idea because it will lead to more unwanted children being born to people of the opposite sex. for example, if i had a child of the same sex, it would be more likely to be born to a man than to a woman of the other sex.","i don't think it's wrong to have laws restricting abortion based on gender, but i think it is wrong to restrict abortions based on sex. for example, if you have a baby of the wrong sex, you shouldn't be able to abort it. you can't force someone to have an abortion, but you can force someone else to do it."

 Weed is bad for you. Smoking it has many short and long term consequences.,"everyone likes to argue that it's not as bad as other drugs but it still can be very psychologically addictive and damaging. smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes which society has agreed are bad for you so why does everyone pretend that this is ok? everyday it seems i can find new studies that have more and more downsides to marijuana smoke in the short and long term and i just don't understand why people seem to think that there are no downsides here. medicinally it still is considered to have no medical benefits and i don't really see how it possibly could as current understanding of thc which is the strongest known cannabinoid in marijuana seems to cause more harm then good. i can understand that cbd is being shown to be successful in treating things like chronic pain and anxiety however thc vastly outnumbers cbd in weed and smoking to get these effects seems counterproductive. i feel as if medical marijuana companies are trying to piggyback off the false notion that it's a harmless drug and push it onto people asap similarly to how tobacco companies operated back in the day. at the end of the day these companies are profitable off addiction and they have ulterior motives when it comes to testing this stuff. they say things like it's not as bad as alcohol or tobacco cigarette but to me this seems like a logical fallacy as one could really justify any reckless behavior this way. one of the main reasons i've been so torn up on this lately is that a lot of my friends including my girlfriend started smoking and have definitely changed. it bothers me. it bothers me that they started presumingly under age and were not fully aware of the consequences and now a lot seem to have dependencies on the drug. they claim it's fine but in my eyes it's the same as smoking as cigarette, at least in the physical sense, and if people smoke tobacco to unwind most people would agree that it's very unhealthy to form habits around that. at the end of the day, smoking every once in a while won't kill you in the same way occasionally smoking a cig won't kill you, however i believe that having a dependency on anything is not healthy and weed is no exception."," Weed is bad for you.

article to another person? but why link a 2007 article over the newest one? although it does have similarity to the other article with cons. it newly states that marijuana has never been proved to be linked to lung cancer, and that a link hasnt been found. they say thats due to limited time for research. because its illegal on a federal lvl research is hard to come by until recently. it also states that in animal research there are things in marijuana that might actually fight tumor growth, but further research is needed. and people have actually used weed to help cancer. which supposedly worked in this young child, that was given suppliments to try to fight cancer. i would link this but im drunk and jus chillin and its gonna take awhile. i dont think weed cures cancer, especially if you smoke it, but i think its possible that it did something to help this girl. i personally only use a vaporizer, and drink very rarely. heres the part where i kinda support part of your argument, weed can be very addictive and is totally a gateway drug. although the other than weed and alcohol iv just tried xanax ones or twice. xanax is powerful, dangerous, not in a psychedelic way, but in a ruins your life and you forget everything tired depressed way. but ever since iv started smoking weed the habit only gets bigger, now its pretty much daily, every night before i go to sleep i always chill w a quick smoke, always vaporizing, which release no tar like smoking does. it only heats the thc and cbd to a temperature where it is active, kinda what they do to make weed ready for edibles, before adding it to the mixture. there are many studies showing that the smokes chemicals and tar excretion from vaporizing is significantly less from just regularly smoking weed like in a joint. and when weed is smoked through a water pipe bong some of the tar and carcinogens are removed through the water. i digress, i kinda wish i never started smoking, its a nessesity that i spend a good amount of money on and that makes me happy. i want to do most things high, and pretty much always smoke if i got weed. and i always can get some so i always buy some. i am noted as an extremely intelligent person, weird wording but me and all my siblings have gone to ivy league schools harvard, standford etc i am not trying to flex, but because i started generally young, i feel that smoking weed has limited my potential. i think if i stopped for a long period of time, my great memory would come back, but come on did i ever have a great memory or do i just think i had a better one. sometimes i take a week break to reset tolerance a bit, or if i really need to focus on something, out of weed etc but i always have the intention to start again in a week and always do. its pretty much impossible to break the cycle because why the fuck would i break the cycle. smoking weed is just, great sometimes. its not meth its not coke, but it can really let you appreciate life, especially music. its not too late for me, i hope. i dont fit in with stoners, or dealers. i fit in with smart sober people. when im sober. when im high im just a responsible guy whos tryna smoke because everything fucking sucks. im sorry for the rant, im pretty sure iv been writing this for over around 45 minutes. what if this post was archived or some shit and i just wasted all that fucking time lmfaoooo please nooooo. i wonder if any of this even makes sense. dont start smoking. its not good for you, and in my opinion somehow extremely addictive, without being addictive at all. the analogy i always use is, weeds like pizza for pizza lovers , its good as fuck. its not nicotine, or opiods. it just tastes good, or feels good. and you kinda want it, when your sad, when your happy, when your bored, when your in a great mood. pizza could just make life fucking great if we could eat it all the time without gaining weight. well some people see the possibly negative effects because weight gain is visible but weed abuse isnt. if i could eat pizza all day any day. i truly would cause that shit is great. and although weed so far isnt a gateway drug for me. you'll start w it and move on to something else especially if its offered to you. acid overall isnt horrible, it isnt addictive and most people take it to have a crazy trip extremely rarely, others take it every weekend, but that is the low 1 or less. coke, meth, heroin, crack, are some of the worst most addictive terrible things in the word, they are pure man made chemicals, that fuck up your appearance not really coke but the others yes , and are so extremely addictive that you literally need them. immediatly. while molly mdma and acid are on the safer side. xanax and alcohol are very similar to weed, alcohols more addictive and definetly impairs driving way more than weed. but never drive with any drug in system. xanax is the most addictive and most dangerous. its a legal prescribed medicine that you can overdose on like every thing iv mentioned except weed and it completely changes personality and destroys memory and emotions. i need to stop writing damn. goodnight bro. i hope you read this, please argue w me",i don't think it's a logical fallacy to say that smoking weed is bad for you. i think it is a rational fallacy to claim that smoking marijuana is bad. i don't know where you got that idea from.,"i don't think it's 'bad for you' to say that smoking weed isn't bad for you. i think that you're making the assumption that it's bad for everyone. i don't know if that's the case, but i'm

People with serious facial deformities should get plastic surgery.,"looks aren't everything, but they're a lot. most among us get by with looking pretty average and life is good. some among us are super sexy and life is really good. some among us are below average and life sucks. why? because looks are correlated with happiness and earning potential. zillions of studies prove it, it's more or less not arguable. studies that set out specifically with the intention to disprove it end up coming to similar conclusions with like some sort of an exception like 'but super ugly people sometimes earn more than only moderately ugly people!

 The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive.,"what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies."," The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive. : what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies.",I believe that we should tax the rich and give the money to the poor.,"it increases the price, but not be nearly as much as you apparently think it is and not really a cyclical problem as you've suggested either. basic economic principles means that the government paying x for everyone's college would raise the price of college somewhere between 0 and x depending on the elasticity of supply and demand how consumers and providers choose to respond to price changes . the fact that the government doesn't offer financial aid to everyone is just going to make the price rise that much closer to the 0 end of things. but consumers as a whole will never be worse off if the government offers to pay for some college expenses. suppose widgets sell for 25 and the government comes along and offers everyone a free 10 if they buy a widget, so now it only costs people 15. suppose each person has an internal value for how much they are willing to buy a widget for. people who were willing to pay 25 were already buying widgets. people who aren't willing to pay even 15 will continue to not buy widgets. and anyone paynig between 15 25 will now buy widgets and claim the government money. the widget maker can respond to this in a number of ways. they could start producing more widgets to serve the people who are willing to pay 15 25. or they could raise their prices to up to 35 and get the whole 10 for themselves but get none of the benefit of additional sales. the only case in which they'd probably do the second one is if there is a strictly limited supply and making more just isn't really an option. why can't they raise the price above 35? well they would sell even less than they were originally and that isn't how sellers respond to things. as they make more money per sale they make more, not less. here is a more visual explanation of how the supply and demand curves respond to a subsidy like this one. unless the supply curve is vertical, meaning they just don't respond to changes in price by offering just as many spots no matter the price they can get and no new colleges opening up offering classes either when the price increases , then the consumer will also benefit from the subsidy. the overall price for consumers will be cheaper. but with a selective subsidy you can have some consumers hurt a little . the base price won't increase by as much as if everyone got the subsidy, but for anyone not getting the subsidy, they could end up paying a little more then before the subsidy.","i don't think it's fair to say that the government shouldn't be allowed to do whatever they want with the money they receive. it's not fair to suggest that it should be able to do anything it wants with that money. in fact, it's a bit of a slippery slope. the government is supposed to be the arbiter of what is best for the economy, not the other way around. i don't see how you can say that it's the government's job to do what they want, but it's certainly not the responsibility of the government to make sure that it does what it's supposed to do.",i'm not sure what you mean by 'the government is going to give money to universities at the rate of manner it does is ultimately counterproductive.

support your point at all. this shows that woman prefer nice traits. it shows that some men know woman prefer nice traits and use this to manipulate them. the traits of the prefered man are: the manipulation, exploitation, deceit and flattery of others; a lack of remorse, morality concerns and sensitivity, and cynicism. you do not realise when you are getting manipulated or exploitation. that is the point of them. you do not realised whem you are getting decited. that is the point. this study completly goes agaisnt what you say. the obvious conclusion is that to sleep with women men pretend to be nice guys. they pretend to have nice traits. woman fall for this. because they want nice traits. these men can only keep up the lie so long. after the lie and thus the nice traits stop the relationship stops as well. 9th source: i am going to put this in all caps because i do not understand why you have done this so many times. is it to inflate the number of sources you have so it seems more real? is it because you thought no one would read your sources? this is another source reporting on a source you have already posted. 10th source:this study admits itself that they do not think it is fully complete and they don t want to make conclusions. a key point of narcissism is manipulation. again, bad people pretending to be good people. 11th source: oh great. it starts off with a bloggers opinion. i m going to compeltly ignore the begining on some random person s opinions and skip to where they quote a study. i mean i m sure you won t mind since you didn t even read the sources. the study involves data extracted from the internet. great. no one lies on the internet for attention. no one pretends on the internet. and it was based on web searches, posts, and erotica. that is solid. none of that is exaggerated at all. i mean, when i look into what attracts men i just look up the most popular video on pornhub and conclude that is what all men are attracted to 100 of the time 100 of men. yep. oh, super. the data collected is so vaired that you could draw two completly different conclusions on it. by the way, ted bundy dod recieve letters from a large amount of women read: a couple hundred at most . he was a psychopath. he was manipulative. do we need to talk about what manipulative people do? they don t tell people they are manipulative. wanna know who recieve thousands and thousands and millions of letters and fans? boy bands. all of whom have an uptight, nice, gentleman like attitude. 12th source:1st, are you really really really legitmatly sourcing an anonymous blog post on incels. men who wish cancer on women, men who wish rape on women, men who degrade women and call them feminoids , men who expect sex. shouldn t they, according to you, be recieving sex? they are horribly degrading and disgusting people. shouldn t, according to you, women be falling head over heels for them? why aren t they? 2nd, i am not going to trust an ed out blog post of several studies. that is not a legitmate source. link the actual studies. oh look. look what we have here linked as a source. a source you have already linked stop repeating sources it does not make anything more legitmate. so in conclusion. you only have maybe 5 sources here of different studies. nearly all refute your point since it is about manipulation. the one that isn t about manipulation is about woman worrying about manipulation. do you have any sources that support the point you are making? if not, why do you believe your point despite there being no evidence?","i don't think you're wrong. i think it's important to remember that women are more likely to be sexually attracted to men than to be attracted to women. that being said, i'm not sure if you're aware of the correlation between narcissism and psychopathic behavior. if you don't, you probably don't want to be in a relationship with a sociopath. there are plenty of sociopaths out there that are not sociopaths, and there are many sociopaths who aren't sociopaths either. i don't know if you've ever met someone who is a psychopath, but i'd like to point out that there are a lot of psychopaths out there who are less sociopathic than sociopaths. it's not that they don't exist, it's that they aren't as attractive as sociopaths or psychopaths. sociopaths and psychopaths aren't the only ones who are more attractive to women, but they are still the ones who tend to be more","i don't think women are hardwired to desire violent men and to reject good men. i think it's a combination of two things:1. women are biologically wired to be attracted to violent men. 2. men are biologically programmed to be violent. i don't see how you could argue that women are wired to want violent men, but i think you're missing a few things here. firstly, you seem to be assuming that women aren't wired to desire violence. i'm not sure if that's the case, but it seems to me that you're assuming that men are wired that way. secondly, women are not wired to seek violent men because they don't want to be around them. it's not that women don't like violent men; it's that they're wired that they want to have sex with them. thirdly, i would argue that there are a lot of women who don't find violent men attractive, but that's not necessarily the case.","i'm not sure if you're aware of this, but i think it's important to note that this isn't the first study you've looked at. the study was conducted in 2014, and the results of that study are published in the journal of the american academy of psychology. in this study, the researchers found that women were more likely to be sexually attracted to 'nice' men than men. this is the first time in the history of the study that a woman has been attracted to a 'nice guy'. this is not a new study, but it's the first that has been published in a journal of psychology, and it's not the first one."

 The bible doesn't support capitalism,"when i look at the bible, most of the actions of jesus were very socialistic in nature. he gave free food to the poor, kicked bankers out of the churches, and cured people of diseases free of charge. he even said; 'it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven.

the answer requires acceptance of the premises explained above that:1. this life is not all. 2. this life is the means to an end, which end is joy in the presence of god. 3. god provided a way that all that is unfair in this life can be made right in an eternal perspective. 4. the suffering we experience in this life intimately helps us to grow and progress this progression is essential in an eternal perspective. specifically, depending on which judeo christian religion you ask about children that die, you ll get different answers. here s the answer that makes sense to me given the above premises:children and innocents who suffer and die early in this life will have everything made right in the next life. babies that die go to heaven. in summary, you can reconcile the suffering that takes place in this world and the statement that god loves his children if you believe in the statements above. even if you don t believe in the statements, you can still accept that this is how those who do believe in god reconcile believing that he loves them with the suffering in the world.","i'm not going to attempt to change your view, but i'm going to try to give you an example of a god that has been omnipotent and omniscient. there is no god, no god. if god is omnipotent, then the number of children that died at the hands of another human is still massive.","i think you need to understand that the word 'love' doesn't mean 'love'. it means 'love.'it means the same thing as love, but it's not the same as love.",the number of children that die every year in the world is proof that god exists.

" The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason.","a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident."," The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason. : a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident.","I believe that a senate that is elected in this waywarts the will of the people,","although the eu is not a federation or structured in the same way as the united states, it s certainly reasonable to draw parallels. for the us, each state is partially sovereign, but also a part of the overall federation. they are granted representatives in two ways. one way is weighted based on the population of its member states. that s the house of representatives. the other is based on the virtue of being a state. prior to the creation of the the federal government, each state made a conscious agreement to join based on different contingencies. the more populated states have more of a voice in the federal government. but the less populated states would not have been incentivized to join if their voice was almost entirely drowned out by other states with larger populations. so they came up with the connecticut compromise to make an adjustment so that those less populated states had both representation based on population and the virtue of being a state. now, although again it s not a perfect parallel, 4 countries make up 50 of the population of the eu. if germany, france, uk, and italy had more similar interests than the other 24 and voted solely based on population, they could enact policies that harm the other 86 of member states. the us federal government is set up in a way where this won t happen. more populated states still get louder voices, but the representation of the states is corrected to a fair way that their membership was predicated on. more populous states have their representation corrected downwards, less populated states have their membership corrected upwards, but the rank order of the representation of all states still falls perfectly in line with their population. and they all agreed to this, again due to the weight of their population and the virtue of being a state. it would be entirely unfair to backtrack and revise the structure of representation without giving the delawares and wyomings and north dakotas the choice to leave the federation.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but you seem to be trying to argue that states should have the power to elect the president. i think the problem with this is that states are not the only ones that have the ability to do so. for example, the united states has a very large number of states that have a very small number of senators. the us has a population of 1. 5 million people, so it's hard to say that the us is the only country in the world that has a large population. also, there are a lot of other countries that have smaller populations, so even if the us had a smaller population, it would still have a large amount of power. in addition, the usa has a much smaller population than the us, and the us doesn't have the same number of representatives. so it would be much easier for the us to elect a president who is more representative of the population than it is for a president to be","the senate is designed to represent the interests of the people. it is not designed to be a representative democracy, it is designed for the people of the united states to represent their interests. the senate is not meant to be representative of the population, it's intended to represent all of the states in the country. for example, the dakotas and carolinas were both single states and california were six states, that would have been a huge difference in the composition of the senate.","the senate is not the will of the people. it's the people who have the power to change the laws of the country. the people have the right to make the laws that they want. they have the ability to make laws that are in line with their own interests. if the people don't like the laws, they can't change them."

 Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control. Forgiving this shows lack of self respect.,"i noticed that cheating has been normalized especially with people of color poc in the media and in real life. it's sexist if you ask me. let me first define cheating. cheating is telling your partner you won't be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship, but still doing it. it's not considered cheating to me if it's an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot. also, when talking of relationships, i mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them. i don't want to hear of forced marriages, abusive relationships, or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what i'm thinking about. if the passion has died in your relationship, it is better to break off the relationship. i don't mean divorce though cause i know that involves money and can be messy, but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least. to me, if you cheat that means you don't love your so. if you really love your so and understand the pain it would cause them, you wouldn't consider cheating. if your so is having problems sexually and you cheat, that's basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared. there's also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue. and if it's that big of a deal and unsolvable, you can move on to an open relationship or seperate break up. people who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship and or the emotional support they felt in the relationship. i feel when people take back people who cheat, it's because they don't feel they'll ever find anyone to replace what they had which can be a valid point, but still sad desperate . imo i feel it's a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that. i feel this all makes perfect sense, but it's like the older i get the more people are acting like i'm living in fantasy land. beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women. great men are taking back women who cheat too. what's going on?"," Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control.

people consistently undervalue is that while cheating is a horrible thing to do to a person, it doesn't necessarily disregard the entire history that two people may have shared together. i've seen several older couples that find out one of the people cheated over decades. to be sure, once that knowledge is out, the relationship is forever changed. also note, that there was a huge discrepancy in the two people's understandings of what the relationship was to begin with. one person thought they were both being faithful, the other spent a significant amount of energy hiding some amount of their activities from their partner. once cheating becomes known, the relationship cannot be what it was, because it wasn't what it was claiming to be before that point anyway. to get back to why someone might forgive a cheater and it's ok: have you tried dating people? 90 of the people you will find in the dating pool are just not a good match for you, and a significant portion of those people are just not ready for a meaningful relationship to begin with. comparing that to a partner who cheated, in a simple pros cons format, will often place the cheater on the better side of the comparison, even with the huge 'cheated on me' con. the relationship likely had many positives before the cheating was known, and most of those positives haven't changed. ie: if the partner was worth staying with before the cheating and actively making the subjects life better, then once the cheating is known, they aren't making the subjects life as good as they once were, but it's still a net positive. going back to the older couples, sometimes it just isn't worth it to go back into the dating pool, you simply don't have enough time left in this world for it to be worth it. you might argue that is because they are showing less self respect, but i would argue that is merely accepting the facts of life. the world is what it is and you can do a simple math analysis on how many years it takes to get to a point of trust with a person. clearly, a cheater has ruined a significant amount of trust, especially physical intimacy, but relationships are about a lot more than that, and a truly sorry cheater can spend the rest of their years how many years is that anyway? making it up to their partner. not a very romantic solution, but definitely a situation that favors the forgiver. you mentioned the financial aspects of a relationship, and cheating actually has basically 0 impact on that. i once sat in a psychology class having to write an argument about the phrase 'those who marry for money get all that they deserve' and my only critique on the statement was 'why are the words 'for money' in that sentence? those who marry get all that they deserve, it doesn't matter what your reasons are, if you marry purely for love, you're just as big a fool' maybe the love is gone, maybe they aren't a really big fan of their partner personally, but the financial aspects of the marriage mean their whole life is fairly easy as long as they don't separate, or in some cases, initiate separation. this can, again, be a net positive. sometimes, people are just punishing themselves or whatever by keeping a cheater, but a lot of the time, it's not so much forgiving the cheater for cheating as much as acknowledging that life is just better by keeping them, even though it will never be as good as it might have seemed. that might sound depressing, but i've seen it in action. i've seen someone leave a cheater, only to come back 4 years later because things just weren't working out, and life with a cheater is better than what it was without the cheater. easy decision to make from that perspective. typo's and stuff, at this point i'm done.","i don't think it's fair to say that cheating is bad for the person who cheated. it's not like cheating is a bad thing for the people who cheated, it's just that it's a bad way to live your life. if you don't want to be in a relationship with someone who cheats, then you shouldn't be in that relationship. but if you're in a monogamous relationship, and you want to stay in one, then that's fine, but that's not the same thing as cheating.","i agree with you. however, i think you're missing the point of the argument. the argument is that cheating is a bad thing to do, and that it is morally wrong to do it. that is, if you don't want to be cheated on, you shouldn't be in the relationship. if you want to have sex with someone you love, you should be in a relationship with them, not with someone who doesn't love you.","you are correct that cheating is a terrible thing to do, but you are also correct that it is a bad thing to break up with your partner. however, i don't think it is necessarily better to break off with your so than to continue the relationship with them. if you are a good person, you will be a better person if you don't cheat."
 Senior discounts should not exist,"it may be argued that seniors have less disposable income, but there are plenty of non seniors who are struggling and plenty of seniors who are very well off. i would also separate this from veterans discounts, etc. as veterans did something to benefit our country and deserve a little 'thank you' but i don't see why we owe a discount to the elderly. i understand from my research that business owners find that much of this cohort will not patronize their establishment at all under the standard price, thus the benefit of it to the business owner. i'm not sure if this is totally true, but let's go off that. even so, this practice is unfair to a other patrons who might be struggling financially of any age, and 2 commissioned salespeople tipped waitstaff etc. who see dings in their income due to large amounts of people getting a big percentage off their total due to their senior status."," Senior discounts should not exist : it may be argued that seniors have less disposable income, but there are plenty of non seniors who are struggling and plenty of seniors who are very well off. i would also separate this from veterans discounts, etc. as veterans did something to benefit our country and deserve a little 'thank you' but i don't see why we owe a discount to the elderly. i understand from my research that business owners find that much of this cohort will not patronize their establishment at all under the standard price, thus the benefit of it to the business owner. i'm not sure if this is totally true, but let's go off that. even so, this practice is unfair to a other patrons who might be struggling financially of any age, and 2 commissioned salespeople tipped waitstaff etc. who see dings in their income due to large amounts of people getting a big percentage off their total due to their senior status.",I don't think seniors should get discounts at restaurants.,"looking through the comments it s interesting how many people believe that senior discounts are noble. senior discounts are like any other form of discount, they re there to improve sales. it s marketing. no favors are being done, outside of your random small business that has an owner with a grey haired fetish. arguing against the fairness of senior discounts is arguing against discounts in general.","i think you're missing the point of the service. it's not just about the service, it's about the quality of service. the service is not the same as the service itself. if a service is cheaper, the service will be better. if the service isn't good, then the service won't be as good as it used to be. if it is, then it's a service that is better than the service provided by the service provider. if you don't like service, don't patronize. if your service is good, you should patronize it. if that service is bad, then you shouldn't patronise it.",i don't think it's fair to say that a business shouldn't be able to discriminate based on the demographics of its customers. there are plenty of non seniors who are struggling and plenty of elderly who are very well off. i don't see why we owe a discount to the elderly.,"i'm not sure what you mean by'retarded.'i think it's better to say that you're referring to the elderly, not the disabled. you're talking about people who are younger than you, but who are still in their late 20s and early 30s. i don't think that's a bad thing, but i do think that it's a good thing to give discounts to older people."

" There is no valid reason to act in a moral way.

Capitalism is a better economic system than Socialism,"this is crucial to keep growing a stronger economy and helps goods become cheaper than they would be under a socialist government. my problems

competitive society. i also feel like coal would lose its use if the usa became socialist to preserve the environment. i personally like the use of coal, but that is another topic to discuss. now, to

in the United States.,"the assumption here is that competition keeps society moving, that it s what fuels scientific innovation and all. however, it does not. rather it halts innovation, and we get stuck with shitty versions of technology that could be. for example, part of the cause of the great depression was that goods in the us were being made too well. they lasted too long without needing replacement, so eventually, business halted and people lost their jobs, as a result, goods have to be produced more shittily to keep business up. under capitalism, production requires financial incentive. when there s no financial incentive, things aren t made. then there s imperialism, which is the only logical extension of capitalism. growing capitalism needs more and more markets. it s a self destructive system that will always either fall to shit and be replaced or heavily modified with government safety nets, and when it withstands crumbling of being overthrown, it s maintained through military means or extreme human rights violations. if a society with the technology and infrastructure of somewhere like the us were to transition to a socialist society, education would be far more accessible, as would food and housing empty houses outnumber homeless people here and society would function more efficiently because everyone would have adequate food and shelter, at the very least. then more people would be able to pursue medicine or astronomy or engineering and better society instead of having to work late night retail shifts for years.","i'm not sure what you mean

 The word god shouldn't be used if you can't define it as a being,"words, as always, change in meaning over time, they morph and adapt as people choose to use them. this facet of language is often abused in discussions. this is a reason why it's helpful to banish ambiguous words so that they're forced to be swapped by the full intention behind them instead of the words themselves. however, i'm not of the opinion that we should rely on the dictionary as the tool closing the deal for what the definitions are. i don't have anything against ambiguity and fluidity of meanings however my point is that when two persons want to convey meaning to one another they have to be on the same ground. so here's my point: there's a surging trend these days of calling yourself a believer in god but not being able to qualify it and not accepting any attribute that others want to associate with it. the only attributes those people claim are not really valid in my opinion. for example: god is the starting point of the universe though not agreeing on if he has a mind or not, or any of its will, or any criteria for that matter god is the universe itself same as above, this doesn't tell us anything about it a sort of pantheism but that isn't with a mind or will. from my view i think this is highly confusing. i would call this atheism but those persons would still refer to themselves as theists or deists because they've chosen to keep using the word god. in some cases those persons even adhere to a religion or at least follow a certain set of ways of living, a system of values related to it. maybe this is vague and those persons just don't want to offend anyone. this seems like a weak position to me. is it still a guide of life?

Too Much.,"let me explain what i mean by this. i recently came across an ad for the democratic party in which people in regular clothes held up cardboard placards with the group or cause they were advocating for written on them. women s rights , racial equality , etc. what i found particularly eyecatching was a young man who said, i support the lgbtqa community , or the like. at that statement, i cringed. before i say anything else, i want to mention that i am by no means homophobic i have friends who are gay, how could i possibly be homophobic? i support equality for all, and find it ridiculous that in 2018 we still come to an agreement as a nation what consists a marriage, and what is equality. that said, i believe there is absolutely no need to add the two three new categories to the already wordy phrase, as if trying to say that people who fall under those categories were not already represented with lgbt, and especially q: intersex, asexual, and allies who are heterosexual . i have voiced my concerns in the past about how the term feminist may possibly have an adverse effect because those who are already colored to believe that presently the two sexes are equal enough already are going to reject the term, believing the term to mean what it does not: advocacy for the supremacy of the female gender, above the male. i have since recinded that argument, partly because i believe now that to force society to change certain aspects of revolutionary concepts need to be superlatively termed to give them the attention they need, and partly because i am a man and it s really really difficult to say the above to a well concerning woman. in the case of lgbtqia , i ask again what is gained by the addition of three extra categories? lesbian, gay, and transgender are self explanatory. bisexual i had trouble in the past because as a heterosexual man i could not comprehend why those who are both homo and heterosexual would want a whole different category to describe them in advocacy, but i ve come around to accept the notion that they are different from lgt. i did not exactly know what queer meant until a few years ago when that term was added into the already existing lgbt , and the way it was explained to me was they represent all of those sexual minorities who are neither heterosexual or transgender, a sort of umbrella term to make sure that nobody is left unrepresented. what would the addition of those who are asexual or intersexed, and hetero but supporting address exactly? let me say, in my opinion, what the addition does . it creates further confusion for those who are on the fence about the issues of gender and sex. it makes the group less appealing to stand for if you were already against the movement wait, you re telling me they added another category of people?"," The Term ‘LGBTQIA+’ is Actively Harmful Towards the Cause it Tries to Support Because it Drives Away Potential Supporters for Being...

 I think capitalism favours crony capitalism.,"laws, regulations, subsidies, and so on affect the exchange of private property. politicians therefore are a service that can help private actors in gaining profit. this service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped my mind. unfortunately i don't know what would convince me, but because this cmv is theoretical, i will accept theoretical arguments."," I think capitalism favours crony capitalism. : laws, regulations, subsidies, and so on affect the exchange of private property. politicians therefore are a service that can help private actors in gaining profit. this service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped my mind. unfortunately i don't know what would convince me, but because this cmv is theoretical, i will accept theoretical arguments.",I believe that politicians are just people who can buy votes.,why would investors inject their money into a corrupt market when better markets exist?,"i think you're confusing 'democracy' with 'democracy'. democracy is a system of government that allows the people to vote according to their own interests. if you want to have a representative government, you have to have an elected representative that is able to make decisions on behalf of the people. this means that if you don't vote, you are not going to be able to vote. you are going to have to vote for someone who is going to represent your interests, and you will have to choose between someone who represents your interests and someone who doesn't. this is the same as saying that the government has the right to vote because it is the people's right to do so. it's not the government's job to decide what is best for the people, it's the person's responsibility to make the best decisions for them. the government can't force you to vote, but it can do what it wants to do.","i think you're missing a fundamental part of capitalism, which is that it's not the only thing that can help private actors in gaining profit. it's the fact that there are a lot of things that can benefit private actors, but they don't necessarily have to. for example, if you want to make a movie, you're going to have to pay for it. if you don't, then you're not going to be able to sell it to a movie theater.","i think you have a very narrow view of what it means to be a politician. i think you are assuming that politicians are just people who can buy votes. in fact, it's not that simple. it's that you can't buy votes in any way, shape, form, or form. for example, if you want to buy a car, you can buy a house. if you don't want a house, you are free to buy one. but if you do want to get a house in the first place, you're free to do so. you can get a car in the second place, but you have to buy it in the third place. there's a difference between buying a house and buying a car."

Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law,"my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law : my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.",I think abortion should be 100% legal everywhere.,are miscarriages manslaughter?,"i think it's important to understand that you're talking about people who are pro choice, not those who are anti abortion. it's not that they don't want children, it's that they want them to grow up in a society where they have no control over their own bodies. if you want to be pro life, you have to accept that there are people who don't like abortion, and that people who do are pro life. for example, i'm pro choice because i believe that abortion should be legal, but i also believe that it shouldn't be illegal for people to have an abortion. i think you're confusing pro choice with pro choice. pro choice means that people should be able to choose what they want to do with their bodies, and not be forced to pay for it. i don't think that's a bad thing, but it's a good thing.","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i'm going to take a different approach. roe v wade was a decision that was made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. i think it's important to recognize that the constitution says life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. but that doesn't mean that a fetus is a living thing. it means that the government shouldn't be required to pay for the care of the child. it's not like the government should pay for birth control.","note: your thread has not been removed. your post's topic seems to be fairly common on this subreddit. similar posts can be found through our wiki page or via the search function regards, the mods of r changemyview. i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose? to 2fr 2fchangemyview if you have any questions or concerns.

" Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral","you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter? no matter how real it looks, it isn't . it may look uncomfortable to some people to see what looks like themselves in vulgar scenes, but just because something is uncomfortable to look at to some, does not mean it is inherently immoral. 2. you don't own the image of your face. every day you willingly give it away by walking in public or posting selfies of yourself online. this is especially true for celebrities. it's almost their job to make their appearance as widely known as possible. and even if you don't, you're not entitled to 'own' illustrations of yourself like a copyrighted piece of art anyway, at least not by default. it's human nature for people to remember how other people look and picture them in their heads, even in thoughts such as sexual fantasies. and if that's okay then i don't understand why it's not okay to just copy these thoughts into a tangible format such as an illustration. 3. technology is ever improving, and faked imagery is only going to get more realistic and easy to produce. i'm sure last century there were people equally offended by faked porn that would to our eyes look ridiculously bad and unrealistic. fakes are here to stay, and we need to adapt our sense of morality to reflect this reality. i believe this will happen and such images will get normalized sooner or later either way, but i think it would be in everyone's interest to just get it over with and make it sooner rather than later."," Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral : you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter?

it's awful.","the problem with this is that it's a matter of personal preference. if i want to share a picture of myself with someone else, i have to do so with the consent of the person i'm sharing it with. i don't want them to see my face, but i do want to be able to see what i look like. i want people to know that i'm not the same person as i am. it's not my job to make an image of myself, it's my responsibility to make a photo of myself. if you want me to share your photo with you, then you have to give me permission to share it with others. i'm free to share my photo with anyone who wants to share that photo with me, but that doesn't mean i have the right to do that.","i think it's important to note that this is not a'solution' to just declare it immoral. it's not a solution to a problem, but it is a way to fix it. the problem is that there are two types of 'deepfake' porn. one is 'fake' and the other is'real'. the'real' is 'faked' and 'fakes' are 'fake.'the real is the same as the fake, but the fake is a different story. the real isn't 'fake', it's 'faking'. the fake isn't real, it's fake, and the fake doesn't represent the real person. the fake person isn't pretending to be a real person, they're pretending to look like a fake person.","i don't think it is immoral to use 'deepfakes' or to post them online, but i do think it's immoral to post images of yourself online. i don't know if i can change your view on this, but it seems to me that your view is based on two things:1. the first is that you don't own the image of yourself, and the second is that it is not immoral to share it with others. 2. i think the second point is a bit of a strawman. you are right that it's not immoral for people to share images of themselves in public, but that's not the same as saying that it isn't immoral for someone to post pictures of themselves online. it's just that people don't have the right to do so, and that's fine. 3. the third point is that i think you're conflating two different things. first, you have to define what it means to share an image of"

 4chan’s algorithm for discussion threads is superior to Reddit’s.,"the more people comment on a post, the longer it stays on the front page. i think this is preferable to the upvote downvote system because that means the most contentious and engaged topics are what is seen. too many interesting posts on reddit go unnoticed due to rigorous downvoting. sometimes a publication like national review can put out a very interesting article but it will never be seen on r politics due to the left slant of most of its user base and the barrage of downvotes such a post would receive. if such a post were instead ranked based on interaction rather than voting, i think you d see a more diverse range of topics. i don t want to single out r politics but it s the easiest sub that comes to mind. it d be nice if the material that is visible was ranked on how much discussion it creates rather than how much it pleases the crowd. this way a few downvotes early on cannot bury a post, the only thing that can do that is being so uninteresting that nobody bothers to comment on it."," 4chan’s algorithm for discussion threads is superior to Reddit’s. : the more people comment on a post, the longer it stays on the front page. i think this is preferable to the upvote downvote system because that means the most contentious and engaged topics are what is seen. too many interesting posts on reddit go unnoticed due to rigorous downvoting. sometimes a publication like national review can put out a very interesting article but it will never be seen on r politics due to the left slant of most of its user base and the barrage of downvotes such a post would receive. if such a post were instead ranked based on interaction rather than voting, i think you d see a more diverse range of topics. i don t want to single out r politics but it s the easiest sub that comes to mind. it d be nice if the material that is visible was ranked on how much discussion it creates rather than how much it pleases the crowd. this way a few downvotes early on cannot bury a post, the only thing that can do that is being so uninteresting that nobody bothers to comment on it.",i think the best way to rank posts on reddit is by comment.,"i contest that we have an algorithm on 4chan. there is no algorithm, just a mass of assholes. which include me.","i think you're missing the point. reddit is a place where people can have fun. it's a place for people to share their opinions and ideas. if you want to see the most interesting posts on the front page, you need to see what people think of them. that's why we have downvoting systems. it doesn't matter if the content is interesting or not, it's important to be able to see it. if people don't like the content, they're not going to be interested in it.","i don't think 4chan's algorithm is superior to reddit's algorithm, but i do think it is better than reddit's. i think the algorithm is better because it is easier to filter out content that is not relevant to the discussion rather than the content itself. for example, if i post something that is relevant to a discussion, i'm going to be able to filter it out from the top. if someone posts something that isn't relevant to that discussion, then i'm not going to filter the content out of the top of the page. if i posted something that wasn't relevant, i wouldn't filter out the content. i'd filter out things that aren't relevant because i don't want to get bogged down in the downvoting process.","i think the best way to rank posts on reddit is by comment. if you want to rank a post, you need to rank it by comment rate."

 Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords.,"by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name?

 I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue.,"i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you."," I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue. : i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you.",i don't think a woman should be able to have an abortion.,"if the girl lets the guy cum inside her or she wasn t too careful just like he probably wasn t, then surely if the guy wants to keep the child she should at least consider his thoughts and how he feels? girls have too much power and could possible crush a guys dreams because she has the right to do so","i'm not sure what your view is, but i think it's worth considering. the fetus is a human being. it's not a person. it is a person who has a right to life. it doesn't matter if the baby is conscious or not, it's a person that has the right to choose whether or not to have sex.","i'm going to try to change your view by saying that you think abortion is a women's rights issue. i don't think that it is, but i think it is a woman's right to determine for herself whether or not she wants to have sex.",i don't think a woman should be able to have an abortion. i think she should be allowed to do whatever she wants with her body. i don't believe she should have the right to decide whether or not she wants to have sex with another person. i do think the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible is their responsibility.

their race and sexuality are irrelevant. however, politically, all of these people range from center left to far left. i have never worked with a conservative professionally, because they either don't want to go into my field or don't make the cut. there is no ideological litmus test that stops conservatives from becoming scientists. they're not being persecuted. they just don't make it. part of the issue is that conservatism in the modern american form holds some very stupid ideas that repel intelligent people who have a wide range of life experiences. for example, anyone who goes to college for several years is likely to have at least a few gay friends and want them to be happily married if they so choose. it's hard for someone who knows several gays as normal people who want to live normal lives to be afraid of them getting married or see it as a threat; that view can come only from unfamiliarity and or fervent belief in a self contradictory book of ancient fables. conservatism is also closely associated with several anti science views and policy actions, including rejecting evolution and denying the existence of anthropogenic climate change. people intelligent enough to become scientists are very unlikely to hold those conservative views. likewise, scientists are likely to have traveled quite a bit for research and to conferences, and to have lived in several different places; all of these things provide some exposure to other cultures and reduce the fear of other cultures, or of mixing of cultures, that's implicit in mainstream conservative positions on issues like immigration. if you were to insist that teams of scientists must have political views proportional to those of the country at large basically affirmative action for political views you'd have to reach for completely unqualified people to fill the conservative spots, and they'd have nothing to do but sit around picking their noses. conservatism in general rarely imbues somebody with ideas that make them valuable for any task, and certainly not in the way a different measure of diversity of knowledge such as college major does. there is certainly a role for center right conservatives, or at least for centrists, in opposing the occasional excesses of the far left. i would like to see a reasonable, good faith opposition to the far left as a moderating force in our politics. but conservatives who fit that mould are pretty rare.","i think diversity is a good thing, but it's not the only thing that matters. diversity is one of the most important things in our society. it's important to have a diverse group of people who share the same values, values, beliefs, and opinions. diversity doesn't mean you have to be racist or sexist or whatever. diversity means you can have diverse groups of people, but you can't have diversity because you don't have to have the same beliefs.",diversity of beliefs and thoughts is way more important than diversity of identity,"i think diversity of thought is more important than diversity of opinion, but i don't think it's the same thing as 'diversity of thought.'diversity of opinions is the same as diversity of ideas. if you want to have a board of 10 straight white males with all differing political stances and opinions, you need to have the board of 5 straight white men with leftist opinions. that's not a diverse board, it's a diverse group of people with differing political views and opinions."
" University Affirmative Action in the United States should be based on economics, not race.","i ll preface this by saying that i am a white male and i am completely open to ideas against my viewpoint. while i do understand that this is likely true some of the time, i think there is a more influential limit to many students educational achievement in high school: their family s income. for instance, wealthier families can afford to move to higher income areas with better funded public schools, or send their children to high quality private schools. poorer families likely would neither be able to afford to live in an area with a top public school nor pay the tuition for a private school for their children. a wealthy black family would be able to afford this; a poor white family would not. while i do not deny that racism still exists in the us, i do not think that it has much of an effect on a student s educational achievement, while the wealth of the family has a profound effect for the reasons i stated before. cmv."," University Affirmative Action in the United States should be based on economics, not race. : i ll preface this by saying that i am a white male and i am completely open to ideas against my viewpoint. while i do understand that this is likely true some of the time, i think there is a more influential limit to many students educational achievement in high school: their family s income. for instance, wealthier families can afford to move to higher income areas with better funded public schools, or send their children to high quality private schools. poorer families likely would neither be able to afford to live in an area with a top public school nor pay the tuition for a private school for their children. a wealthy black family would be able to afford this; a poor white family would not. while i do not deny that racism still exists in the us, i do not think that it has much of an effect on a student s educational achievement, while the wealth of the family has a profound effect for the reasons i stated before. cmv.",I do not believe that race has a significant effect on a students educational achievement.,affirmative action is a government program that seeks to correct or make amends for government discrimination. the government discrimination was based on race therefore affirmative action is based on race. even if you disagree with the program the logic does follow. additionally a wealthy minority family can still be discriminated against. and the government already has numerous programs for economically disadvantaged.,"i'm not sure if this is a good or bad view, but i think it's important to look at the differences between rich and poor. for example, rich people are more likely to be poor than poor people, but poor people are less likely to have poor parents. also, poor people tend to have a higher chance of getting into college than rich people. i think this is due to the fact that a lot of the people who go to college are poor, which means that they have less money to spend on education. this is not to say that poor people can't afford college, but that they should be able to afford it.","i think it's important to understand that affirmative action is not based on race. it's based on the idea that a person's race is more important than their ability to achieve a certain level of academic achievement. for example, if you're poor, and you can't afford to live in an area with a top public school or pay the tuition for a private school, then you shouldn't be able to get into a public school. you should be allowed to attend private schools, but you should also be allowed not to go to public schools.","i think it's important to remember that race is not the only factor in a person's educational success. it's also important to note that if a person is poor, they are less likely to have the same opportunities as a person of the same race. for example, if a white person is rich, they will have more opportunities than a black person. however, if they are poor, it's not because of their race, but because of the fact that they are more likely to be poor."

personally i'm fine with killing things. i eat meat, i'm fine with kill shelters, with animal testing etc. however, i value human life. there is a religious reason i have for valuing human life. i believe that humans are made in god's image and that other animals are given to us, with our dominion over them. we shouldn't kill animals recklessly because we have dominion, but it is amoral whether or not an animal dies. however, i think it is moral whether or not a human is killed or not. if you are not religious, then according to the atheistic logic that makes sense to me, you get to define what is right and wrong. so you decide if human lives are moral or not, whether animal lives are moral or not, whether plant lives are moral or not. if you aren't deciding for yourself, then you are deciding from a relativist cultural standpoint i'm assuming you aren't, but i'll cover it just in case . if this is the case, then it is legally acceptable in america and it is something that is hidden. don't ask, don't tell. you only risk cultural shame by mentioning it which is why i'm assuming you aren't talking about relativism .","i'm going to try to change your view in a different way. first, i think it's important to recognize that the fetus is not a person. it is a part of your body, and therefore you have the right to choose whether or not you want to have it. if you want it to be a person, you need to be able to choose what to do with it. that means that you can't force someone else to do something that is harmful to your body. if a woman wants to have a baby, she has the right not to do that. if she doesn't want to do it, she can't do it. second, you say that you don't think abortion is child abuse, but that's not the case. it's not child abuse.","i'm pro choice because i don't think it's a slippery slope. i'm pro life because i believe that it's the right thing to do. i think it is the wrong thing to be pro choice, but i also believe that the right to bodily autonomy is the right of the mother to decide what she wants to do with her body. i also think that abortion should be a right to life. i do not believe that a woman should be forced to give up her right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. however, i do believe that women should be allowed to choose what they want with their bodies. if a woman wants an abortion, she should be able to do so. if she doesn't want to, she shouldn't have to.","i think it's important to note that abortion is a choice. it's not a choice, it's a choice made by the mother. if you're going to have a child, you should be able to do so."

 X-Men is a bad and potentially dangerous metaphor for the LGBT struggle,"see, anyone can have lgbt experiences, and what is doing the harm is the categorization of people into neat boxes that you can use to oppress them. boxes that, at the end of the day, don't reflect the reality and the diversity of people's experiences. i think it's better to focus on the fact that the lines people draw in order to be able to oppress marginalized people are inherently blurry, and that you can't effectively separate people into those who you want to oppress and those who are immune. in the case of lgbt people, how strong should your attraction to the same sex be or to what extent should your gender identity not align with the one you were assigned at birth, in order to be excluded from the lgbt community? it's better to be inclusive than to try and accept the boxes that society puts us in. but being a mutant is different. you either are or aren't a mutant. there are no half ass powers. mutants and non mutants are different enough for a legitimate case to be made for separatism. this idea of separatism, that we're so different from non queer people that they're not allowed in our spaces, is something that i see gaining popularity these days, and i honestly feel like it could be dangerous, and it could exclude people who need our help most, young and questioning people who don't immediately adopt a queer identity as a lot of us do."," X-Men is a bad and potentially dangerous metaphor for the LGBT struggle : see, anyone can have lgbt experiences, and what is doing the harm is the categorization of people into neat boxes that you can use to oppress them. boxes that, at the end of the day, don't reflect the reality and the diversity of people's experiences. i think it's better to focus on the fact that the lines people draw in order to be able to oppress marginalized people are inherently blurry, and that you can't effectively separate people into those who you want to oppress and those who are immune. in the case of lgbt people, how strong should your attraction to the same sex be or to what extent should your gender identity not align with the one you were assigned at birth, in order to be excluded from the lgbt community? it's better to be inclusive than to try and accept the boxes that society puts us in. but being a mutant is different. you either are or aren't a mutant. there are no half ass powers. mutants and non mutants are different enough for a legitimate case to be made for separatism. this idea of separatism, that we're so different from non queer people that they're not allowed in our spaces, is something that i see gaining popularity these days, and i honestly feel like it could be dangerous, and it could exclude people who need our help most, young and questioning people who don't immediately adopt a queer identity as a lot of us do.","people in the LGBT community need to accept that everyone is different, and stop trying to categorize people into neat boxes.","as a fan of x men i agree with you that it's a dangerous parallel to draw. i feel like the whole point of x men was to show that powers is not what defines us as people, and it's our actions that define us as individuals. as should real life, i don't care what your orientation is as long as you're a nice guy i'll treat you nicely. however the struggle between the x men and magnito as shown in the movies is how the lgbt community want to be seen so that's how they're going to see it. it's a good metaphor becuse in the movies it shows a group of people that are mistreated becuse they are different and becuse people don't understand them. although thats not how i see things it's how the community sees them. they see it as a 'they don't understand us because they aren't us' which is a dangerous idea to have becuse of how it turns out in the movies and the comics but it is a valid one for what they beleive in. so i'm not saying they're right, but it does seem like a perfect parallel to how they feel. and all we really want is to understand each other so we can figure out where to proceed, but if they don't draw that line like magneto then they're afraid the community will be destroyed.","i think you're misunderstanding the purpose of lgbt rights. it's not to be inclusive, it's to make people feel comfortable. it is to make them feel like they belong in the community. that's what it's like to be part of a community, and it's a part of being a member of that community.","i don't think it's a good metaphor for the lgbt struggle, but i do think it is a good one.",i think it depends on what you mean by 'tidy boxes'. i think it's better to focus on the fact that the lines people draw in order to be able to oppress marginalized people are inherently blurry and that you can't effectively separate people into those who you want to oppress and those who are immune.

lip service to social issues and being center to center right on foreign policy, wall street regulations, and especially on issues regarding all the money swirling around congress. the hot topic right now is how radical mainstream democrats are and how scary and new that is. mainstream democrats have been moving to the right for decades to appeal to moderates and to pad their pocketbooks, and only recently have started to shift back left when they finally started to realize the were losing more of their base than was being gained in new moderate voters. this isn't new, it's a return to a compromise second approach rather than compromise first, and is more aligned with the largest portions of their base. my point is, i'm still an independent progressive. i could have called myself a member of the democratic party the whole time and been more right than wrong on sheer percentage. hell, i'm probably 70 80 aligned at this point in the shift, at least with the rhetoric, and that's pretty damn high. but i'm not choosing a team, i'm not leaving myself open to be burned by another tactical shift, and most importantly i'm not raising money for the dnc to hoard it away or pay it out to candidates the people don't want. no, i will vote based on the policies that the men and women running align themselves with, and when that means i'm voting republican very rare, best example i have is the mayor of my town after years of a corrupt democrat or independent or third party unless it's the general election for president, i'm not interested in lighting that particular vote on fire so be it. you should figure out what's important to you and define yourself by that. your party isn't interested in you beyond your money and your vote. but you'll find individual candidates here and there who will be interested in your values and ideas, and they will fight for them. don't miss out on that because you're playing for the team. because i realize my comment can be seen as off topic. i disagree with you because you are the one who has labeled yourself, and the onus is on you to change that. people are justified in their assessment of you as a republican, because at minimum you are a benign accomplice to all the ideas republicans espouse. even if that isn't 100 accurate, nobody sees you fighting the monster from within, debating republicans on conservatism, fighting republicans when they are harmful to your sensibilities. they see you as accepting those things and they are justified in that because most of them have no way to see otherwise.","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i'm going to point out that you're not a republican. you're a democrat, and you don't believe in gay marriage. you believe that gay marriage should be legal, but you believe it should be illegal. you also believe that people should be able to marry whoever they want, regardless of their gender. you think that gay people should have the right to marry anyone they want regardless of who they want to marry, but that's not what you're trying to do.","i don't think it's fair to assume that everyone in a political party believes everything that the party stands for. if you want to believe that people in a party believe everything that they stand for, then you have to look at the difference between the two parties. for example, the democrats believe in gay marriage, while the republicans believe in traditional marriage, and voted against gay marriage in 2015. the republican party believes that gay marriage is illegal, but voted for it in 2015 because it was not legal in the first place. the democratic party voted for gay marriage because it wasn't legal in 2015, but they voted against it in 2016 because they thought it was illegal in 2015. i think that's a fair comparison.","i'm not sure what you mean by'republican'. i'm a republican, but i don't think you can be a republican."

 A flaw with Reddit is that those who post comments early get the most attention.,"obviously this is not a die hard rule. often times people come into posts several hours late, but have a great comment, and end up getting enough votes to be seen. this results in them being seen more and, therefore, getting more upvotes simply for being seen. sure, you can see the best comments if you really look hard. i love reddit and really appreciate the vote based system it uses, but the fact that you can have an extremely relevant view or extremely relevant information for a post but that almost no one will ever see makes it flawed. i'm not saying i have a better solution. i did award one delta. i tried to respond to most people and will continue to do so if i see some interesting new view. comment."," A flaw with Reddit is that those who post comments early get the most attention. : obviously this is not a die hard rule. often times people come into posts several hours late, but have a great comment, and end up getting enough votes to be seen. this results in them being seen more and, therefore, getting more upvotes simply for being seen. sure, you can see the best comments if you really look hard. i love reddit and really appreciate the vote based system it uses, but the fact that you can have an extremely relevant view or extremely relevant information for a post but that almost no one will ever see makes it flawed. i'm not saying i have a better solution. i did award one delta. i tried to respond to most people and will continue to do so if i see some interesting new view. comment.","i think the rule ""you have to post a comment before you can get an upvote"" is flawed.","what you're experiencing is partially a product of the individual subreddit rules. for an alternative, look no further than r askhistorians. i don't feel anyone would disagree with the statement that the rules there are strict and enforced heavily and efficiently. the top comment is always the most useful in part because anything which falls short of their impeccable standards is promptly removed. this sometimes means questions can take all day to come in, in some cases as much as a week, but when they do arrive you can be almost certain that the post is accurate and well cited. however, it does come at some cost, they don't tolerate posts which aren't directly related to the question at hand such as jokes and often when a question hits the front page the comment section will have a vast graveyard of removed comments which were deemed irrelevant or unable to satisfy the depth required for answering the question.",i agree with you. but i don't think it's the best solution. it's a terrible system.,"it seems to me that a flaw in this system is that the only way to see the best comments is to see them first. it's not easy to do this, but i think it's a good thing to have a system where you can see the comments first. if you don't see the comment first, you can't see it in the first place. you can only see the first comment if you look hard enough, but if you do, you'll see the second comment first.","i agree with you in principle, but i don't think it's the best idea. i think it would be better to have a system where you can post a comment before it gets an upvote, rather than a system that requires you to post it in the first place."

 Illegal immigrants should be deported from the United States,"i want to start this by saying this has nothing to do with race, religion, ethnicity, or nationality. this source attempts to argue that they do in fact pay taxes, and i will admit that yes, some do. this works out to be a little over 100 per person in income tax. that is not enough money to justify the claim that they pay their fair share of taxes. additionally, we have laws in place to legally immigrate into the us. if we are going to ignore these laws and just allow anyone to enter the country and stay here, then we have lost the sovereignty of the nation. one of my parents is a legal immigrant, and went through the process in the right way. i understand our current process of legally coming here is very messed up. i am a big proponent of simplifying the application process, reducing the wait time, and making legal immigration more accessible. this is not an argument about immigration in general."," Illegal immigrants should be deported from the United States : i want to start this by saying this has nothing to do with race, religion, ethnicity, or nationality. this source attempts to argue that they do in fact pay taxes, and i will admit that yes, some do. this works out to be a little over 100 per person in income tax. that is not enough money to justify the claim that they pay their fair share of taxes. additionally, we have laws in place to legally immigrate into the us. if we are going to ignore these laws and just allow anyone to enter the country and stay here, then we have lost the sovereignty of the nation. one of my parents is a legal immigrant, and went through the process in the right way. i understand our current process of legally coming here is very messed up. i am a big proponent of simplifying the application process, reducing the wait time, and making legal immigration more accessible. this is not an argument about immigration in general.","i believe illegal immigrants do not pay their fair share of taxes, and should be deported immediately.","based on what you outline, it seems that you believe someone who was brought here as a child, speaks only english, and has no memory of ever living or being in their country of birth should be deported?","the problem with this is that it's not a question of income tax. it's a question about how much of a burden it is on the taxpayer to pay for it. for example, if you don't pay taxes, you're not paying taxes. if you pay taxes on your income, then you're paying taxes on the amount of money you owe to the government. the problem is that the government doesn't have the money to pay the taxes of the people who come to the country. it has the right to do so, but it's also the right of the government to decide who gets to live in the country, and who doesn't. the government can't force people to pay taxes if they don't want to.","i think you're misinterpreting the reality of illegal immigration. there are millions of people in the united states that are not citizens of the us, and they don't pay taxes. the us is not the only country in the world with illegal immigrants, and it is the most important country to live in. in fact, the us has the highest rate of immigration in the developed world.","the problem with your argument is that it ignores the fact that illegal immigrants are not the only ones who pay taxes. if you look at the numbers of illegal immigrants, you'll see that the vast majority of them don't pay their fair share of taxes. it's not that they aren't paying taxes, it's that they don't have to pay any taxes at all."

 I don't see how morality can be objective,"it's abstract. unless you believe rational thoughts can appear without any humans present, it's subjective. the reason things like trees are objective is because if you were to kill every human, the tree would still be there. but you can't say the same for something that exists in head. so yeah, that's my argument. i'd prefer no theological attempts at changing my view god exists and his morals are objective because that'd completely shift the focus of the discussion, and i'm an apatheist."," I don't see how morality can be objective : it's abstract. unless you believe rational thoughts can appear without any humans present, it's subjective. the reason things like trees are objective is because if you were to kill every human, the tree would still be there. but you can't say the same for something that exists in head. so yeah, that's my argument. i'd prefer no theological attempts at changing my view god exists and his morals are objective because that'd completely shift the focus of the discussion, and i'm an apatheist.",I don't believe in an all-knowing and all-seeing.,"i generally believe that morality is subjective for the most part, but i think it is possible to construct a non theological framework for objective morality. tell me if you disagree with my definition of morality, but i'm going to use one of the first ones i found with a quick search: a system of ideas of right and wrong conductthe first step is to decide on some goals, some purpose for having morality. this step is a bit subjective, but i think theoretically you could come up with a few baseline points that a large amount of people could agree with for example, we want a system of morality that minimizes suffering, while maximizing enjoyment and quality of life. all of those terms might have to be defined a bit better, but lets imagine we sit down with a bunch of people and decide on some metrics that we can agree on to determine quality of life, suffering, etc. at this point, i think i can believe that there is some objectively optimal morality that we could choose to adopt, which if we all followed would fit the criteria layed out in the previous step. without a god to deliver that morality to us, we might not ever discover it, and even less likely that everyone would choose to follow it, but it probably exists, independent of whether we know about it or not.","i'm going to focus on the first part of your argument. i'm not sure what you mean by 'objective.'i don't think that's what you're talking about. i think you're arguing against the idea that god exists, and that he doesn't exist. i would argue that he does exist, but that doesn't mean that he can't exist in the first place.","i think you're missing the point of morality. it's a thought, it's an ideal, and it's subjective. it can be objective, but it doesn't have to be objective. for example, if you kill every human in the world, you can't say that it's objective. you can say that the tree would still be there if you were to kill all humans, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be there. it just means that you could say that if you killed every human, the tree wouldn't still exist.","i don't believe in an all knowing and allseeing god, but i do believe in a god who exists in a way that is consistent with our understanding of reality. i don't know if i can convince you that god exists or not, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't exist. you can't say the same for something that exists in your head, but you can say that it exists in other parts of your brain."

 Contemporary Feminism is sexist,ok so first of i think of everyone as equal and i don't think any race or gender is better then the rest. it's sexist for both men and woman actually. so they get stuff handed to them. a small example of this is a female adaptation for every movie. if hollywood was truely feminist they would make their own movie with a female lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie. now on the male end of this. so a man can't make a valid point without being called priveleged white scum or what have you. yes i know all men aren't white but you see my point. i truely think it's coming from a good place. however they need to become more self aware and realize they are who they hate. so yeah that's it. change my view, Contemporary Feminism is sexist : ok so first of i think of everyone as equal and i don't think any race or gender is better then the rest. it's sexist for both men and woman actually. so they get stuff handed to them. a small example of this is a female adaptation for every movie. if hollywood was truely feminist they would make their own movie with a female lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie. now on the male end of this. so a man can't make a valid point without being called priveleged white scum or what have you. yes i know all men aren't white but you see my point. i truely think it's coming from a good place. however they need to become more self aware and realize they are who they hate. so yeah that's it. change my view,"i think men are always the ""bad guys"" in society.","the best way that i ve been able to describe modern feminism is with the analogy of a race. normally, everyone begins at the same starting block, and when the gun goes off, everyone goes on a runnin. however, due to inequality, there are very few races in the world that have everyone on equal footing, if they could even be let in to start the race in the first place. in short, some racers don t even get to start at the start. in this specific case, we ll focus on women. the first wave of feminism brought western women up toward the starting line a whole bunch! the right to vote, divorce, etc, moved women s rights forward and gave them more of a fighting chance at equity. however, they still were not starting as far forward as men. next game advancements in attitudes toward female sexuality and reproductive freedom, equality in the workplace, each step bringing women a bit closer to the starting line. however, we are still not there. now, let s tackle modern examples that you ve given, like female representation in the media. this is, to some including me , a comparatively small step forward when it comes to getting to the starting line. however, it is still a step forward. think about it from the prospective of women in this race we see ourselves pushing closer and closer to the starting line, more and more toward equity. some people may see this, however, as their chance at the proverbial first place being threatened. technically, yeah. the more people there are in the game, the more likely someone else will win out. however, this is where i like to make things a bit bigger picture. yes, human nature is self preservation. we want the best for ourselves, and this is not always a bad instinct. however, it s entirely possible to want the best for yourself and want the best for others as well. that is why feminism has also fought to ensure that male rape victims are treated fairly in society and in law, that fathers have an equal chance in custody cases if they choose to pursue it, that men do not suffer from the same generalisations and stereotypes that harm women. i will not deny that every movement has its fringes that must be challenged when they make harmful statements, generalisations, and accusations. feminism is no different. however, it still holds the equity of sexes at its heart, and that means getting everyone to the same starting line. cassini.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i'll try to change your view in a few ways. firstly, you're conflating 'feminism' with 'racism' and 'white privilege.'i'm not really sure what your view is, but you seem to think that there's some sort of distinction between 'feminist' and the 'white' side of things, and i don't think there's one. if a white person is white and a black person is black, it's not as if the white person isn't white. it's like saying, 'i don't like black people, so i can't make a movie about black people.'or 'i hate white people because i'm white.'but that's not the case. i'm sure there are plenty of people who are white and black, but that doesn't mean that they're 'white.'you're saying that white people shouldn't be","feminism isn't about equality, it's about equality of opportunity. it's not about equality for women, it is about equality between men and women. you can't make a movie with a female lead, but you can make a film with a male lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie.","i don't think it's a bad thing that men are the 'bad guys' in society, it's just that it's not a good thing for society."
" I don't believe that 'non-binary' or 'genderfluid' people is a real thing, and that the people who claim these things are mostly doing so because it's trendy.","i want to preface this by saying that i'm not anti gay, or anti trans, or anything like that so that's not what i mean when i say this."," I don't believe that 'non-binary' or 'genderfluid' people is a real thing, and that the people who claim these things are mostly doing so because it's trendy. : i want to preface this by saying that i'm not anti gay, or anti trans, or anything like that so that's not what i mean when i say this.",I'm starting to think I'm anti-gay.,"i'm bisexual, fully down the middle. there are different 'roles' that women are expected to play in relation to their sexuality. straight women are expected to be coy and reject male advances to prove their 'worth', which is trash, and leaves me feeling ashamed about my body, sexual desire, and sense of self. gay women are expected me to resent all things straight, which leaves me feeling ashamed about my body, sexuality, and sense of self. obviously these are generalizations, but they run deep and have had real effects on my life. the reasons that i'm mentioning this is because people always make assumptions based on gender, and being bisexual made me hyperaware of this. i tried to kill myself at 14 because the thought of becoming a woman not physically but socially was unthinkable. so, yea for me there's something deeper than 'i can use this to look cool'. side note: people are surprised i choose to be nongender because i'm i've got a 'classic' female body ie 5'8'', white, big tits, small waist, blond hair, blue eyes. i think the reason me as nongender confuses folk is because they, like you, connect nongender to 'desperate' gay lesbians who are confused about their identity, or people wanting to be 'trendy'. just because can easily and perfectly fit into the idea of what 'femininity' should be doesn't make it any less toxic.","i think you're confusing the word 'anti' with 'anti'. if you mean 'anti gay', then i don't see how that is any different than 'anti trans' at all. i mean, i'm pro gay, but i'm not anti trans. i'm anti gay because i think that's what it means to be anti gay. it's like saying 'i don't care about gay people, i just care about straight people.'it's not about being anti gay, it's about being pro trans.","i don't think it's a real thing, but i think it is trendy. it's not trendy because it's trendy.",i don't think you should be anti gay. i think you need to define what you mean when you say 'anti gay.

 I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue.,"i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you."," I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue. : i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you.",i don't think a woman should be able to have an abortion.,"not at all going into the talking points of abortion, in the most basic of senses, it's a woman's rights issue in the sense that it involves a woman, and whether or not they have the right to get an abortion. so whatever side you're on, it's a woman's rights issue. you're debating whether women have this right or not.","i think you're missing the point of the argument. the baby is a human being, not a fetus.","i think it's important to distinguish between the right to bodily autonomy and the right of bodily autonomy. the bodily autonomy argument is a valid one, but it's not about whether or not a fetus is a human or not. it's about whether a fetus has a right to life or not, and whether that right is valid.","i don't think a woman should be able to have an abortion, but i do think a man should have the right to choose whether or not he wants to have sex with a woman."

 It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa,"high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives."," It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa : high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives.",I believe that iq is a stupid measure of intelligence.,"i think that if you join any kind of society for the express purpose of being able to brag about your eligibility, you probably have some insecurity to work through but this is hardly unique to members of mensa. another example that comes to mind is paying to be listed in who's who directories and the like. on the other hand, there are people who join societies like this because they enjoy the activities and social programs therein. many older people in particular, who may be lonely, might look for any kind of group or society they are eligible to join. i've never heard a bragging word leave my elderly neighbor's mouth, but she goes to mensa meetings every week because she likes to simultaneously have human interaction and keep her mind sharp by doing brain games with other people who enjoy them. anytime she mentions mensa, it's usually because she want to share a cool puzzle she got there. in brief: if your motive for joining mensa is to brag, then you have issues with insecurity. but that is not the only reason people join mensa. so i think that to say the organization itself is stupid because a certain subset of its members join only for status is not a tenable argument. societal attitudes toward praising intelligence or other heritable traits is a separate issue entirely, of which certain individuals' mensa membership is at most a byproduct.","if iq is a measure of intelligence, then iq should be judged by the iq of the members. if it isn't, then it shouldn't be judged at all.",i don't think it's stupid to join a high iq society like Mensa. i think it is stupid to be a member of a club that only allows members with a certain iq percentile.,i don't think it's a stupid measure of intelligence. i think it is a useful measure of a person's intelligence.

 (Theoretical) physics is no longer beneficial and should be defunded,"in past eras, advanced physics helped humanity develop by explaining the world around us. it helped us understand orbits, advance our knowledge of how atoms function, leading to developments in many fields, and enable our technology to take advantage of more mechanics of the universe than before. however, recently the amount of useful results to come out of the physics field seems to have dwindled. now, most of what is produced seems to deal with highly conceptual research, such as string theory and quantum gravity. other avenues of research, such as particle physics research, produce information with little to no practical uses for humanity. the large hadron collider alone cost 4. 75 billion, and annually requiring approximately 1 billion to continue operation. although the collider was instrumental in proving the existence of the higgs boson, the particle has no uses. other experiments involve not investigating anything new at all, merely proving and re proving what we already know about relativity and its related research. instead of continuing to pour money into a field which has extremely limited benefits, i believe funding should be taken out of the physics field and used to solve real problems in the world. the money used to build the lhc could have been used for things like feeding the poor, fixing the education system, or advancing medicine. if the lhc's annual budget was taken away, there would be an extra 1 billion dollars every year dedicated to solving tangible real world problems."," (Theoretical) physics is no longer beneficial and should be defunded : in past eras, advanced physics helped humanity develop by explaining the world around us. it helped us understand

something that happens naturally because it's impossible to keep up with everything that goes on in the world. work on new subatomic models could all potentially be applied directly to things like the quantum computer, which would drastically reduce latency between computer connections. physicists are working on breakthroughs in the field of solid state matter, which in the future will be applied to more efficient energy storage. others are working on breakthroughs in nuclear fusion. which will be applied to greener safer energy. the thing with physics is that the benefits aren't felt immediately. that's why people aren't as aware of the practical applications. physicists lay out the roadmap for engineers to develop a practical product. this has been true throughout all of history.

we can't understand the laws of physics because we have no idea what the laws are, and so we have to figure out how to solve those laws. we also have the opportunity to learn about the universe, and how it works. the only way to do that is to understand what it's like to live in a universe that is so vast that it's impossible for us to know anything about it, and we need to know how to figure

 The left is more fascist than the right in America.,"contrary to what reddit would have you believe fascism doesn't 'racist' or 'far right'. fascism just means gt; a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power,forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc so there's three main components of fascism. 1. government has complete power 2. they forcibly suppress opposition 3. they regiment industry and commerce so let's start with 1. trump's administration is deregulating at an incredible rate and deregulation is one of the core republican policies. positions of the republican party deregulation significantly decreases both the size and power of a government. now number 2. forcibly suppressing opposition doesn't necessarily have to be done through murder. censorship is also extremely effective at this. this is made evident from the widespread censorship of conservative view points from all major social networks. you could make the argument that the left only calls for censorship of speech that incites violence. the right has fewer circumstances in which they believe their opposition must be censored. you could also argue that these are private companies completely within their rights to not give a platform to anybody for whatever reason. but that situation is very comparable to when street owners tried to censor demonstrations from people they didn't agree with politically. this was dangerous because the street owners had an oligarchy on the means of free speech. they could censor any idea they disagreed with. this is a perfect comparison for social networks today, with one judge going as far as to say gt;

' 3. i'm not really sure what work 'regiment' is doing in your definition, but this is the part that seems to least relevant to fascism. economic interventionism, the left most certainly is. but that does not make them any more or any less fascist than the right. amp; x200b;",i don't think it's fair to say that the democrats are worse than the republicans.,"the problem with your argument is that it assumes that the left and right are in favor of a government with complete power. i don't think this is the case. i think the problem is that you assume that the right and the left are in favour of the government having complete power, while the left is not.",i don't think it's pointless to call the current state of america 'fascism'. it's just a word used to describe a group of people.

 Infinity War was not that good.,"spoilers, obviously. also standard first time posting and on mobile disclaimers. at the time of writing, the movie has an 84 certified fresh rating on rotten tomatoes and the poll on r movies has a mean rating of 8. 81 i'd link it, but again, mobile . and despite wanting to love it, i came out of the movie largely disappointed. here are my complaints. 1. thanos is not a great villain. his rhetoric rings empty: the whole 'ultimate solution' schtick is never once challenged directly and never has an alternative solution proposed. sure he 'loves' his 'family,' but that's told to us, not shown, really. 2. the fights look good, but were ultimately nonsensical. strange's only use of the time stone ends up being pointless as he doesn't follow through unless that's part of the setup for how the avengers 'win' later in the follow up, which still rubs me the wrong way 3. in a 2 1 2 hour movie no one, with the very minor exception of vision, got any character development. i understand this is a consequence of the ambition of the project, but that's no excuse. and here's where i'm going to put a secondary super spoiler warning 4. literally erasing 50 of the cast was incredibly lazy. i understand this was an attempt to pare back the frankly unmanageable number of characters but it came off as an obvious plot device. having no rhyme or reason to who got dusted may have made plot sense but it's no coincidence that the characters lost were a. not the super main main characters ie tony and steve or anyone with whom they have unresolved plots ie black widow and b. were actors who likely had to be paid disproportionately to their screen time ie sam jackson, idris elba . the only outliers here to me seem to be starlord and strange. i have more minor complaints but this post is long and pretentious enough. cmv! i am admittedly a movie only person. that being said, i prefer to evaluate the experience in only that context."," Infinity War was not that good. : spoilers, obviously. also standard first time posting and on mobile disclaimers. at the time of writing, the movie has an 84 certified fresh rating on rotten tomatoes and the poll on r movies has a mean rating of 8. 81 i'd link it, but again, mobile . and despite wanting to love it, i came out of the movie largely disappointed. here are my complaints. 1. thanos is not a great villain. his rhetoric rings empty: the whole 'ultimate solution' schtick is never once challenged directly and never has an alternative solution proposed. sure he 'loves' his 'family,' but that's told to us, not shown, really. 2. the fights look good, but were ultimately nonsensical. strange's only use of the time stone ends up being pointless as he doesn't follow through unless that's part of the setup for how the avengers 'win' later in the follow up, which still rubs me the wrong way 3. in a 2 1 2 hour movie no one, with the very minor exception of vision, got any character development. i understand this is a consequence of the ambition of the project, but that's no excuse. and here's where i'm going to put a secondary super spoiler warning 4. literally erasing 50 of the cast was incredibly lazy. i understand this was an attempt to pare back the frankly unmanageable number of characters but it came off as an obvious plot device. having no rhyme or reason to who got dusted may have made plot sense but it's no coincidence that the characters lost were a. not the super main main characters ie tony and steve or anyone with whom they have unresolved plots ie black widow and b. were actors who likely had to be paid disproportionately to their screen time ie sam jackson, idris elba . the only outliers here to me seem to be starlord and strange. i have more minor complaints but this post is long and pretentious enough. cmv! i am admittedly a movie only person. that being said, i prefer to evaluate the experience in only that context.",i did not enjoy the movie avengers,"i think this post is over analzying what this situation was about. the movie also left out a very big part of thanos's character, which would be his obsession with the personification of death. wiping out 50 amp; 37; of the cast raised the stakes for the entire mcu. this pay off was awesome. and i don't think every character needs to be explained explored or driven by character development. the focus was on the problem at hand and finding a solution. the use of the infinity stones were quite awesome imo. i think that the russo brothers wanted to give a balanced fight to the audience. the avengers were not outmatched. they had their chances to win an ultimately fell short. how many super hero movies force to hero to confront his own shortcomings? only the best ones.","i don't think you can argue that starlord is a great villain, but that doesn't make him a bad villain. the only thing that makes him a good villain is the fact that he's a villain. he's the only one who doesn't have to be a villain, and that's all he has to do.","i'm not sure i can change your view, but i think you're misunderstanding what a movie is about. it's a movie about the avengers, and they're fighting against a very real threat. they're not going to win, they're going to have to deal with it for a long time, and that's a huge part of the reason why they're winning. they have to fight against a real threat, not a threat. but they're still going to fight, and it's not like they're just going to give up on the threat. there's also the fact that they aren't going to be able to stop the threat, which is a huge problem for them. if they were able to do that, they would have been able to win. but that's not the point of the movie. the point is that they're trying to do something, and if they can't do it, then they're probably going to end up losing. that's why","i don't think anyone is going to change your view that the avengers is a bad movie. i think you're missing the point of the movie, which is that the movie is supposed to be a good movie. it's not. the movie isn't meant to be an action movie. the plot is meant to make you want to see the movie. but that's not the point. the point is to make people want to watch the movie because it's a movie. that's what makes it good. if you don't like it, don't watch it."
 Sex before marriage is wrong,"i get that i am playing with fire with this question in the reddit community, and by all means i am not saying that it should be banned or along those lines. i'm hoping you can elaborate on why you believe its 'morally' correct and why you would allow your future children to do it themselves. cmv those who generally start getting involved in sexual intercourse happens at a young age anywhere from 12 18, at this time they are more prone to sexual diseases, teen pregnancy, and emotional anxiety due to lack of maturation and responsiblity. while this can occur at any age or time, this is the time where it all starts and leaves the most emotional damage. if any of you have seen the show '13 reasons why', try to imagine the scene were the girl tries to share a special momment with her 'first kiss' but then gets sexually assulted by the dude which was a part of her suicide. those that want to wait to experience those moments in life generally are happier people that have thriving marriages. they raise their kids well and children almost always follow their parents footsteps. think of the negative aspect of this domino effect. many girls that get pregnant at teenage years have a ripple effect on the child and the same thing happens to that kid. kids obviously will disobey their parents but the numbers prove that if their parents make certain choices their kids will follow i learned this in a college psychology class and im sure that you have known someone where this has happened. this is my personal belief now. these are not facts. i think sex is the ultimate and sacred symbol of unity. procreating or f cking whatever you want to call it is something you'd want to do with the person who'd never betray you or just ignore you after a one night stand. wheres the love?

" I would vote for a Democrat if they changed their position on guns, or at least educated themselves on the topic.","i want to start out by saying i'm not opposed to voting for a democrat. i wrote in bernie sanders name in 2016 because he aligned with a lot of my views, however, one thing especially at a national level i cannot stand is democrats views and general ignorance on guns. part of my issue stands in the fact that i really appreciate the constitution, i especially appreciate the second amendment. i believe that of all the rights we have as human beings the pre eminent one is the right to self defense. a bunch of colonists taking on the greatest military superpower of the time, it's a miracle america won. i also am a gun owner myself as well as my family. i live in a rural area where police presence is limited and when i'm sitting outside my rural house it scares me that help could be so far away. moreover, my father taught me to respect firearms to treat them as they were always loaded, to know my target and what's beyond, to never point a firearm at anything i'm not willing to shoot, to lock up my guns, and to keep my finger off the trigger and the trigger guard. i grew up in a not so gun centric house but i learned about them. as an adult, in modern politics, i see politicians mainly democrats trying to restrict the second amendment. which is all well and good except when i hear gun control advocates say 'bullet' rather than 'cartridge' or 'clip rather than 'magazine' so much of the gun control debate and policy is measured on the mechanics of firearms. i don't believe that democrats need to be an expert in firearms in order to have a say in the gun control debate, but i want my politicians who want to regulate my second amendment rights to understand the distinction between a semi automatic and an automatic weapon. i want them to understand that an automatic weapon fires as long as you hold the trigger down or until you run out of ammunition and a semi automatic weapons fire one round per trigger pull. i want them to understand that automatic weapons are extremely regulated and require a special federal license to acquire. i want them to understand that the ar in ar 15 doesn't stand for assault rifle and referring to it as that is disingenuous and appeal to emotional appeal. i want them to understand that 'silencers' suppressors don't make guns super quiet like in the movies. gunfire is very audible with a suppressor and saying otherwise is again disingenuous. the gun show loophole is another thing that bothers me, mostly because if you purchase a firearm from someone with a ffl regardless of location you must have a background check. now that we ve come to the midterm elections i ve been listening to the democratic candidates talk about gun control in the wake of parkland and las vegas."," I would vote for a Democrat if they changed their position on guns, or at least educated themselves on the topic. : i want to start out by saying i'm not opposed to voting for a democrat. i wrote in bernie sanders name in 2016 because he aligned with a lot of my views, however, one thing especially at a national level i cannot stand is democrats views and general ignorance on guns. part of my issue stands in the fact that i really appreciate the constitution, i especially appreciate the second amendment. i believe that of all the rights we have as human beings the pre eminent one is the right to self defense. a bunch of colonists taking on the greatest military superpower of the time, it's a miracle america won. i also am a gun owner myself as well as my family. i live in a rural area where police presence is limited and when i'm sitting outside my rural house it scares me that help could be so far away. moreover, my father taught me to respect firearms to treat them as they were always loaded, to know my target and what's beyond, to never point a firearm at anything i'm not willing to shoot, to lock up my guns, and to keep my finger off the trigger and the trigger guard. i grew up in a not so gun centric house but i learned about them. as an adult, in modern politics, i see politicians mainly democrats trying to restrict the second amendment. which is all well and good except when i hear gun control advocates say 'bullet' rather than 'cartridge' or 'clip rather than 'magazine' so much of the gun control debate and policy is measured on the mechanics of firearms. i don't believe that democrats need to be an expert in firearms in order to have a say in the gun

refuses to vote for a democrat that's pro gun control,"here's the official position of the dnc, as stated in the 2016 democratic platform preventing gun violence with 33,000 americans dying every year, democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence. while responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in america have suffered from gun violence. we can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. to build on the success of the lifesaving brady handgun violence prevention act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy; and keep weapons of war such as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines lcam's off our streets. we will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. there is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue. what part of this troubles you enough to vote for someone from a different party? note that in these modern times, the 4th amendment is much more important than the 2nd amendment in securing our freedom from tyranny. however, i appreciate that some people are in situations where they need guns to ensure their personal security.","i think it's important to understand that the second amendment is meant to protect citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. the government has a duty to protect the people from unreasonable search and seizure, and to make sure that no one is killed by unreasonable searches or seizures. however, the government does not have the duty to take away the citizens' right to own a firearm. it's the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens, not the government itself. it is the government's responsibility to protect their citizens, and it is their duty to ensure that the citizens of the united states have the means to defend themselves.","i don't think you're going to be able to change your view if you don't want to be an expert in guns. i'm not going to try to convince you that you shouldn't have a say in the gun control debate, but i'm going to tell you that i think you have a pretty good idea of what you're talking about, and i think it's important to understand that you're not just talking about the issue of gun control, but the issues of gun ownership. for example, i'm a gun owner myself. i live in a rural area where police presence is limited. when i'm sitting outside my rural house it scares me that help could be so far away. i don't know if i've ever been in a situation where the police presence was limited, but when i was in an area where there were no police presence, i knew that i'd never have to deal with the police. i know that i've never been in an instance where","i think you're missing a lot of the problems with the second amendment. first, it's not about whether or not a person has a right to self defense. it's about whether they have the right to own a gun. second, the 2nd amendment is meant to protect people from criminals and criminals. this is a very important part of the first amendment. if you believe that the government should be able to protect the rights of people, then you should believe that it should be allowed to do so."

Most recreational drugs should be legalised.,"the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why? well when any society attempts to control the consumption of any substance by banning it, we get black markets. that is essentially all strict drug laws do, they create a black market. that black market fuels organised crime and demonises certain persons from society. my second reason, is that if you legalise certain drugs people are consuming anyway you remove the taboo of them seeking help if they become addicted. as it currently stands there is help for those who want to quit smoking tobacco or quit consuming alcohol. these drugs are arguably far worse than most other substances available on the black market. my last reason is i fully believe that a lot of people can take other substances responsibly, in the same way one consumes alcohol. not every user is an addict. i think we need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable. i welcome any counter arguments here, in which may change my view.","Most recreational drugs should be legalised. : the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why?

" Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance.","let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k. 's claims that he did not fully understand how much power he wielded over these individuals because of his celebrity. to his cr, in every one of these instances, c. k. did ask before committing these acts. these instances seemed to happen at the time when his career was first starting to really flourish. i take him for his word when he said he didn t understand how, in his newly found celebrity, asking wasn t really asking. that is in no way an excuse for what c. k. did because his behavior was still wildly inappropriate, but i am still somewhat sympathetic to his explanation, which leads into my third point 3 lack of predatory nature: louis c. k. made bad judgments, but his behavior does not seem predatory to me the same way cosby's, spacey's, and weinstein s were. he never threatened to ruin a woman's career for not allowing him to expose himself in front of them, and based on the information we currently have, it seems as if this behavior stopped at some point. now, it is alleged that c. k. s agent david becky may have made vague threats on louis' behalf to the women who accused him, but i don't think that is enough to put that blame on louis. it is possible becky was acting without c. k. s knowledge. furthermore, when the ny times article was published, i found louis c. k. 's response to be a no bs acknowledgement of both the accusations and the hurt he caused. i think we have to give c. k. crfor that. 5 a learning moment: undoubtedly, the importance of metoo is that it finally gives victims of sexual assault a voice. but perhaps also we should hear from truly contrite men who have behaved inappropriately in the past to understand their reasoning and learn from their thoughts and regrets. i don t believe we should give predatory monsters like cosby, spacey, and weinstein a voice to explain their actions. it may be too soon for c. k. to make a comeback , but i think some day he should be allowed to."," Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance. : let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k.

"If I am an oppressor, it is in my interest to remain one.","i am a straight white male. for many, this means that i am not only in a position of privilege in relation to several other groups, but also that i hurt the interests of those groups by unconsciously exhibiting certain views and behaviors. for the sake of the argument, lets grant all of that. let's also assume that everyone is equal, regardless of sex, genetic background etc. and the only source of outcome variation is historical injustice and various structures and ideologies that support oppression. even if all of the above is true, there is no reason for me to actively seek to empower groups that i don't belong to. power is relative, so every bit of power that women, immigrants, minorities etc. gain, i lose. in fact, all of these groups have a proven record of actively trying to take my power away. not only that, but some of them openly declare so just enter the term 'white men' into google news. women's rights are a good example of this. 99. 93 of humans are born biologically male or female. that makes me concerned, because again, i want to be in a position of power, no matter what. perhaps men have oppressed women, that doesn't concern me. what concerns me is that we're not oppressing them now. even if we, just for the sake of the argument, assume that women are superior to men in some significant way, it would only make oppressing them all the more necessary. based on this reasoning, i support all political action that hurts the groups that i don't belong to. this has led me to having political positions that would be seen as extremely disagreeable by the absolute majority of westerners at least that's what i'm assuming . and i should probably emphasize here that this is not an ideological choice. more power is better than less no matter what. even if i was benevolent, i would still rather be benevolent from a position of power. now here you might say 'hey, this power stuff is weird, who thinks like that? ' and perhaps you're right. however, i have only about 80 years to live and i intend to extract maximum utility out of those 80 years. every millimeter matters. that's not to say that i go out there and engage in some kind of violent activism i still gain much more by just working towards my goals on my own. still, that doesn't stop me from feeling a little bit of joy every time i hear a complaint about women's reproductive rights or how the police in the us apparently hate black people.","If I am an oppressor, it is in my interest to remain one. : i am a straight white male. for many, this means that i am not only in a position of privilege in relation to several other groups, but also that i hurt the interests of those groups by unconsciously exhibiting certain views and behaviors. for the sake of the argument, lets grant all of that. let's also assume that everyone is equal, regardless of sex, genetic background etc. and the only source of outcome variation is historical injustice and various structures and ideologies that support oppression. even if all of the above is true, there is no reason for me to actively seek to empower groups that i don't belong to. power is relative, so every bit of power that women, immigrants, minorities etc. gain, i lose. in fact, all of these groups have a proven record of actively trying to take my power away. not only that, but some of them openly declare so just enter the term 'white men' into google news. women's rights are a good example of this. 99. 93 of humans are born biologically male or female. that makes me concerned, because again, i want to be in a position of power, no matter what. perhaps men have oppressed women, that doesn't concern me. what concerns me is that we're not oppressing them now. even if we, just for the sake of the argument, assume that women are superior to men in some significant way, it would only make oppressing them all the more necessary. based on this reasoning, i support all political action that hurts the groups that i don't belong to. this has led me to having political positions that would be seen as extremely disagreeable by the absolute majority of westerners at least that's what i'm assuming . and i should probably emphasize here that this is not an ideological choice. more power is better than less no matter what. even if i was benevolent, i would still rather be benevolent from a position of power. now here you might say 'hey, this power stuff is weird, who thinks like that?

 The rich should pay more for a traffic infraction than the poor,"i recently stumbled across the idea of progressive traffic fines, which work in a way similar to progressive taxes. i came to agree with the notion, though i've found few arguments to the contrary. c a progressive traffic fine based on the income of the violator would punish violators more equally, and thus be more just. i am willing to entertain other ideas about this, and change my view where merited!"," The rich should pay more for a traffic infraction than the poor : i recently stumbled across the idea of progressive traffic fines, which work in a way similar to progressive taxes. i came to agree with the notion, though i've found few arguments to the contrary. c a progressive traffic fine based on the income of the violator would punish violators more equally, and thus be more just. i am willing to entertain other ideas about this, and change my view where merited!",I believe that fines for speeding should be based on the income of the driver.,"right, what makes them think they're entitled to their own money? they should give it to me! because reasons","if you're going to pay someone for something they didn't do, you have to pay them for it. if you're not paying for it, you're paying them for something that they did not do.","i agree with you, but i disagree with the idea that the rich should pay more for a traffic infraction than the poor. i don't think it's fair to say that the poor should be punished more harshly than the rich. i think the problem is that it's unfair to punish the rich based on their income. if the rich can't afford to pay more, then they shouldn't be punished at all.","the income of the person who is driving is not the same as the income of those who are driving. if you are speeding, you are paying more in taxes than the person driving you."
 Addiction is a choice not a disease,"at least initially. there is a time in everyone s life where they may be offered the opportunity to engage in excess drinking, smoking, etc. you choose to either take or not take the pill. you choose to either inject the needle or not inject that needle. you choose to drink that alcohol."," Addiction is a choice not a disease : at least initially. there is a time in everyone s life where they may be offered the opportunity to engage in excess drinking, smoking, etc. you choose to either take or not take the pill. you choose to either inject the needle or not inject that needle. you choose to drink that alcohol.","Taking drugs is not always a victimless crime, as drug users can harm others.","do you consider diseases to be only those things with tangible representations in the real world? meaning something which can be isolated and examined on some level, like a bacteria or a virus or a patch of cancerous skin cells or a particular brain formation even the absence of something like a depressed person missing their correct balance of neurotransmitters? because a great deal of mental disorders psychopathologies would not meet that criteria. there are many debilitating conditions which have no physical representation in reality. it would be nice if you could take someone with ocd, put them in an mri, and say, 'you see this bump right here? that's your ocd. ' unfortunately most conditions like this don't work that way. also . . . if someone is regularly taking a substance drugs for a long time, then goes off that substance, the nerve dendrites which normally recieve the neurotransmitters produced by taking the drug can actually start to grow seeking more of the drug. imagine the dendrites are like garage doors that drugs use to park their cars. if you deprive those garage doors of cars, they will start making more garage doors in the hopes of enticing more cars to park in them. it's a literal ramping up of the craving for more drugs that someone who has not been taking a lot of drugs wont feel. and when the next time there's a big flood of cars, well look at all these nice new garages to house them all.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i don't think it's fair to say that there is a 'choice' between taking or not taking the pill. for example, if you're in a situation where you're going to take the pill, you're not going to be able to take it. it's not like you can't take it, you just have to take a pill.","i think you're confusing 'choice' with 'disease.'if you have a choice, it's not a disease. it's a choice.","i don't think it's a victimless crime, but i do think it is a responsibility of the individual to be responsible for their own actions. for example, if someone is a victim of a crime, they are responsible for the consequences of their actions. however, if they are a victim, then they have a responsibility to take responsibility for their actions as well."
" If male privilege exists, then so does female privilege","off the top of my head, here are a few examples. girls tend to outperform boys in school. males are much more likely to be victims of violence. male parental rights are significantly less. many sharehouse rental accommodation is female only. there are female only scholarships and grants."," If male privilege exists, then so does female privilege : off the top of my head, here are a few examples. girls tend to outperform boys in school. males are much more likely to be victims of violence. male parental rights are significantly less. many sharehouse rental accommodation is female only. there are female only scholarships and grants.",Men and women are biologically different and thus they play different roles in society.,"i m curious about your definition of female privilege. are you saying that there is at least one instance in modern western society where women have an unfair advantage over men? if that s the case, i think it d be hard for anyone to disagree with you. or, are you saying that the privileges that women have are the same amount of privileges that men have, and therefore are disproportionally not talked about? i m not trying to change your view, i m just wondering where your goalpost is, whether it s that females have any privileges men don t have, or that females have the same amount of privileges unique to their gender that men do. lastly, in the majority of the world, females are still very much disadvantaged much more than male counterparts. if you agree with that statement, then i think it d be worth it to refine your op to being confined to western societies. my family is from china, for example, and i think it d be very hard to claim privilege of being female as something that needed to be talked about.","i don't think this is the case. there is a huge difference between men and women in high school, and there is also a large difference between women and men in college. i think it's fair to say that women are more likely to be victims of violence than men, but that doesn't mean that women aren't victims of domestic violence.","i think it's important to note that the term 'privilege' is used to refer to the lack of male privilege in america. for example, in the united states, there is no'male privilege' or 'female privilege' in the sense that there is a'male' privilege in the u. s. that is, it is not a 'female' privilege. it is a term used to describe a group of people who are more likely to be victims of violence than the group of individuals who are less likely to have violence. this is not to say that there isn't male privilege, it just means that the group that is most likely to suffer from violence is the one who is the victim of violence.",i'm not sure what you mean by 'different roles in society.

" Instead of teaching youth to ""not judge"" we should be teaching them *how* to judge with kindness, mercy, logic, and fairness.","let me start by explaining what i mean when i say judge in this context. i am a father of a 5 year old girl and as anyone who's spent a lot of time with babies and young children, i want to help guide her through life and give her the tools to interpret the world around her. when we see a child behaving very poorly in public there are times when i choose to speak with her about what's happening. at the onset of this moment, when we are going to voice our thoughts about the behavior of others, whether it's my daughter and i, you by yourself in your head, or anyone in really any circumstance, we are entering a judgmental space by it's literal definition. any way to frame, or speak about some else's actions requires judgments to be made. our society has made the word 'judgmental' have strong negative connotations, and i believe people are uncomfortable with using others as teaching opportunities for fear of being 'judgmental' here's an example of what i'm talking about. daughter and i see a child screaming in the market, jumping up and down creating a massive scene, hitting their parent ect i'll ask my daughter 'why do you think they're being so terrible' i insert the view i'm teaching, that the behavior is terrible, so judgment is made but begin a dialogue. normally she'll say 'they're mad' or something like that, and we'll talk about things that make us mad, what might have this other child mad, i'll say something like 'i get mad, you get mad, everyone get's mad sometimes, it's ok to be mad but that's not how we act when we're mad right?

 Voting isn't actually productive or necessary,"however, i just can't shake the feeling that it doesn't really do anything. my singular vote doesn't mean anything. the electoral college and what my state is held by matters. like, i'm in texas so my vote for beto isn't gonna matter because my district is so gerrymandered that my liberal section of the state is partioned out with smaller, conservative west texas. i have voted democrat in every past election and it doesn't matter because the state is held by republicans. i'm not here to debate republican vs democrat by the way. cmv."," Voting isn't actually productive or necessary : however, i just can't shake the feeling that it doesn't really do anything. my singular vote doesn't mean anything. the electoral college and what my state is held by matters. like, i'm in texas so my vote for beto isn't gonna matter because my district is so gerrymandered that my liberal section of the state is partioned out with smaller, conservative west texas. i have voted democrat in every past election and it doesn't matter because the state is held by republicans. i'm not here to debate republican vs democrat by the way. cmv.",i don't think my vote matters in this election.,everyone seems to feel this way when it comes to election day but we so easily lose track of the link to the the actions behaviors of these officials throughout the rest of the term. lets assume you are super cynical about politics and you feel that all politicians are cheats and liars. they are still elected officials and and the end of the day have to pay lip service to the voters and make it look like they care about their constituents. that need to put on the air of caring for the people will influence the way that they are writing legislation and making deals which actually benefits people. maybe it is a 80 greed 20 social benefit kind of deal but imagine if those same people did not have to care about voters then it would be 100 greed all the time in which case you lose that 20 benefit. knowing that people are at least generally watching does have an effect. so even with a cynical view of the government it is super important to maintain voting as a healthy institution. the less that people care about politics the less that politicians will care about people and the most direct avenue for expressing care about politics is voting. if you are less cynical about politics then the rate of return for the value of voting only goes up.,the electoral college is meant to be a check against the power of the states. your vote doesn't matter because it doesn't really matter. it matters because you don't have the power to influence the outcome of a presidential election.,"i agree with you. however, i think it's important to remember that there are a lot of people who don't vote, and that they don't have the means to vote. for example, if you don't want to vote, you're not going to vote in the next election. you're going to have to vote for the next president, and you're also going to be voting for the people who have the power to do so. it's not just a matter of whether or not you vote, it's about how you vote. if you're in a swing state, you can vote for whoever you want, but you can't vote for who you want to represent.",you don't have to vote for beto. you can vote for any candidate you want. you just have to make sure you vote for the person you want to represent.

 I believe nudity should not be illegal,"so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic."," I believe nudity should not be illegal : so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic.",I believe that public nudity should be completely legal.,"honestly my first thought, what if ladies leave snail trails on park benches and weird dudes with boners get their pre on stuff that we'll all touch?

 Public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a major part of the base curriculum.,"if you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . also, i m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. i m not talking about teaching kids a few basic social skills. productivity, stability, cooperation, families and relationships are all greatly dependent on having a healthy understanding of one's own emotions and an understanding of how emotions work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on subjects of mental health and happiness because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. this is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. and teaching the foundations of that science to students as they live with emotional responses as a constant and resonating force in their own minds and as they interact with others in any all situation s could very likely improve productivity and senses of fulfillment and belonging for millions of people and generations to come. i should also note that saying 'math and english' was not specific. i was just bringing up two

responsibility of the parents. schools are good for teaching standardized information to lots of kids at once. the mental health aspects i think are more person specific. people respond to different

people who are struggling with mental health, but they don't have the time or resources to do so. the problem is that we don't need to teach people how to think critically about their mental health. we need to learn how to deal with anxiety and depression and how to cope with social situations. that's not to say that we shouldn't teach kids how to do these things, but it's important to realize that it's not the only field that needs to be taught.","i don't think it's a good idea to have the science of emotion as a part of the curriculum. i think it should be taught in a science class, but

the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. i don't think that's the case. i would argue that a lot of people don't have a good understanding of their own emotions, but that's not the problem. the problem is that mental health isn't just about how people react to certain stimuli, it's about how they react to those stimuli, and how they respond to the stimuli. for example, if you're in a relationship with someone, you're not going to be able to tell if they're happy or not. you're going to have to make sure that you're

til . the founders could not have imagined the world we live in today or its challenges, and the document is written as such. flawed solutions like the electoral college were created to solve problems of the 18th century that are irrelevant in the 21st. the founding fathers saw tyrannical government as the biggest threats to the rights of individuals, and wrote the constitution to protect those rights. that was logical in their day, but that is not the threat that those of us in modern democracies face. tyrannical companies taking from an article that's currently on the front page are the primary threat to individual rights and freedoms, and our government and constitution is not equipped to deal with that threat. i'm sure i'll get into more specific critiques in the comments, but that buildup of history and precedent makes justice incredibly difficult to come by in many instances and needs revision. if you haven't, i'd urge you to read the text. it takes like 20 minutes for the main text; probably 40 60 with amendments and is available everywhere. one of the main arguments that will likely be raised that will not change my view is the political will difficulty argument. i know it would be hard or impossible to make happen, especially given current politics."," The US needs a Constitutional Convention : hopefully this isn't too common a topic on cmv; the last post to put it this way was 2 years ago and more recent ones were more narrowly defined and are nearly a year old themselves . it had a great run it's the oldest constitution in continuous use, but most modern constitutions are written to be updated more frequently and actually are. ours is only really updated by supreme court decisions, with only 2 amendments being ratified in the last 50 years one of which was first proposed in 1789!

Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law,"my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law : my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.",I think abortion should be 100% legal everywhere.,"sorry, u asianviolinist98 your submission has been removed for breaking rule b: you must personally hold the view and demonstrate that you are open to it changing . a post cannot be on behalf of others, playing devil's advocate, or 'soapboxing'. see the wiki page for more information if you would like to appeal, message the moderators by clicking this link please note that multiple violations will lead to a ban, as explained in our moderation standards","i don't think it's fair to say that a fetus is a living thing. it's not. it is not a human being, it's a person.","i'm going to try to change your view a bit by arguing that roe v. wade was a bad decision. the constitution says life begins at conception. it says the mother has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. it doesn't say that the fetus is a living thing. it just says that it is not a human being.","i think it's important to remember that the constitution says life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do you say a fetus is not alive? i don't think you can argue that abortion is premated murder."
 Racial information should be removed from college and job applications.,"i think it's absurd that it's done and it's not equal opportunity. people say by doing this that you're benefiting white people but i'm not sure how that's true. the argument can be made on financial assistance with how much money they're are assisted with based on race, however that should be determined after the applicant is accepted."," Racial information should be removed from college and job applications. : i think it's absurd that it's done and it's not equal opportunity. people say by doing this that you're benefiting white people but i'm not sure how that's true. the argument can be made on financial assistance with how much money they're are assisted with based on race, however that should be determined after the applicant is accepted.",I think affirmative action is wrong and should be abolished.,i have 2 point. 1 is that it's used as a statistical tool. where they want to know how many of a specific race or gender is applied or attending so that info can be used for various things. one thing that info is used for is to make sure that an equal opportunity is presented for all. like a collage that leans toward accepting students of a particular race. this information would make it harder for schools to selectively pick from highschool's using the methodology that you can dertermine within reasonablity a persons race economic level from the school they went to that have a higher chance of giving them a student of a race economic level that they want. 2 it is used for pr. one of the main things that collages love to talk about is how diverse they are. to avoid the 'then they are picking them for there race' argument that could stem from that line of thinking it would be best to put it in terms of value to the other students. a student who can bring in firsthand knowledge of another culture and share that knowledge with other students would be more beneficial to the school to have them enrolled there. colleges are a business first so it makes sense for them to do what helps them the most.,"i don't think it's fair to say that it's unfair to the poor, but i think it is unfair to say the poor are disproportionately disadvantaged. for example, let's say that you're a white man and you're applying for a job, and you want to hire a black person. if you apply for the job, you're hiring a black man, and the black person is hiring a white woman, and they hire a white person. now, if you're looking for a black applicant, you need to apply for a white applicant, and that black applicant is hiring someone from a white background. the black applicant doesn't get a job because they're black, or because they are black. the white applicant is applying for the same job because he or she is black. they're applying to a job based on their race, and there's nothing wrong with that. the problem is that the white person isn't getting the job because of their race. if they're","i'm not sure if you're aware of this, but i think it's important to note that employers are not hiring people based on their race. for example, if a company hires a white person, they are hiring a black person because they are white. if they hire a white man, they're hiring a white woman because they're white. however, if you hire a black man because of his race, you're hiring someone because of their race, not because he's white. i don't think this is a good idea, but it's a good way to make sure that the hiring process is fair.",affirmative action isn't about helping people. it's about giving money to people who need it. it doesn't help people who can't afford it.
 A joint account with a percentage-of-income (with a few other considerations) is the best way to split money,"i know this can have a lot of exceptions. please don't make your arguments about pointing out 2 or 3 exceptions that are technically true. i'll list a few to save the trouble: a person with reckless spending or addiction gambling issues should not have this split. significant inheritances should not necessarily have this split the extremely rich or extremely poor should not necessarily have this split massive debts massive differences in work time lots of other exceptions but for most people, i think this split is the best method. money has an economic value. if you compare the salary of a strategic consulting manager and a veterinarian assistant, you're going to get 200k versus 40k or something crazy. but in a relationship, i don't think economic value should necessarily be considered, unless the difference in income is so vast that one person's income is literally chump change i. e. 500k vs 30k . in a relationship, especially that of a marriage, the 'most important value' is time and effort of the individual. person1 makes 80k after taxes; person2 makes 40k. person1 would input 40k into their joint account, while person2 inputs 20k. as a result, in real money, person1 is providing more. person2 is also providing 50 . caveat. please read this caveat. let's say for example i make 100k and my partner makes 20k. i put in 50k and keep 50k while she puts in 10k and keeps 10k. unfortunately, that means that i get to live it up and have a pretty damn good life whereas she has to keep both savings and expenses under 800 per month. so why this view? 1. 2. provides freedom to both people and rewards high earners in exchange for providing more this allows both parties to win. 3. this makes their life much more difficult and makes them less capable of affording more. 4. gifts are more meaningful in a fully shared money situation, gifts are important but also become difficult to justify. makes for a difficult situation. 5. use your own money. no problem! want to buy a ps4?

without the jobs, you wouldn t get the reward. this is where a lot of rich people get depression. they have reached the peak and can t go any farther up. obviously find a job your interested in and can stick with so your brain can make you happy.","i don't think you're going to be able to change your view if you want to. i'm going to take a different approach to your view. you seem to think that people are slaves to their own desires, and that they should be free to do whatever they want with their life. i don't see how that is the case. i think it's important to realize that we are not slaves to our own desires. we are slaves for our own needs, and we are free to choose whatever we want to do with our life. if you think that everyone should have the right to do what they want, then i think you are right. however, i think that there is a difference between working to survive and working to make money. you are not entitled to any of the things you enjoy, but you are entitled to the things that you enjoy. and if you don't like those things, then you aren't entitled to them.","the problem with your view is that it assumes that people are forced to work to survive. in reality, that is not the case. people are not forced to do things just to survive, they do it because they want to. the problem is that people don't want to work because they don't have the money to do it. they want it because it's what they want. that's the problem with the idea that people need to work for money to be happy. it's not that there is no need for money, it's that there are people who need it to survive and want it to be a happy life.","i'm going to try to change your view by pointing out that working is enslaving people. i would argue that the idea of working to survive is not enslaving, but rather that it is a means to an end. if you don't have a job, you can't work, and if you do have a car, you have no job. but if you have a house, food, water, and education, then you can still work. it's not enslavement, it's just a way to make yourself feel better about yourself."

" Poe Dameron was not simply just wrong for questioning Admiral Holdo and taking action, nor was he the ""true villain"" of TLJ.","i think i maybe should've made this 'cmv: holdo should have done something to inspire all members of the resistance to trust in her and not come up with a plan of their own especially considering poe's history .

 Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing,"for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me? ' and you're reluctant to tell them the real reason, you're probably using them and you should probably break up with them. response 1: 'as long as it's between consenting adults, there's nothing wrong with it and we shouldn't judge them too harshly. ' consent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an action to be ethical. that is, for a relationship to be ethical, it must at a minimum be consensual, but it takes more than that. it must also be genuinely good in the long term for all parties involved. for instance, it wouldn't be ethical for two completely incompatible people to date each other just because they're both terrified of being alone, even if they both consent to it. they could even hurt others if they have children. response 2: 'as long as you're upfront about your motives, you're in the clear. ' few people are willing to be so upfront, precisely because they're aware of how much it makes them sound like a sociopath. 'i had a bad breakup and i'm just looking for a rebound. you cool with that? ' few people say that sort of thing upfront. and if you are upfront, sure, it may lessen your burden of guilt, but that doesn't mean you should be doing it in the first place. if you sell someone placebo drugs, and you tell them upfront, 'hey these drugs probably won't do a damn thing. i'm just trying to make a cheap buck. ' and they buy them anyway, sure, that's better than lying to them about it. but isn't it even better not to sell placebo drugs at all? similarly, if someone's just a rebound for you, it's better if you tell them that upfront rather than make them think they're special, but isn't it better still not to use someone that way in the first place? besides, our motives are often obscure even to ourselves. we may not realize someone was a rebound until the relationship is over. if you're not really, truly excited about someone after a few dates, then what are you still doing with them? response 3: sex is no big deal. it's just our messed up society that puts such an unhealthy emphasis on it. our society probably does have an unhealthy attitude toward sex. but sex is a big deal, and it's not just another activity like skiing. otherwise, we can't explain why forced sex is a special kind of crime. here's what i mean. rape is a serious crime, one that can potentially cause serious psychological damage. likewise, it's a serious crime for an adult to have sex with a child. part of the reason is that they can't meaningfully consent to sex. but why is meaningful consent necessary in this case? young children can't meaningfully consent to getting their hair cut or being taken skiing, either, but that's no crime. rape and sex with children are evil because it's a particularly heinous type of violation, perhaps a violation of something that should be sacred. it's not just an activity that our society places too much emphasis on. sex is intimate in a way that can cause lasting psychological damage if forced upon someone. presumably this is because sex is so deeply rooted in our biology that we can't help but have certain psychological reactions to it. sex does something to you, and you can't necessarily help it no matter how enlightened you are. or even if you can completely separate sex from all the messy emotions, you can't know if your casual partner is capable of doing the same, because you don't know them well. if sex is special, perhaps even sacred, we're playing with fire if we act as if it's no big deal. we risk hurting ourselves and others psychologically, even if it's all perfectly consensual. addendum: there's some part of me that still feels like i'm being ridiculous and unrealistic about my approach to dating, but my conscience won't be clear unless i can see why. or if i'm not being ridiculous, then at least i'll feel more confident about refusing to date anyone for any reason who doesn't meet my possibly unrealistic standards. i can't seem to settle this on my own, so i would appreciate some outside perspective and wisdom."," Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing : for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me?

' and they buy them anyway, sure, that's better than lying to them about it. but isn't it even better not to sell placebo drugs at all? similarly, if someone's just a rebound for you, it's better if you tell them that upfront rather than make them think they're special, but isn't it better still not to use someone that way in the first place? besides, our motives are often obscure even to ourselves. we may not realize someone was a rebound until the relationship is over. if you're not really, truly excited about someone after a few dates, then what are you still doing with them? response 3: sex is no big deal. it's just our messed up society that puts such an unhealthy emphasis on it. our society probably does have an unhealthy attitude toward sex. but sex is a big deal, and it's not just another activity like skiing. otherwise, we can't explain why forced sex is a special kind of crime. here's what i mean. rape is a serious crime, one that can potentially cause serious psychological damage. likewise, it's a serious crime for an adult to have sex with a child. part of the reason is that they can't meaningfully consent to sex. but why is meaningful consent necessary in this case? young children can't meaningfully consent to getting their hair cut or being taken skiing, either, but that's no crime. rape and sex with children are evil because it's a particularly heinous type of violation, perhaps a violation of something that should be sacred. it's not just an activity that our society places too much emphasis on. sex is intimate in a way that can cause lasting psychological damage if forced upon someone. presumably this is because sex is so deeply rooted in our biology that we can't help but have certain psychological reactions to it. sex does something to you, and you can't necessarily help it no matter how enlightened you are. or even if you can completely separate sex from all the messy emotions, you can't know if your casual partner is capable of doing the same, because you don't know them well. if sex is special, perhaps even sacred, we're playing with fire if we act as if it's no big deal. we risk hurting ourselves and others psychologically, even if it's all perfectly consensual. addendum: there's some part of me that still feels like i'm being ridiculous and unrealistic about my approach to dating, but my conscience won't be clear unless i can see why. or if i'm not being ridiculous, then at least i'll feel more confident about refusing to date anyone for any reason who doesn't meet my possibly unrealistic standards. i can't seem to settle this on my own, so i would appreciate some outside perspective and wisdom.","Many ""innocent"" human actions are in fact deeply immoral.","i take issue with your title's phrasing:casual dating and casual sex is inherently dehumanizing i don't expect this road to lead anywhere to a delta but humans in their natural habitats as can be seen with tribal cultures around the world treat sex very differently. that's not to say that dating doesn't exist but sex is seen very differently, as is the culture surrounding it. i would say it can't be inherently dehumanizing if our natural views toward sex and natural inclinations lean elsewhere.","i don't think it's so much a question of 'why' as it is about 'why'. it's about whether you want to be a part of a relationship, whether you like it or not. if you don't like it, then you shouldn't date it. but if you do, then it's up to you to decide whether or not you're okay with it, and if you're ok with that, then so be it.","i agree with you that casual dating can be dehumanizing. however, i think it is important to recognize that it is not just a means to an end, it is also a means for an end. for example, if you are dating someone for a long time, and you are in a relationship for a short period of time, you are using that person as a substitute for a feeling. if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using the person as an emotional crutch? i don't think that's the case, but i do think it's important to remember that casual sex is not an end to a relationship. it is a way for you to express your feelings about a person, and to express them in a way that makes them feel good about themselves. casual sex can be a way to express that feeling, but it's not the only way to do that. it's",i think you're confusing consent with consent. consent is not a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an action to be ethical. it's not a requirement to consent.

' and it makes me angry, because i want to help, and i don't believe that the best way for me to help is just go bask in my privilege and die. i want to say, i'm here for this, and i want to help, but you have to let me be an individual who is imperfect and not just 'an evil white dude'. ugh. i know this is rambling and probably incoherent the more i type, i'm getting emotional. anyway, please try to change my view. i don't want to keep feeling shitty and wind up a bitter, trump voter in 2020 lol . ps: i'm going to be here for the next few hours because i'm taking this seriously and will reply in good faith. i've got to step away for a little now but i'll check back in a few hours and reply some more.","as a white man, i'm struggling with the idea of equality.","as a white man, you need to understand that the entire purpose of the vastly liberal media at this point in time is to make you feel marginalized and unworthy of where you fall in the socioeconomic arena. through no fault of your own, you were born a white male in america. yes, this gives you an inherent advantage when compared to other situations, but it is up to the individual as to what they do with that situation. you can either continue to pout because the media tells you that you're some kind of monster who has no place in current society, and try to find a way to force yourself into their narrative, or you can write your own, and realize you're in control of your impact. go join the peace corps for a year, volunteer at an inner city school, join big brothers, just go out and help people especially children. the more children you can help, the more will grow up disagreeing with the narrative that white male men are the root of all evil.","i think it's important to realize that there are a lot of things in life that people don't know about. for example, i'm white, and i don't have any friends who are white. i can't speak for everyone, but i can speak for myself. i'm a white man, and while i'm not proud of who i am, i can also be proud of the accomplishments i've made as a white woman. i am proud of my accomplishments as a woman, and proud of what i've accomplished.","i don't think you have a right to be ashamed of who you are, but i do think you should be proud of your privilege. i'm a white man, and i've been privileged to be born into a white family. i've never felt ashamed of my privilege, but that doesn't mean i shouldn't feel proud of who i am. it just means that i can't be a perfect white man who never offends anyone accidentally, because society is done with me.","i don't think it's fair to say that you should just go bask in your privilege and die. you should focus on what you want to do with your life, not what you think you should do with it."

 Pride parades should have less NSFW content,"however, i think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. to me, pride is about celebrating the lgbt community and promoting acceptance and understanding. it's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. i think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. i'm not out to my family, but bringing them to pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. but generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at pride, this is pretty much out of the question."," Pride parades should have less NSFW content : however, i think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. to me, pride is about celebrating the lgbt community and promoting acceptance and understanding. it's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. i think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. i'm not out to my family, but bringing them to pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. but generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at pride, this is pretty much out of the question.",i don't think pride should have so much content.,are you of the view that sex and our bodies are unnatural and that it is immodest to exhibit them?,"i don't think it's fair to say that people should be allowed to wear whatever they want, but i do think it would be a good idea for the lgbt community to have a pride parade. i don't know about you, but there's a lot of pride parades in the us, and i think that's a good thing. i'm not saying that it's a bad idea, but it's not a bad thing.","i don't think it's fair to say that all parades should have more nudity than they do, but i think that's a bit of an oversimplification. for example, there are a lot of parades where people are allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies, and there are parades that are only allowed to be open to the public. i don't know if this is fair to you, but it seems to me that there are some parades in the u. s. where there are no parades at all.","i don't think this is really the point of pride. i think it's more of a celebration of the diversity of the lgbt community. it's a place where people can express their sexuality, and to be honest, it's not a place for all people to express themselves. but it's also a place to express their identity, and it's an outlet for people who don't want to be ashamed of who they are. i'm not saying it's wrong, i'm saying that it's the right thing to do, but i think there's a lot more to it than just being proud of who you are."

 The diving/flopping that occurs in soccer is detrimental to the game and FIFA should do something about it.,"i and many other of my casual soccer fans have watched a significant portion of the world cup this year. the way i see it, the world cup is a potential stage to attract millions of people as fans of the sport, and i m sure it does a relatively good job at it. on top of that i ve seen a number of near breakaway opportunities where, at the sniff of contact, the offensive player goes down instead of attempting to play through contact as well as other similar situations . if players should be punished for embellishing acting fines would likely be the best means of doing so. now i understand some teams pay their players more than others so a universal fine number might not work. i m thinking maybe a small percentage of their compensation from their teams? cmv!"," The diving/flopping that occurs in soccer is detrimental to the game and FIFA should do something about it. : i and many other of my casual soccer fans have watched a significant portion of the world cup this year. the way i see it, the world cup is a potential stage to attract millions of people as fans of the sport, and i m sure it does a relatively good job at it. on top of that i ve seen a number of near breakaway opportunities where, at the sniff of contact, the offensive player goes down instead of attempting to play through contact as well as other similar situations . if players should be punished for embellishing acting fines would likely be the best means of doing so. now i understand some teams pay their players more than others so a universal fine number might not work. i m thinking maybe a small percentage of their compensation from their teams? cmv!",i think soccer players should be punished for embellishing goals.,"one of the big issues with soccer is that there is such a high premium on scoring opportunities. it isn't uncommon for a game to only have 1 or 2 goals, and those goals coming on only a handful more scoring opportunities. with the premium on goals 1 goal can easily be deciding, particularly if the leading team adopts an all out defense strategy , the incentive to try and draw penalties either free kicks or penalty shots which can be scoring opportunities without any additional effort by the kicking team is massive. the best way for soccer to deal with this would be to reduce the benefit of flopping. that might mean taking steps to increase scoring so that 1 goal won't necessarily be deciding. that might mean reducing the benefit of free kicks e. g. you can dribble out with possession, but not organize a set piece . that might mean moving back the penalty kick so it isn't nearly as valuable in it's own right.","i don't think it's fair to say that the players involved in the game should be paid the same as the teams involved. it's not fair to assume that players who are involved in their team's team's game will receive the same amount of compensation as those who are not involved. if a player is involved in a game, then they should be compensated the same way as the other players.","i think you're missing the point of the world cup. it's not just about the game, it's about the culture of the game. if you're a soccer fan, you're going to see a lot of flopping and acting in soccer.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to remember that soccer is not a sport, it's a game of strategy. it's not about scoring goals. the goal is to score a goal, and it's supposed to be scored. but it doesn't work that way. if you're going to try to score goals, you need to make sure that you're scoring a goal in a way that makes it more difficult for the opponent to score."

Alcoholics Anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasn't tried to improve it's system since it's inception,"i have a friend who has been attending aa meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a dui for the record i don't know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or 'choose' jailtime and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not aa works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program. below i've listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner. this means that i m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change. 1. we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable. 2. came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understoodhim. 4. made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. admitted to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character. 7. humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings. 8. made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. sought through prayer and mation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. 12. my current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30 s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases. here are some of my thoughts on the matter. first up, as many have pointed out, there's a whole lot of god involved throughout the 12 steps 6 direct references and 7 if you count 2 , i'm not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend. if a person does not believe in god they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety. if alcoholism is a disease then why does aa treat it simply as a matter of will power? i wouldn't try to treat cancer with prayer alone, and for the record there are various medical treatments for alcoholism. there is also a stigma of personal failure when people relapse which doesn't make sense for a couple of reasons. first, if it's a disease then people are sick which means that blaming them for not being able to control their health adds a layer of shame which can only do harm to the person's primary goal of getting sober. in turn this will increase the time to get sober because it will add time to get over that shame before starting again. shame does nothing to help get a person back on track as far as i can tell. second, you would never assign blame to a person with cancer who has gone into remission and then had the cancer come back, why would we do the same for literally any other illness? we wouldn't accept that from any other sort of treatment. if we didn't collect that information we would still have the same poor treatment of hiv that we did in the 80s and 90s, same goes for cancer, and just about any other illness you can name. finally it seems that aa believes it s program is a one size fits all program when we know that many ailments require different treatments for different people. this is especially true for ailments that affect people mentally which i think it s safe to say that addiction falls under that same umbrella. people deal with various addictions in different ways, why aa treats alcohol as a one size fits all approach i can t say, maybe i m wrong, but based on the text of their twelve steps and twelve promises that doesn t seem to be the case. instead they seem to say that the only reason people fail is because the fail to give themselves over fully to the program which seems to be very very odd.","Alcoholics Anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasn't tried to improve it's system since it's inception : i have a friend who has been attending aa meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a dui for the record i don't know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or 'choose' jailtime and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not aa works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program. below i've listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner. this means that i m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change. 1. we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable. 2. came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understoodhim. 4. made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. admitted to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character. 7. humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings. 8. made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. sought through prayer and mation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. 12. my current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30 s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases. here are some of my thoughts on the matter. first up, as many have pointed out, there's a whole lot of god involved throughout the 12 steps 6 direct references and 7 if you count 2 , i'm not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend. if a person does not believe in god they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety. if alcoholism is a disease then why does aa treat it simply as a matter of will power?

 Laissez Faire is the ideal Governmental/Societal Structure,"as morality cannot be imposed, and the smart, or selfish, or rich will always have advantage any system, however vetted, will produce unintended consequences. the more complex the regulation or system, the harder it is to evaluate the success. welfare, government oversight, banking and industry regulation, healthcare and similar policies inevitably fail to produce better results than the self correcting selfish incentives of competition. for example: the recent fiduciary rule attempted to standardize compensation for advisory services on asset management. this was meant to be a more strict policy compared to a disclosure based, potentially conflicted, model in which suitability was the standard. the problem which was attempted to be addressed was: broker has fund a and b which are both suitable, but picks a for revenue purposes. the solution was, fund a and b must pay the same. simply put . the reality was that the industry broadly increased fees holistically, to maintain revenue levels but collect it another way. average fees went up. in the chaos of the administration change, the standard was ultimately struck down. it seems to me, that ultimately, people learn from experience, and in the learning process even systemically, many problems self correct from individual incentive. a social darwinism of behavior, as evolution has shown us the impact of selective competitive advantage with iteration, why can that not apply also to society?

 There is nothing wrong with the encouraging/ reinforcment of masculinity.,"i often see people criticizing phrases such as 'man up! ,' 'be a man! ,' etc, and claiming these are bad for young people men and women to hear. historically and biologically, men have been and are more combative than women so if a woman needs to be combative to accomplish something, i see no problem is saying 'be a man. ' this also applies to other traits such as independence. as an aside, some may argue that ideas of masculinity and femininity are purely socially construed and that people only act certain ways because of societal influence. i wholeheartedly disagree masculine and feminine traits largely have to do with the presence of sex hormones acting on the nervous system. so the idea that phrases like 'be a man' need to go away because it's keeping together a negative social construct are unfounded. if anything is unclear, i will be happy to elaborate on any ideas in the comments."," There is nothing wrong with the encouraging/ reinforcment of masculinity. : i often see people criticizing phrases such as 'man up! ,' 'be a man! ,' etc, and claiming these are bad for young people men and women to hear. historically and biologically, men have been and are more combative than women so if a woman needs to be combative to accomplish something, i see no problem is saying 'be a man.

 Rap is lower quality music and is overrated.,"before i get into this, let me be clear what i'm not trying to say : all rap is bad. rap takes no talent. people shouldn't listen to rap at all. people who listen to rap are less intellegent. all the problems i list are exclusive to rap and not other genres of music. ok, now let's get into this : 1. rap uses less people to create, which does not always indicate, but usually indicates less effort overall . obviously, the more people working on something, the more hours that can be put into something. that doesn't mean one person can't create something good, but the likelihood of an individual creating something good is statically less than that of a group. 2. most rap songs use rhymes, which can alter what the creator wants the song to mean . the creator of a song might want to portray a message, express an emotion s , or cause the listener to critically think in some way. since many rap songs rely heavily on rhyming their lyrics, they have to alter the words of the songs in order to rhyme. while this can be entertaining, the meaning of the song is often lost, misunderstood or not taken seriously. 3. rap relies too heavily on vocals and not a variety of instruments . that's not to say that rap never uses anything else, but vocals are always at the forefront; everything but the vocals is just background noise, vocals are emphasized. this means that rap as a genre lacks variety within artists and between artists. it becomes more difficult to distinguish between rap songs, and they start to blend together. this begins to ruin the perception of what's good and what's bad. on top of that, if the vocals are bad, the whole song is bad vs. if one instrument were bad, the entire song is not necessarily ruined. 4. rap is easier to learn than other genres that use other instruments, and most anyone can do it if try tried. there's no hand eye coordination with vocals as with a guitar or piano. on top of that, traditional vocals require the singer to use certain pitches consistently and at loud capacities and to a beat. this makes it easier to learn than other interments or vocals. meaning, people without natural talent can start rapping, and lesser quality songs can be made in abundance. of course, a rapper can spend an equal or greater amount of time practicing as any other musician. but remember, people can also get really good at sitting down and standing up, that doesn't equate to quality. i try to be objective, but i obviously wouldn't be making this argument if i didn't have a bias. i do enjoy some rap, i'm not completely adverse to it. other genres have similar problems, i would say the same of a lot of pop or country music. let me know what you guys think, am i way off base?

 The right wing in the US shouldn't whine about identity politics since they also engage in identity politics; identity politics for white people.,"let's just disregard the fact that 'average voter' generally means the white voter, in this case. it starts with these communities that collectively complain about their problems. my issue with this is that this seems to be a very ahistorical view. blacks were enslaved based on their identity. women weren't allowed to own their land based on their identity. it's incredibly troublesome to me that people ignore this. because it certainly wasn't for no reason. and it isn't like the fight is over on any of these fronts. blacks are still facing issues with police brutality. women are dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace and not finding adequate help when they want to come forward. ice are literally asking mexican people for their papers. why should they not band together and advocate for each other?

 The method of punishment should change,"'whatever undeserved evil you inflict upon another within the people, you inflict upon yourself' kant murderers should be murdered, exactly how they committed the murder. killed someone by throwing rocks at them? death by stoning. killed by shooting? criminal should be shot. thieves should lose all their property, rapists should be raped. this may be an extreme form of justice, but i believe it is one of the only just system. you see completely sick, sadistic cruel people, that only get punished by being behind bars?

 There is no difference between a man hitting a woman and vice-versa.,"my view is based off the assertion that men and women should be treated equally on the principles of gender equality. the cultural norm that men should not hit women is wrong. men should not have an obligation to take assault from a woman based solely on gender. gender should not be taken into account in violence, save for exceptions. let me give a few examples. scenario 1 gt; female hits male, male hits in self defense. female is at wrong because she assaulted someone. scenario 2 gt; female hits male, male knocks out female. both parties at wrong, male used too much force. scenario 3 gt; male hits female, female knocks out male. both parties at wrong, female used too much force. gender does not come into account in any of these instances."," There is no difference between a man hitting a woman and vice-versa. : my view is based off the assertion that men and women should be treated equally on the principles of gender equality. the cultural norm that men should not hit women is wrong. men should not have an obligation to take assault from a woman based solely on gender. gender should not be taken into account in violence, save for exceptions. let me give a few examples. scenario 1 gt; female hits male, male hits in self defense. female is at wrong because she assaulted someone. scenario 2 gt; female hits male, male knocks out female. both parties at wrong, male used too much force. scenario 3 gt; male hits female, female knocks out male. both parties at wrong, female used too much force. gender does not come into account in any of these instances.",Men and women should be treated equally in all situations,"i disagree with the notion of 'knocking someone out who hitted you is wrong'. if someone literally jumps me, i'm using all my strength to get out of the situation, not 'just enough so he she isn't knocked out'.","i think there is a difference between being able to hit a woman and being able not to hit them. for example, if a woman hits a man, she is at fault for hitting him. if a man hits a woman, he is not at fault.","i'm not going to argue that there is no difference between a man hitting a woman and a woman hitting a man, but i'm going to point out that the difference is that a man hits a woman in self defense, whereas a woman hits a man in self defence.","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i think it's important to note that this is a matter of perspective. in a situation where a woman is attacked by a man, she may not be able to defend herself from the attack, but she is able to use her body to prevent the attack. in situations where a man is attacked in self defense, he may be unable to defend himself against a woman, but he may not have been able to protect himself against the attack in the first place. in cases where the attacker is a man and the victim is a woman who has been assaulted, there is a chance that the attacker could have prevented the attack by taking advantage of the situation. in scenarios where the victim was a woman and the attacker was a man who was not a man, the attacker may have been unable to protect themselves from the attacker. in scenario 3, the attacker would have had to take advantage of a man's body to defend themselves against the"
" If abortions were not an option, then everyone would agree that fetuses are human lives.","they have human dna distinct from their parents. they have organs which, while they are still developing, are self contained and distinct from their mothers organs. they respond to external stimuli independently of their mothers. the most prevalent arguments for the idea that fetuses are merely a part of the mother s body seem to be these, so i ll address them here: 1. the fetus is entirely dependent on the mother. it certainly is. however, newborn babies are also entirely dependent on the mother. not just financially, but in a very literal sense. they, like fetuses, get food directly from the mother s body. is it ok to kill babies because they re inconvenient to the mother?

change my mind.",i believe that abortion is wrong because newborn babies are human beings.,"you are making the assumption that 'human life' is a binary concept. biologically, this is false. human life comes into existence gradually and it also ceases to exist gradually. if somebody's brain is destroyed but their body is kept alive in an icu, that person is still dead for all practical purposes. switching off the icu machines does not constitute murder. but what if only 90 of the brain is destroyed, and the person is capable of some basic reflexes but otherwise a vegetable? are they dead or alive? the answer is that they are more alive, because human life is a continuum. but still barely alive. the legal system treats life as binary, not because this reflects reality, but because practically , it would be impossible to run a legal system where life was expressed in terms of percentages. it would also have some nasty side effects. living in a society where you constantly have to prove the degree of your aliveness in order to gain protections would be a terrifying experience for most people. in short, binary life is a legal fiction, but a useful legal fiction. but once we have acknowledged this we also have to acknowledge that we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, and that where exactly we draw that line is arbitrary. however, we can use biology to give us a meaningful ballpark . drawing the line at conception is silly from a biological perspective, because we know that a person's 'essence' resides in the brain, and the brain doesn't develop until later.","i'm not sure why you think it's ok to kill a baby when it's already a human being. it's not the same as killing a fetus because it's a human, it's the fact that it is a human.","i would argue that fetuses are not a separate human life from their parents. they are not independent of their mothers body, but they are independent of the mother's body. therefore, the fetus is not a human life.",i think you're missing the point. the mother has a right to control her own body. she doesn't have the right to kill a baby. i don't think you can argue that the fetus is a part of the mother's body.

' instead, both partners should engage in these activities when they both feel that they are ready for them. they should get married when they're both confident that this is the partner they want to spend the rest of their lives with. to me, a wedding is simply an opportunity to celebrate that love commitment you've created with friends and family. ultimately, marriage is a long term relationship that needs to be worked on and managed forever. it's not like you get married and start with a new relationship or you get married and all the relationship work vanishes. instead, you get married and a week later things should go back to being how they were before the stress of the wedding.","i'm not sure what you're talking about, but i'm going to try to change your view here. first off, you seem to be conflating the benefits of marriage with the costs of cohabitation. if you don't want to get married, you're going to have a lot of trouble getting a divorce. secondly, i think you're missing the point of marriage. marriage is a social contract. it's not a contract, it's a contract.","i think it's important to remember that marriage is a contract between two people. it's not just about sex, it's about marriage. if you want to raise children, you're going to have to go through a lot of paperwork, and that's going to be a lot harder to do.","i don't think you should get married before you have kids, but if you're planning on having kids, you should do it before you get married."

 there is a relative lack of respect and deference for the social sciences.,"we have a worldwide network of universities with countless sociology, anthropology, political science and critical theory departments, yet it seems like every ordinary person off the street feels equally qualified to speculate or offer opinions about human nature, culture, politics, etc. you just don't see the natural sciences treated the same way. if someone has an interesting thought pop into their head about biology or physics, they don't just assume that thought in its current state is equivalent to research. the curiosity that gets sparked about natural science always seems to lead to a google search, at least. it certainly doesn't seem like it to me. it seems that the most people are willing to do is shop around for statistical studies that support a position they have already determined all on their own to be correct. i totally understand why this is the case. when it comes to social science, everyone seems to believe that we all have access to the same data; we are all human, and we all have experienced belonging to a society. we also have a natural tendency to try to universalize our particular perspective. i think there is a very strong temptation to do this for the sake of our own ego nobody wants to be the villain, everybody wants to be the hero. i just think that it is interesting how rarely people realize that there are legions of professionals out there who do nothing but read, write and think about the topics that they have chewed over during the margins of their day. but what's even worse is how this ignorance carries itself into our social discourse. right now there is a serious accusation of partiality and bias against politically conservative students and faculty in university social science departments. the reason for this is really quite simple: objectivity requires detachment from the subject being studied, and this detachment leads to criticism of normative beliefs and institutions that are currently in power. given that the conservative position is all about maintaining the status quo against external threats, or even returning to an ideological vision of the past when these institutions were supposedly even stronger, conservatives are obviously going to feel particularly attacked by the process of critique. conversely, liberals leftists are going to embrace the results of objective critique and become political advocates for reform. any idea, be it politically conservative or liberal, can have its place if it actually holds up to disciplinary rigor. one example is the youtube personality 'sargon of akkad' aka carl benjamin a guy who invokes classical liberalism to attack feminists and other identity groups, even though he has never critically studied political philosophy beyond what provides him with convenient arguments to rile up his viewers. another even more insidious example is jordan peterson a psychologist !

'hey so what do you have down there? ' , or can be direct attacks towards your identity i. e. 'there's no such thing as non binary tho, you just want to feel special unique' . and that's not even getting into actual potential dangers with outing oneself. the problem is that although many people are honestly just looking to learn more, it can be hard to tell whether the person's intentions are good or bad. usually you're going to encounter people say it's not my job to educate you after they've already dealt with a number of others asking less than polite questions recently, and are less than excited to get into another potentially similar situation.","i think you're missing a fundamental part of the point of a culture. it's not that we don't want to connect with other cultures, it's that we want to learn about them. for example, if you're a white american, you're going to learn a lot about the history of the united states, culture, religion, and so on. if you are a black person, you'll learn more about the past than you do about the present.","i think you're misunderstanding the concept of 'do your own research'. i think it's important to understand that there is a huge gap between cis and non binary people. for example, i'm a cis woman and i have a lot of friends who are trans. i don't know a lot about them, but i do know that they are trans, and i know that there are trans people who are cis. i understand that it's not my job to educate them, and that's okay, but it's my responsibility to do my own research.","the problem with your argument is that it assumes that black people are more valuable than white people. i'm not going to argue against that, but i'm going to point out that your view is based on a false premise. black people have a higher chance of being successful in society than any other race. if you're a black person, you're more likely to be successful in life than a white person."

Taxation should be optional,"if people want to enjoy the benefits of roads,public parks, schools and social programs they should pay taxes. if they don't pay taxes they don't get to use these resources but they should not get arrested either. however, if i was a farmer who never used anything that taxes pay then i am basically paying for other people's happiness to my detriment. it does not make sense to forcefully take someone else's money and spend it on things that don't benefit them. i am willing to change my view on this issue.","Taxation should be optional : if people want to enjoy the benefits of roads,public parks, schools and social programs they should pay taxes. if they don't pay taxes they don't get to use these resources but they should not get arrested either. however, if i was a farmer who never used anything that taxes pay then i am basically paying for other people's happiness to my detriment. it does not make sense to forcefully take someone else's money and spend it on things that don't benefit them. i am willing to change my view on this issue.",I believe people who don't pay taxes should not be able to enjoy the things that they pay for.,"so everyone benefits from not being sick. things like herd immunity means that if enough people are vaccinated, everyone is protected even those who aren't vaccinated . fda and cdc both have roles in the development of vaccines and the epidemiological tracking of diseases. everyone benefits from that. how do you take away that benefit? make then sick?","i don't think taxes should be taken away, but i do think they should be. i think it's important to remember that taxation is not just a way to pay for things that don't benefit you, it's also a way for people to live their lives. a lot of people don't pay taxes because they don't want to live in a society that doesn't benefit them, but because they want to be able to live a lifestyle that benefits them. if taxes were taken away then there would be a lot more people who don't have the means to do so, and the people who do would have to pay taxes to live.","the problem with taxation is that it is not the government's job to pay for it, it is the people who pay it. if you don't pay taxes, then you aren't paying for it.","the problem with this view is that it assumes that people who don't pay taxes get to enjoy the benefits of roads,public parks, schools and social programs they pay for. if you are a farmer who never used anything that taxes pay, then you are basically paying for other people's happiness to your detriment. this is not the case. if i was a farmer, i would pay taxes, but i am not paying for the things that i pay for, and i am just paying for things that don't benefit me."

we should let people get comfortable with more gender conforming trans people that fit into cis society without requiring many changes, before we unleash the ey em genderfluid pansexual anarchocommunist demigirls i make fun of you 'cause i love you! . a few examples of strategies i'd like to see in the movement: redefine gender as something along the lines of 'if your birth certificate and sex hormones agree on one of 'male' or 'female', that is your gender. if not, you may self identify as either gender, and use the faculties of either gender, but may not participate in women's sports. ' this is, as the trump administration would say, 'grounded in science', while also being trans inclusive, and making at least some sense. it cedes some ground to the conservatives, while not really negatively affecting very many people's lives. i think it's a bad final definition for a variety of reasons, but i think it makes a decent starting point that is resistant to the conservative bogeyman of the weird creepy man that starts wearing a dress one day so he can use the women's room. i think that conservatives are imagining trans women as 'men in dresses' and trans men as 'women with buzzcuts'. so maybe we should make the image of trans people less 'weird androgynous in between folks' and more 'people who are basically the same as everyone else but changed their gender'. this is an example of something i'd like to see more of. we really have to stop minimizing people's concerns with the really thorny parts of the trans movement, like women's prisons, or women's sports. i think there are reasonable objections that we should take into account and think about , not just assume everyone raising them is a transphobic asshole. i am sure there are really good potential compromises on this stuff, but if we create a moratorium on anything that even kind of looks like transphobia from a distance, we're really hamstringing ourselves and there's no way we'll be able to find an effective solution that people are okay with.","i don't think mtf is a bigoted movement, but i think it's a lot more than that. i think the issue is that the movement has a lot to do with the fact that it's not just a movement, it's also a movement of people who want to change their gender identity. for example, i'm a transgender woman, and i don't want to be associated with a group of people that don't identify with me. i'm also a transgender man. i want to transition, and that's pretty much the only way i can do it. but i'm not going to try to change anyone's mind about it. i just want to make it clear that i am a trans woman and i'm willing to change my gender.","i'm not sure if it's a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights as it asks the rest of the population to change their behavior, and tells them that not only the things they say but the way they act are likely to end up in the 'bigot' category.","i'm not sure if this is a good idea, but i'm going to take a stab at it. i think it's important to remember that the movement is not a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights as it asks the rest of the population to change their behaviour. it's a movement that is trying to change the way people think and act."
" The message of the MeToo movement should be something like “Give all women the benefit of the doubt, don’t dismiss them, and investigate their claims” rather than “Believe all women”","i have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the ford kavanaugh situation. if that is the case, i think kavanaugh will likely be voted in. this would cause an outrage because so many people reasonably do not like the idea of appointing people accused of attempted rape to the supreme court. i feel that upholding our tradition of due process is more important than any one unsubstantiated sexual assault allegation no matter how credible the woman seems. i believe she is supremely credible with regard to the claim that something happened to her. however, so far that credibility hasn t been able to be transformed into any sort of verifiability. we shouldn t believe every allegation simply in virtue of its existence. if it is positively shown to be true, action should be taken. if it is positively chosen to be false, the allegation should be dismissed. and if it can t be positively shown to be either, which may very well be the case here, i don t view it as a failure of morality to move forward as if the allegation was shown to be false. there is nothing sexist about the burden of proof being on the accuser. it is possible to show deep sympathy for an accuser and give her the time of day while simultaneously reaching the conclusion that unfortunately her claims couldn t be substantiated so no action will be taken. it is better to let guilty people go free than to punish the innocent. because i believe this, believe all women doesn t seem measured or nuanced enough for me. accusers deserve to be taken seriously and the accused deserve due process! not as catchy i know. i feel like this is a pretty rational, measured take, but it s one i don t really see represented in media."," The message of the MeToo movement should be something like “Give all women the benefit of the doubt, don’t dismiss them, and investigate their claims” rather than “Believe all women” : i have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the ford kavanaugh situation. if that is the case, i think kavanaugh will likely be voted in. this would cause an outrage because so many people reasonably do not like the idea of appointing people accused of attempted rape to the supreme court. i feel that upholding our tradition of due process is more important than any one unsubstantiated sexual assault allegation no matter how credible the woman seems. i believe she is supremely credible with regard to the claim that something happened to her. however, so far that credibility hasn t been able to be transformed into any sort of verifiability. we shouldn t believe every allegation simply in virtue of its existence. if it is positively shown to be true, action should be taken. if it is positively chosen to be false, the allegation should be dismissed. and if it can t be positively shown to be either, which may very well be the case here, i don t view it as a failure of morality to move forward as if the allegation was shown to be false. there is nothing sexist about the burden of proof being on the accuser. it is possible to show deep sympathy for an accuser and give her the time of day while simultaneously reaching the conclusion that unfortunately her claims couldn t be substantiated so no action will be taken. it is better to let guilty people go free than to punish the innocent. because i believe this, believe all women doesn t seem measured or nuanced enough for me. accusers deserve to be taken seriously and the accused deserve due process! not as catchy i know. i feel like this is a pretty rational, measured take, but it s one i don t really see represented in media.",Kavanaugh should be confirmed based on the credible allegations made against him,"is that even the view of the metoo movement?

the first months of the bush presidency were taken up with the popping of the tech bubble. in retrospect it wasn't that big of a deal and certainly got over shadowed by other events, but at the time it was a big deal and demanded a huge amount of time dealing with the economic and social impacts. which means i don't think any reasonable president acting without advanced knowledge could have avoided 9 11. would you agree with me on that? now if you accept that 9 11 has happened, i am also going to propose to you that the invasion of afghanistan was also unavoidable. even if you had perfect knowledge of what would happen there, any president would have be compelled to invade afghanistan. lets then talk about iraq. post 9 11 the usa quickly realized that the status quo in the middle east was not acceptable to it. people chanting 'death to america' in the streets was going to eventually lead to attacks. philosophically it became clear that america couldn't simply wall itself off from the rest of the world but instead needed to get involved more directly. so we had a list of hot spots. russia, iran, iraq, north korea, saudi arabia, and 'palestine' that were the major issues. bush put a lot of diplomatic effort into russia and thought he had developed a good working relationship with putin. he read putin wrong. but someone had to. someone had to give putin the chance to play the good guy and let him make the active choice to instead play the bad guy. bush took the hit on that. but look at hrc at state and the reset button. they tried again, and failed again, so it isn't as though bush's actions here were unreasonable. if anything bush was ahead of the curve figuring out who putin was. north korea bush engaged in some pretty successful diplomacy and definately got the pot down to a simmer there. it was obama who allowed the heat to be reapplied. on the saudi arabia front the kingdom basically got on a path towards reform and has been making little steps along it ever since and while its still a shit show and a lot of crgoes to obama for continuing the good work and building on it , its better than iran or iraq so that's some kind of win right? so bush was left with iraq and iran. historic enemies of each other, both enemies of america, and both actively funding terrorists and interesting in wmd's. iraq however was giving good cause for war. they were violating the terms of the first gulf war's end by frustrating the work of weapon's inspectors this was a deliberate policy of saddam so that other players in the region would think he had wmd's available to him . they were firing on us warplanes patroling the no fly zone on a regular basis this is independently a near weekly act of war against the united states . they were funding terrorism in israel and around the world openly paying the families of dead terrorists for successful attacks . and so they were invaded. the decision was put to congress, and virtually every democratic senator and congressman voted in favor of it. would clinton have done otherwise had he been in office? i doubt it. it was, to a certain extent, a war of choice. however post 9 11 saddam's course of conduct was no longer acceptable to america. clinton might have tried deeper negotiations or pushed for more sanctions, but that would have sent a weaker message to iran. furthermore there was good reason to think, at the time, iraq was going to be a relative cake walk. or at least much less of a mess than it turned into. so i don't know if you can really say that clinton wouldn't have done exactly what bush did there. the one thought i will leave you with. the sanctions applied on iraq didn't personally hurt saddam. he had his lifestyle and if ten thousand children a month had to starve to death so that he could throw a lavish party using the food that would have saved them he threw the party. hundreds of thousands of people were dying in iraq yearly due to the sanctions we imposed. imagine we were 15 years later and the sanctions were still in place. who's the mass murderer now?","i don't think it's a good idea to say that bush jr is a bad president, but it's not a bad thing to say. in fact, i think it would be better to say he is a good president than a bad one. i'm not sure what you mean by 'good president', but i think you're confusing 'good' with 'bad'. if you mean 'bad president', then i don't see why you would want to call him a bad person.","i think you're misinterpreting what bush was and what trump was not. i think the problem is that you're assuming that bush was a terrible person. i don't think this is true, but i think it's true that he was a good person, and that he's a bad person. however, i think that's not the same as saying that he wasn't a great person, or that he didn't do a good job at his job. the problem with your view is that it makes it seem like you're saying that trump is worse than bush, which is not the case. the truth is that we don't really know what bush did, and we can't know for certain what he did. but that doesn't mean that he isn't bad. there are a lot of bad things that he has done, and there are plenty of good things he hasn't done, but there are also bad things he's done that don't make him a good","i don't think we should change the law in the uk to make it easier to travel, but i do think it should be easier to do so in the us."

 Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication.,"my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable."," Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication. : my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable.",I believe that psychiatrists should not be allowed to diagnose children with mental illness.,"i think this decision should be left to doctors who study thousands of patients for years to determine what works and what doesn t. it should be left to their skilled opinions, not a layman s debate. doctor s wouldn t prescribe medicines that hurt unless the benefits outweighed the consequences.","i think it depends on what you mean by'mental illness.'i don't think this is the case, but i think it's important to understand that mental illness is a mental illness.","i'm going to try to change your view by saying that there is a difference between'mental illness' and 'psychiatric medication.'mental illness is a mental illness that is caused by the state of the brain. it is not a disease, it is a disorder.","i'm not sure what you mean by'mental illness'. i don't think it's a mental illness at all. i think mental illness is a mental disorder. i'm not going to try to change your view, but i'm going to challenge your view that psychiatrists should not be allowed to diagnose children with mental illness."

 Not everyone should be allowed to have children,"the three main bases of assessment would be: 1 financial economic, 2 psychologically, 3 criminal history. 1. economically financially: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to provide for the child's basic needs housing, food, reasonable estimate of healthcare etc. , and education at least through high school . this would be based on a holistic assessment of the person's and or couple's current income both active and passive , earning potential, availability of fairly liquid capital;

 I see no reason to get the flu shot,"first i am in good health and have a strong immune system. it has been years since i've suffered any notable illness. i am strongly in favor of most vaccines. one of my uncles died at a young age due to my grandparents on one side of the family being part of a well known deadly cult which shuns modern medicine. i have every standard vaccine given to someone born in the 1980s. the cdc states that the flu vaccine only reduces risk of influenza by 40 60 with notable reduction in effectiveness for certain types of flu. i have little to no contact with young children, the elderly, or those i know to have compromised immune systems. it is my belief that i should not pay money for the inconvenience of feeling unwell and being sore for a few days for a mildly reduced chance of an already unlikely event. it would likely make work miserable for me during that time and i am not willing to sacrifice my precious time off just to feel sick on purpose. i feel that the negatives severely outweigh the positives in this case. do you have any arguments to change my view?"," I see no reason to get the flu shot : first i am in good health and have a strong immune system. it has been years since i've suffered any notable illness. i am strongly in favor of most vaccines. one of my uncles died at a young age due to my grandparents on one side of the family being part of a well known deadly cult which shuns modern medicine. i have every standard vaccine given to someone born in the 1980s. the cdc states that the flu vaccine only reduces risk of influenza by 40 60 with notable reduction in effectiveness for certain types of flu. i have little to no contact with young children, the elderly, or those i know to have compromised immune systems. it is my belief that i should not pay money for the inconvenience of feeling unwell and being sore for a few days for a mildly reduced chance of an already unlikely event. it would likely make work miserable for me during that time and i am not willing to sacrifice my precious time off just to feel sick on purpose. i feel that the negatives severely outweigh the positives in this case. do you have any arguments to change my view?",i don't want to get the flu vaccine.,"please tell me if this makes no sense. i don't enjoy getting sick, and i do care enough about other people to not want to get them sick, however:i am neither young nor elderly mid 30's , and haven't had the flu in several years. i feel lucky for that, not naturally immune. i have convinced myself that it's okay, and possibly beneficial to get sick from time to time, because the body produces tumor necrosis factor when mounting an immune response. correct my logic if i'm way off, but maybe it's worthwhile if i get ill every so often if it means tumors are less apt to develop? and much as i enjoy life, i think it's okay if a bunch of humans die of natural causes. the world might be a better place for those who survive. amp; x200b;","if you get sick, you can't get a vaccine. if you don't get the vaccine, then you won't be able to get it.","the flu shot isn't going to kill you, it's going to prevent you from getting sick. if you don't want to get the flu, you should get it.","if you don't want to get the flu, don't get it."
 I think the Internet could eventually replace universities,"universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university? can disciplinary knowledge also become social knowledge that is freely accessed, produced and disseminated by literally anyone that might choose to participate? for this to be possible, i think we would need to see a couple big changes take place. first and foremost, we would need a sort of second wave enlightenment which would throw out the current paradigm of alternative facts and insulated echo chambers of information. society as a whole would need to accept a common sense of objectivity and rationality, such that it is able to uphold its own standards of legitimacy. bad faith research and education would need to be quickly marginalized; but we would also need to be willing to accept innovation and new ideas, as long as they meet the standards of our collective scrutiny. secondly, we would need to see some sort of system of compensation that would fund research and education as goods in themselves . as it currently stands, this is the biggest issue in higher education and research. during his presidency, reagan criticized the disciplinary knowledge produced by university researchers, claiming that they were merely satisfying personal curiosity about obscure or useless issues, and using this criticism to justify a massive defunding of higher education. the legacy of this defunding has been the increase in student tuition and debt, an increased presence of private businesses on university campuses, a new focus on collegiate athletics and recreation to attract students, the co opting of research by private interests, etc. research and education have been re cast as means to capitalist ends; research to provide technological innovations to industry, education to equip laborers with knowledge and or general capabilities needed for workplace success. for the internet to become the new medium for research and education, we would need to somehow return to a social paradigm where knowledge itself is a valid end to pursue, and education is inherently enriching , and these goods are willingly funded by society without some expectation of an economic return. can we reach this point in our future? i would speculate that we can for a couple reasons. there will come a tipping point where the continuous expansion of higher education devalues the degree such that it is no longer economically feasible to pursue. secondly, while much of what we see happening on the internet is not encouraging, there are still some bright spots, and there is still the fact that the internet is very young. we have future generations that will grow up not even knowing a time before the internet existed; we can hope that these new immersed generations will make better use of the internet as a medium for research and education. we can hope that these younger generations will react against the uncertainty and relativism of our current generations, and bring about this second wave enlightenment that would need to take place. change my view."," I think the Internet could eventually replace universities : universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university?

" ""Fat Shaming"" shouldn't be treated as actual discrimination","so in recent years, there has been a greater concern from the general american public about how we treat those who are overweight or obese. many such as those in the fat acceptance movement and other such groups have began to argue that things like pointing out someone's weight, making fun of someone's weight, and certain portrayals of overweight people in media are all something called 'fat shaming.

" When fighting terrorists like ISIS, we should toss aside 'moral' warfare for effective warfare.","since 2011 or so, isis has been raising syria to the ground, the syrian civil war has only helped them maintain their control, but although they are losing ground now, several years after they had enstated their 'state', they still hold considerable territory, and still hold major population centres in many area's of the country. isis have clearly shown themselves to be savage, barbaric and lacking with any sense of human empathy, in area's where we have driven them away we have found nothing but piles of corpses and mass graves as a symbol of their atrocities. they have captured ethnic minorities, and slaughtered them with an unremorseful stature. they have captured our own men and women, and tortured them in the most gruesome ways, before usually executing them. there are many area's in syria where city sieges have been gruesome and pyrrhic at best. the cities we enter when isis have eventually been driven out leave the exact same situation that they begun at, instead this time, the people slowly died from starvation, disease and dehydration, which is a horrible way for anyone to die. in my opinion, if a town city is of no major importance to the nation, and would be better out of enemy hands than in theirs, would it not be more ethically considerable to initiate a tactical nuclear strike? after all, it would most likely kill everyone within the vicinity instantly, and its not like the cities are going to be reused after the war ends, in most other major cities recaptured in syria, the buildings are beyond repair due to months if not years of shelling, laser guiding bombings and heavy armaments fire, so the buildings are going to be demolished anyway. how can we claim to have the moral high ground when we shell cities and cause immense human suffering simply because we lack the 'morality' to end their lives quickly? the civilians in these cities will die a slow, painful and debilitating death because we carry out yearly sieges on cities, why not end their suffering quickly? a tactical nuclear strike against a city that is not important would kill all the isis insurgents, but also bring peace to any civilians, who would no longer have to suffer. i am not saying use nuclear weapons in all circumstances, i am saying if it is more efficient and will kill less people than a city siege, and more often than not, that will be the case. city seiges simply starve out the inhabitants, only for us to enter the population area's to find a funeral spire, that we ended up creating through out 'morality' tactics. in history, no major war has taken place with the premise of 'morality' being taken seriously, look at world war 1, gas was actively used, because it was effective. look at ww2, we bombed cities and factories, without consideration for the population than lived or worked there, because ultimately, it would stop the tide of an ideology that would ruin our way of life."," When fighting terrorists like ISIS, we should toss aside 'moral' warfare for effective warfare. : since 2011 or so, isis has been raising syria to the

stature. they have captured our own men and women, and tortured them in the most gruesome ways, before usually executing them. there are many area's in syria where city sieges have been gruesome and pyrrhic at best. the cities we enter when isis have eventually been driven out leave the exact same situation that they begun at, instead this time, the people slowly died from starvation, disease and dehydration, which is a horrible way for anyone to die. in my opinion, if a town city is of no major importance to the nation, and would be better out of enemy hands than in theirs, would it not be more ethically considerable to initiate a tactical nuclear strike? after all, it would most likely kill everyone within the vicinity instantly, and its not like the cities are going to be reused after the war ends, in most other major cities recaptured in syria, the buildings are beyond repair due to months if not years of shelling, laser guiding bombings and heavy armaments fire, so the buildings are going to be demolished anyway. how can we claim to have the moral high ground when we shell cities and cause immense human suffering simply because we lack the 'morality' to end their lives quickly? the civilians in these cities will die a slow, painful and debilitating death because we carry out yearly sieges on cities, why not end their suffering quickly? a tactical nuclear strike against a city that is not important would kill all the isis insurgents, but also bring peace to any civilians, who would no longer have to suffer. i am not saying use nuclear weapons in all circumstances, i am saying if it is more efficient and will kill less people than a city siege, and more often than not, that will be the case. city seiges simply starve out the inhabitants, only for us to enter the population area's to find a funeral spire, that we ended up creating through out 'morality' tactics. in history, no major war has taken place with the premise of 'morality' being taken seriously, look at world war 1, gas was actively used, because it was effective. look at ww2, we bombed cities and factories, without consideration for the population than lived or worked there, because ultimately, it would stop the tide of an ideology that would ruin our way of life.",i believe a tactical nuclear strike on a city would be more moral than the current war in syria.,"in the fight against a common enemy, you need to make sure that you yourself do not become what it is you intend to destroy. also, you have to understand the whys and what. why does this enemy exist, why are we fighting, and exactly what our goal is. mohammad mossadegh, president of iran during the early 50s, wished to nationalize the oil industry within iran. the company that is now known as british petroleum cried to the us and british governments of profits being impeded so the two governments teamed up to depose mohammad from power and install a puppet president, the shah, who would bow to the wills of the western world. the iranian people did not like that so in the late 70s, the citizens got together overthrowing the shah, taking over the us embassy there, and holding 66 americans hostage there over a year 444 days to be exact . thankfully, diplomacy ended the hostage situation amicably, but there is still a lot of anti american sentiment lingering in iran and they aren't wrong for holding it. 1990: saddam heussien, who were were allies with starting from the iran iraq war and ending in the above date, invaded kuwait. in response, president bush senior stationed troops on the border of saudi arabia and iraq on the saudi side which ticked off another one of our then current allies in the region, osama bin laden, the very same bin laden that led al qaeda until his death. a war on foreign soil can really only be won when you are not creating more enemies within its borders. among the reasons the vietnam war had to be declared a loss was because the viet cong was able to more easily recruit and replace its combatants that had been killed or captured. the growing disdain of the way at home didn't help any as well. by embracing the very same tactics they use against us, we are not proving ourselves to be the better man. rather we proving how shallow, careless, and greedy we are. if i were a citizen of the several countries the us is bombing, or one of its allies were bombing, i don't want the approaching squadron of helicopters to be what ends me, i want to be what ends them. you cannot expect to win a war by targeting civilians, you only give the civilians you didn't hit reason to take up arms against you. as much as it hurts to say this, the government of the united states deserved what happened on september 11th, and unless there is a major shift in foreign policy, preferably to one of non intervention, we are on a collision course for another terrorist attack of a similar scale. they don't hate us because of the freedoms afforded to us, they despise us because of what our government is doing to them. aside from south korea, i can't think of any country that has been made better off because the armed forces got involved in a conflict where they should've just stayed at home. tl:dr, when you embrace terrorist tactics, don't be surprised with disgruntled citizens employ the same tactics against you. sure, bombing isis territory with reckless abandon may end the threat that is isis for the time being, but what's stopping a civilian group from organizing a group that, in principle, is the exact same thing?","i don't think it's the moral high ground, but it's important to note that there are a lot of people who believe that a nuclear strike is more humane than a conventional strike. there are people who think that nuclear strikes are more humane, but that's not the case. there's also people who don't believe that nuclear weapons are the best option. they believe that they have the right to use them, and that they can use them to do so.","if you're going to make a moral decision, you have to make the decision based on what you think is right and what is wrong. if you want to be moral, you don't have to have a moral high ground, you just have to decide what is right or wrong.","i don't know if this will change your view, but i don't think it will change it's view. i think it's important to note that the us is not the only country in the world that has been invaded by isis. isis has been in the middle east for more than two decades now, and they're still fighting for their own people."

Athletes born as one gender and go through a transition to the other gender should not be able to compete as their 'new' gender,"first off i'm fairly new to this subreddit and reddit in general so i apologise if this discussion has already been and gone. although i certainly am not well educated on the whole topic, i recall reading articles about originally male athletes dominating their field when competing against women. i am sort of hoping i am being ignorant on the whole topic and that there is an easy solution already in place because it doesn't seem fair to the female athletes being beaten by originally male athletes may also be the reverse however i have not read anything on male athletes being beaten by originally female ones .","Athletes born as one gender and go through a transition to the other gender should not be able to compete as their 'new' gender : first off i'm fairly new to this subreddit and reddit in general so i apologise if this discussion has already been and gone. although i certainly am not well educated on the whole topic, i recall reading articles about originally male athletes dominating their field when competing against women. i am sort of hoping i am being ignorant on the whole topic and that there is an easy solution already in place because it doesn't seem fair to the female athletes being beaten by originally male athletes may also be the reverse however i have not read anything on male athletes being beaten by originally female ones .",i think female athletes should be allowed to compete against male athletes in sports.,"i posted on this topic before but unfortunately i cannot dig up my old post very easily. there was a relatively minimal study performed recently on trans athletes who competed in distance running, and after as little as one year of transition the majority of athletes in that competition had very similar age and gender adjusted performance; that is, an athlete who was a 93rd pecentile 37 year old male, two years of transitioning later, performed about as well as a 93rd percentile 39 year old woman. so at least in some cases it does appear that transitioning does not retain a gender advantage on performance. it may be different for different events e. g. maybe for lifting events performance normalization takes more time , but i don't think it's fair to just conclude that trans women will always outcompete cis women without looking into it. i assume you're not thinking about trans men with this discussion because forcing them to compete as women would be bad for everybody involved .","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i think it's important to note that this is a very complicated topic, and i don't think there's really a lot of evidence to back up your claim. first of all, i think you're missing the point of the argument, which is that women are not the only ones who are physically stronger than men. if you're going to argue that women aren't physically stronger, you need to take into account the fact that there's a huge amount of physical differences between men and women. it's not that men are stronger than women, it's that there are more physical differences that make it more difficult for women to compete in the same way men are. for example, if you were to say that women should be able to compete against men, you'd be right, but that's not the case. in fact, there's plenty of evidence that women can be physically stronger physically than men, and that's","i'm not sure what you mean by 'transgender'. i think it's important to recognize that trans people are different from cis people, and that they are different in different ways than cis people. for example, a trans woman may be able to run faster than a cis woman, but she can't run as fast as a cis man. this is true of all trans women, but it's also true of trans women. trans women can run faster faster than cis women. it's true that trans women are better at running than cis men, but that doesn't mean trans women aren't better at doing it.","the problem is that there is no way to change the rules of sports. there are rules that allow women to compete in sports, but there are also rules that prohibit men from competing in sports. if you want to change these rules, you need to go through the process of changing the rules. for example, let's say there is a rule that says that a woman cannot compete against a man in a sport, and that the woman should be allowed to compete against the man in the sport, but the man can't compete with the woman in the same sport."

 Dogs Are Better For Defending Your Home Than A Gun,"so, i'm a big fan of the second amendment, former military, experienced and trained in how to handle a firearm. i really enjoy the hobby of shooting, and spend a lot of time around like minded gun folks. because of this, i truly believe that many american's stated reason for owning a gun, home defense self defense, is absurd. a lot of my friends have described the 'self defense fantasy' wherein they heroically grab their gun and blow about the bad guys who break into their house in the middle of the night. i spent a year in iraq on qrf, sleeping with my rifle and a 30 round mag next to my head, and i know that i'm utterly useless for the first few minutes after i wake up. the idea that i could be awoken, armed, and thinking straight is already a lot to ask of me the guy with the military training . especially because adrenaline will almost certainly be flowing, and adrenaline makes you stupid, very stupid. don't believe me? try a shoot don't shoot course. see what you shoot. 2 laws for self defense typically don't let you go about shooting people, even in your own home. afaik the only state that lets you shoot somebody to defend your property is texas. it doesn't matter how much your tv is worth, in 49 states it's against the law to shoot somebody for taking it. furthermore, in many states, you have a duty to retreat, meaning that you must only use lethal force if you're cornered and have no other option. in other words, if you shoot somebody in your house, you might very well wind up on trial. 3 the chance of hitting the wrong person is non zero, and therefore needs to be considered. ricochets are weird, and once you pull that trigger there's a good chance the slug will wind up somewhere you hadn't thought of. especially when you're hopped up adrenaline and shooting in a dark room at night. 4 keeping a 'self defense ready' firearm ie accessible from your bedroom, with a round in the chamber or a mag within reach is a real hazard. i personally don't trust drunk me near a gun, because drunk me is an idiot. when i lived with my parents, i got the scare of my life when i found my 14 year old brother playing with my ak one day. it doesn't matter how secure your lock is, or how well you think you hid it, the people that live with you know how to get in there, and know where it is. 5 in many cases, calling 9 1 1 and barricading your door is going to do a better job of protecting you. the police officers who are awake, unlike you have legal authority to shoot, and will be be better equipped to deal with the bad guy. i realize this may not apply if you live in a super rural area where 9 1 1 could take 20 minutes to get a cop to you, but the overwhelming majority of americans don't live on a wilderness preserve in alaska. compare this to a dog. for the purposes of this cmv, i'm assuming a housebroken dog of at least a somewhat large breed, although not necessarily a mastiff or something huge. 1 your dog will absolutely hear somebody messing with your door in the middle of the night. your dog will also make it abundantly clear to that person that they've been detected, which may be enough to convince a would be home invader to try another house. they're ready to roll as soon as they spring awake, even if it's just going into a barking fit, during which time you can call 9 1 1. all of this happens without you having to go to the range on a regular basis to practice shooting. 2 laws about a dog biting somebody on your property vary wildly, but they generally don't treat it as harshly as shooting somebody on your property. this is also, of course, assuming your dog bites somebody, which they might not do, they might just go into a barking fit, which still served a valuable purpose. 3 in my experience, dogs know who should and shouldn't be in the house and react accordingly once they've identified you. even when i used to come home from the bar at 1am trying to sneak in so my wife doesn't yell at me, my dogs recognized me as soon as they're close enough to smell me. but not before they woke up the whole house to announce that a potential robber was coming in! this drastically reduces the chances of 'friendly fire' from a panicky person firing gunshots randomly in their house. 4 a well trained dog isn't a hazard. my pit bull boxer mix patiently watches my son try to chew on him. my shepard mix thinks that my son is his best friend and tries to comfort him when he starts crying. i can leave my son alone with my 2 dogs and know that when i come back i'll still have an intact heir and 2 dogs. if i left my kid alone with a gun, i'm not so sure. you can only defend your home while you're physically there. i'm writing specifically about the 'home break in overnight' scenario. i also feel that concealed carry for self defense is not as sound of an ideas as people think it is, but that's not in the scope of my argument above. i'm also writing for, say, 80 amp; 37; of households. obviously not everybody can have a dog either because their lifestyle, their allergies, or their landlord won't allow it. and an untrained dog is a hazard. i would never advocate getting a big scary breed and leaving in the backyard for its entire life. that serves no purpose, and imho creates its own hazard when this unsocialized asshole dog inevitably does get loose. what would change my view would be something that really refutes any of my above points, especially if you can show me statistics proving a gun is a more reliable for of defense than a dog. or if you can show me some legal precedent that a dog used for self defense is at least as legally precarious as shooting a gun at a home invader."," Dogs Are

enough to convince a would be home invader to try another house. they're ready to roll as soon as they spring awake, even if it's just going into a barking fit, during which time you can call 9 1 1. all of this happens without you having to go to the range on a regular basis to practice shooting. 2 laws about a dog biting somebody on your property vary wildly, but they generally don't treat it as harshly as shooting somebody on your property. this is also, of course, assuming your dog bites somebody, which they might not do, they might just go into a barking fit, which still served a valuable purpose. 3 in my experience, dogs know who should and shouldn't be in the house and react accordingly once they've identified you. even when i used to come home from the bar at 1am trying to sneak in so my wife doesn't yell at me, my dogs recognized me as soon as they're close enough to smell me. but not before they woke up the whole house to announce that a potential robber was coming in! this drastically reduces the chances of 'friendly fire' from a panicky person firing gunshots randomly in their house. 4 a well trained dog isn't a hazard. my pit bull boxer mix patiently watches my son try to chew on him. my shepard mix thinks that my son is his best friend and tries to comfort him when he starts crying. i can leave my son alone with my 2 dogs and know that when i come back i'll still have an intact heir and 2 dogs. if i left my kid alone with a gun, i'm not so sure. you can only defend your home while you're physically there. i'm writing specifically about the 'home break in overnight' scenario. i also feel that concealed carry for self defense is not as sound of an ideas as people think it is, but that's not in the scope of my argument above. i'm also writing for, say, 80 amp; 37; of households. obviously not everybody can have a dog either because their lifestyle, their allergies, or their landlord won't allow it. and an untrained dog is a hazard. i would never advocate getting a big scary breed and leaving in the backyard for its entire life. that serves no purpose, and imho creates its own hazard when this unsocialized asshole dog inevitably does get loose. what would change my view would be something that really refutes any of my above points, especially if you can show me statistics proving a gun is a more reliable for of defense than a dog. or if you can show me some legal precedent that a dog used for self defense is at least as legally precarious as shooting a gun at a home invader.",Owning a gun for self defense in the middle of the night is a terrible idea.,"not everyone can own take care of a dog allergies, cost, property restrictions on animals also guns are more so used as a deterrent to crime rather than an actual stopper of crime. a guy breaking into your house hears the sound of a shotgun being cocked will almost definitely dissuade them from continuing to try and victimize that individual. which neighborhood would a criminal be more likely to rob, the neighborhood that has strict gun laws preventing owners in that community from owning firearms or the one that doesn't? not to say dogs aren't a good home defense tool but i think the right to have both is important.","i'm going to take a shot at this from a different angle. i'm not a gun owner, but i do have a gun. i know a lot of people who don't own a gun, and i don't want to get into a fight with someone who doesn't have one. i've never been in a situation where i had to defend myself with a gun because i thought it was a good idea.","i'm going to take a stab at this from a different angle. i'm not a gun owner, but i do have a gun. i don't have a weapon. i have a pistol. i carry a shotgun. i do not have a rifle. i use a shotgun to defend myself. i am not going to shoot anyone. i will not shoot someone in the head. i won't shoot anyone in the face. i'll shoot people in the chest. i can't shoot them in the back of the head, or in the front of the face, or on the face of the ground, or at the top of the stairs, or anywhere close to the door, or anything like that. i would not shoot a person in the stomach, or any of the other things you mentioned. i also do not use a gun to defend my house. i only use a firearm to protect myself from people who are in my home. if i am in a situation where i","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i want to point out that self defense is not the only reason for owning a gun. there are a lot of other reasons to own a gun, too. one of them is that it is easier to get a gun in your home than it is to get one in your car. if you don't have a car, you will have to drive to the nearest town."

" The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part","the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation? answer: they know people will pay to see it. 3. i think all the changes they have typically made between the original and the modern remakes have been 100 for the worse from my standpoint but 100 for the safer from a marketing standpoint. e. g. instead of the beast from beauty and the beast being a beast , he s like a tall muscly guy with a hairy face. in the cartoon he was an actual monster, not unlike a bearwolf hybrid. but this was more palatable in the 3d animation medium to marketers."," The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part : the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation?

 People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion.,"i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to?

take germany. germany didn t even exist until 1871, and it was not at all obvious in advance how it would come together. what really united the prussians of koenigsburg with the swabians of w rttemberg? is schleswig german or danish? is alsace german or french? should the ethno state unite under prussian or austrian domination? what about the german speakers in suedtirol and sudetenland? or the volga germans? before ethnic nationalism, those questions weren t particularly important. with ethnic nationalism, it took multiple catastrophic wars to settle them. you mention foreigners going back to their homeland. but in many cases people were in their homelands, only for their homeland to become someone else s ethnostate. if the german ethnostate was going to use these ancient homelands to lay claim to territory von der maas bis an die memel and von der etsch bis an den belt, then the obvious solution was to expel everyone from those homelands. by the logic of the ethnostate, ethnic cleansing makes sense. the same story repeats itself for every ethnostate. france looks unified today, because they spent the last 200 years suppressing anyone who didn t fit the mold of french. the spanish attempt at an ethnostate inspired a violent ethnic revolt yugoslavia united itself under the banner of the southern slavs, until they remembered that croatians, serbians and bosniaks are completely different, even if their families had lived next door for hundreds of years. ethnostates look great if you re in the dominant group, but there really isn t any way to make one without a trail of atrocity and abuse along the way.","i don't think it's a good idea to have a culture that is a part of our culture, but it's not a bad thing to have it in the first place. let's say i'm a white man, and i want to be a white woman. i don't want to live in a country where i'm not allowed to speak my language. i want a culture where i can speak my own language, but i'm also allowed to have my own culture. if i am white, i will be able to speak their language, and that's fine. but if i'm black, i can't speak their culture. and i'm allowed to make my own food. i can choose to eat their food, and they can choose not to eat my food. and if they choose to, they can make their own food, so they can eat whatever they want. if they want to make their food more diverse, then they can do that. but what if they","i think that if you want to promote ethno states, you need to start with the idea that they are bad for everyone. for example, let's say you want germany to remain 'german' in all of its forms just as much as you want japan, india, israel, niger, nepal or sweden too. you don't see the harm of that, but you do see the harms of substituting and diluting already existing iconic cultures and acting like nothing happened.",i don't see anything wrong with multiculturalism. i see nothing wrong with the idea that multiculturalism is good for everyone. i don't think it's good for the world. i think it is bad for the country.

like let's talk about the bump stock thing. you say that banning the bump stock used in the vegas shooting won't stop people from being able to achieve the effect. the only way your viewpoint here could be relevant would be if this fact, the fact that banning the vegas bump stock is impossible, would cause gun control advocates to abandon the cause entirely. right? you think they ought to acknowledge that you can't ban a bump stock, so don't even bother trying. right? don't you see how that's kind of a simple minded and uncreative response to the issue? you could legislate a redesign of guns so that belt loops can't achieve the same effect. you could at least acknowledge that it's far more difficult to achieve the same effect with more macgyver like bump stocks, so it's a net win. human ingenuity is vast and the solutions here are numerous, yet most gun rights activists don't even want to try. i just don't understand what factoid about guns could ever inspire someone who wants them to be controlled to instead abandon the whole idea of gun control and become a full fledged gun enthusiast. that's why i don't think this viewpoint has any relevance. it's identical to abortion. if you're against abortion, you likely don't know the exact medical procedure on how it works. all you know is that you hate that it happens and you want it to stop. and any progress towards that goal, whether it's a mandatory waiting period, forcing mothers to tell their parents, shutting down a clinic here and there, etc. is hailed as a success. they didn't stop abortions, but they reduced them, and any progress towards 0 abortions is, in their minds, a win. and it's worth fighting for. why is gun control any different?","i'm not sure what you're talking about, but i'd like to point out that there are a lot of gun control advocates in the us that don't understand how guns work. they don't know how to use a gun, but they do know how it works. i'm not going to try to convince you that gun control is better than gun control, but if you're going to argue that it's better, then you have to ask yourself why it's worse than it used to be.","i don't know about guns, but i do know that the vast majority of people who advocate for gun control have zero idea what they're talking about. for example, i don't think it's fair to say that there are people who are pro gun control because they have no idea what guns are.","i don't think anyone is going to change your view. i think it's important to remember that gun control is not about banning guns, it's about preventing people from having guns. banning bump stocks will stop people from being able to bumpfire because it's black. banning pants will prevent people from getting the exact same effect using a belt loop on your pants, good luck banning pants. it's not that banning pants won't reduce the number of shootings, it just won't stop them from having access to guns."

your food will cook this unevenly too, but not so with a good cast iron because it distributes the heat better. this heat retention also helps with cooking meat. want to brown a roast? you need high sustained heat for that. the problem with other pans is that as soon as the roast touches the pan, the roast cools the pan down to too low a temperature to brown it well, while the stove struggles to keep the temperature up. but with cast iron, get that sucker smoking hot and go for it. the same applies to steaks. steaks made on aluminum suck, but they can be great on cast iron. it also helps for frying because the heat retention helps keep the oil at a constant temperature. you dunk your fries in, the oil tries to cool down, the pan has heat immediately available on all sides to keep it hot, then the stove works to reheat the pan. now as to care and expectations. don't take a brand new cast iron and try to cook an egg in it. cast iron is seasoned using carbon deposits from oils, that's the 'gunk' on it that you want to keep, and it protects it from sticking and rust. after a time, and with proper care, this seasoning only gets better and better. eventually it will form a practically non stick surface that will have your eggs sliding right off. i have a jet black pan that little can stick to. in the early days stick to frying things that don't tend to stick. in the exact opposite of teflon, the pan will only get better with each use. as for cleaning? who needs soap and scrubbing like with stainless steel? who needs to worry about harming that delicate teflon surface? with a well seasoned pan i can usually just rinse it in the sink and wipe with a paper towel. if something stuck a little, a light rub with a steel scrubbing pad takes care of it. added bonus, it makes for a great self defense weapon in a pinch. more bonus, treated right, the pan will last longer than you, your kids, and your grandkids. and more, when heated to high temperature they don't give off poisonous vapors like non stick pans do. if you way overheat them say, left a dry pan on high and you walked away for a while , the worst that happens is your burn off your seasoning and kitchen is full of regular smoke. then you re season and start over. okay, one last thing. they are the best for cooking food that goes from stove to oven. the absolute best corn bread is made by melting butter in a cast iron skillet on medium heat, pouring the batter in, waiting for it to bubble a bit, and then putting it in the oven to bake. the crust is heavenly. the same applies for pineapple upside down cake. you're missing out if you're just making that in a baking pan. no, get all that butter and brown sugar sizzling, drop in your pineapples and cherries, dump in the batter, then put it in the oven. with a properly seasoned pan the cake will fall right out. i suggest watching some videos about cast iron seasoning. it makes more sense when you can see what a good pan looks like and what it can do.","i'm not sure if this has already been said, but i'll give it a shot. first of all, i don't think you're going to change your view by saying that they're gross and unsanitary. if you want to get rid of them, you need to do so by using a toothbrush. secondly, if you don't like the smell of burnt bits, you probably don't want to clean them. you're not going to be able to wash them off if you scrub them, so you're just going to have to use a tooth brush. thirdly, i'm not really sure what you're talking about here.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i will try to change your mind. first of all, cast iron cookware is cheap. it is cheap, easy to make, and has a good shelf life. second, it is very easy to clean. you can't just rub oils and salts into it. you have to rub oils, salts into them so they actually taste right. thirdly, you can rub oils into them. you don't need to rub salts, salts, or oils to get them off, just rub them on. fourthly, i don't see how you could argue that it is unsanitary to use a cast iron dishwasher.","i don't think you can get rid of the smell of cigarette butts, but i do think they can be a good way to clean your hands. there are a lot of things you can do with your hands, but that doesn't mean you can't use your fingers to clean them. if you don't want to use your hands to clean cigarettes, you can use them to clean yourself."
 Parents should not tell their kids it's OK to be a failure.,"ok, so i already know that i'm going to get a lot of heat for this, and the kind of heat, so let me plea my case. it is my belief that each success, failure, good and bad person thing we meet experience brings us a step closer to who we truly are. that said, when we fail, go through a bad breakup, fall out with a close friend, etc. , therein lies the opportunity for growth, learning, and strength after some unavoidable pain and grief. here's my problem with that: in telling their child that it is ok to fail, which in some instances is totally fair and ok, there still lies a huge number of people who use this unconditional love as a means to blockade their inner feelings of inadequacy and mediocrity. i believe the most deep feelings of inner strength comes from within; it comes during the times you're sitting in a room, all alone with the weight of the world on your shoulders, and it being so heavy that you cease to feel anything at all. however, after this seemingly deadlocked state, something snaps and a fire bursts from within, and we become so consumed with the flame kindled from our own pain and emptiness, that we obsessively work to build a new self, and that self becomes volumes more indestructible than that which is cultivated after an extensive coddling period with mom and dad where you set off again at the suit of your leisure. this is the difference between intermittent rehab and surviving then living, and i mean being truly alive. it's in essence, the grown up version of when a little kid falls down and immediately runs to their parent's pantleg to cry and hide their face. i guess one could call it tough love, but because of the collectivist culture in america, this is the norm, because we have 'american family values.

 Cardi B is super overrated and annoying,"the vmas were on monday and i just about had a breakdown because cardi b won instead of hayley kiyoko for best new artist. hayley kiyoko has worked really hard to get where she is. she s the first big lesbian artist and is a big inspiration to me as a bisexual. i feel like cardi b was just given everything she has. her music makes me wanna throw up and don t even get me started on her voice. she talks like she s never spoken a word of english when she grew up in new york an american state. i have a reddit friend who mastered english, spanish, and another language i can t remember. he speaks fluently too. cardi b can t conquer one freaking language. maybe she speaks spanish too idk. now i don t like rap all that much except for like 90 s rap but cardi b s music is just awful. like what has music come to. now rap seems like it s all about flexing. oh i fuck all the chicks and i make a lot of money like i seriously couldn t give a shit. i want meaningful music. i know this has gone off topic but like i just keep typing and i can t stop. cardi b shouldn t have already gotten awards you have to earn those. like for many artists it takes a couple years. you have to grow. cardi b just came into the spotlight and in a year bam she s automatically the next madonna . like no, she needs to make real music. even ariana grande who charts without even trying she still makes music that s sounds unique to each album. like yours truly had kind of a 50 s vibe to it for multiple songs. my everything was a tiny bit r amp;b and pop. dangerous woman had it s own sound. sweetner has gone more hip hop. she s constantly reinventing her sound and doing a hell of a job of it. now i understand that cardi b hasn t had the time to release four albums but it all sounds the same. now i don t hate all rap but i just don t understand when it became this mainstream. that being said i think that all artists should be able to make it big without being a pop artist. who s to say what everybody likes. i don t know where this is going so i ll probably end it here. maybe i m just a bitch idk lol. also cardi b came out like last year or something hayley kiyoko released her first album this april. hayley kiyoko deserves so much love and fame. she sounds unique and writes her music from the heart. she helped me realize my true sexuality after repressing the thoughts over and over again because it was a sin . she taught me it was okay to be gay or bisexual in my case. okay imma go bye."," Cardi B is super overrated and annoying : the vmas

 The addition of required books in school curriculums are causing a decline of reading habits in younger generations.,"usually, the entire group, class, or grade level is assigned the same book. i see this trend in other high schools, especially with the same books such as fahrenheit 451, to kill a mockingbird, lord of the flies, etc."," The addition of required books in school curriculums are causing a decline of reading habits in younger generations. : usually, the entire group, class, or grade level is assigned the same book. i see this trend in other high schools, especially with the same books such as fahrenheit 451, to kill a mockingbird, lord of the flies, etc.",I think books should be assigned based on a student's performance in a class.,"the books assigned to be read are because they have an important lesson to teach the children reading them. whether it be about an adolescent coming to age, the history of racism, fascists dystopias, all of these are important for high school students learn and understand. it teaches the historical context and progression of literature. also every high school literature class i had, allowed us to read whatever we wanted and we usually had one paper over a book of our choosing. more so, what about the kids who flat out hate reading? if theyre forced to read those 3 books then that is 3 more books than they would have read.","i don't think it's fair to assign books based on the content of the book. for example, in high school, there was a lot of literature that was not written by the students, and the students didn't read it in class, so they didn't have to read it at all. i think there were other books that were written by students, but i think it would be unfair to assign them based on their content.","i agree with you, but i don't think you can argue that there is a decline of reading habits in younger generations. i think there are a lot of reasons for this, and i'm not sure what you are trying to argue here. firstly, i think that the lack of books in high school is a symptom of a decline in reading habits. there are plenty of books out there that are good for reading, and there are lots of books that are bad for reading. however, there are also plenty of things that are great for reading that aren't good for writing. for example, i'm going to try to find a book that i think will be good for learning. i also think that there are some good books that will be great for learning in the future. for instance, i have a friend who has been reading for a long time, and he has a great interest in reading. he loves to read, but he can't read all the books he wants","i think the problem with this is that it's not really an issue of class performance, it's a problem of what students think is best for the group. for example, i think it's important to have a group of students who are good at math, science, history, etc. that they know what they're doing well in the class, and that they can do well in a class. i think this is a problem with assigning books based on a group's performance, and not just a group performance. i don't think it would be a problem if a group was good at maths and science, but a group would be better at math and science if they were good at science and science."
" Leftist and social justice rhetoric need not concern itself with ""being nice""","one of the bigger criticisms i hear about sjws or liberals is that the way they present their ideas are not palatable to gain more widespread support. i am going to point out why this is a faulty argument and why 'being nice' makes absolutely no difference in how these ideas are going to be perceived. it removes agency from the right this is probably the aspect of this that annoys me the most. when trump got elected, there were even liberals that were saying stuff like, 'this is what happens when you call white people racist.

' this, however, is self contradictory because predjudice for racial reasons is the definition of racism. i don't know what can change my view on this, but i am looking forward to hearing your counter arguments!",I believe that only white people can be racist.,"first, let us start with a pretty simple definition of racism: racism: treating a race as inferior to everyone else or believing your race is superior to all other races you can go check the dictionary, but they all basically boil down to this definition ' superiority' now, the whole superiority thing is important. if you think a race is 'different', but you don't think that the difference makes them better worse, then you aren't really racist. it may be a lot of other things, but it isn't automatically racist. example: i think that asians have crustier ear wax than other races this isn't racist reverse racism 'reverse racism' is really not describing traditional racism. when people are being 'reverse racist' against white people, they aren't assuming white people are dumber more violent etc. they are simply directing malice towards them based on their race. 'disliking someone because of their race' is not racism. it is bigotry. however, people don't really like using that word 'bigoted' for some reason. it is the technically correct word, but people won't use it. why do people use the term. people can absolutely be racist against white people. i know some chinese people who are racist as fuck about white people. however, this isn't what anyone is talking about when they discuss 'reverse racism'. 'reverse racism' is a buzzword to describe anti white bigotry and sentiment which exists in minority communities, frequently because of perceived racism from the white people against the minorities. many white people feel that the backlash against white people has become too severe and now this 'reverse racism' bigotry threatens to over correct and cause even more racial animosity than existed when white people were originally being super racist. it is just a word that tries to sum up a lot of political sentiment at once and wrap it in a neat little package. lots of terms like this one homophobe describes anti gay people and attempts to accuse them of secretly fearing gay people fake news a borrowed term, which was originally used to describe actual false journalism, but is now used to insult tainted or biased journalism or the appearance of bias these terms are used to quickly allow people of similar persuasions to connect and recognize one another and share the sentiment without having to share a long winded conversation. they are literally 'memes'. they are almost never as simple as you are trying to make them. if you appreciate the context and historical background of the ideas being expressed by the speakers, you will realize why they are used and why people argue against them.","i think you are missing the crux of the issue. racism is a social construct. it is defined in a way that is racist. for example, if a black person is racist, they are not racist. but if a white person is prejudiced against black people, then it is not racist to say that they are racist. if you define racism in terms of race, then you are not saying that it is inherently racist. you are saying that there is no such thing as a 'race based' system. this is not true. the definition of racism is that there are two groups of people who are different. one group of people can be racist, and the other group can be prejudiced. the former group is more likely to be racist than the latter group.",i don't think anyone can be racist. i think it's possible to be prejudiced against white people but not racist against black people.,"i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to realize that racism isn't just a matter of race, it's also about culture. it's a social construct. if you don't want to be racist, you shouldn't be racist."

" Most cyclists on the road are incredibly inconsiderate and rude, and we should enforce them not getting in the way far more than we do.","maybe it's just where i live. but every morning evening when i drive to from work, there are packs of cyclists riding around. i think cycling is great. however my issue is often the attitude of these cyclists. they are less visible. it will be dark and many of them do not wear anything to stick out properly. they often travel in packs. packs that, instead of riding single file along the side of the road, clump together blocking huge portions of the road. i see no reason why this is necessary. the result is they cause traffic jams and instill fear in drivers like me."," Most cyclists on the road are incredibly inconsiderate and rude, and we should enforce them not getting in the way far more than we do. : maybe it's just where i live. but every morning evening when i drive to from work, there are packs of cyclists riding around. i think cycling is great. however my issue is often the attitude of these cyclists. they are less visible. it will be dark and many of them do not wear anything to stick out properly. they often travel in packs. packs that, instead of riding single file along the side of the road, clump together blocking huge portions of the road. i see no reason why this is necessary. the result is they cause traffic jams and instill fear in drivers like me.",I believe that cyclists cause more problems than they solve.,"cyclists are encouraged to cycle in the middle of the lane rather than against the curb for two main reasons. a the edge of the road contains most debris and drains which can be lethal hazards to cyclistsb you ve already alluded to trying to squeeze past cyclists within your own lane . this is dangerous and irresponsible and is the very reason cyclists block you from doing it. on your point about packs, they re far easier to overtake assuming they are in one lane than a long string of cyclists, simply by waiting for a space on the other side of the road. the only way to overtake a long string of cyclists is by dangerously squeezing past them as per b . treat it as a tractor. it s slow, it s an annoyance, but is has as much right to be there as you. only overtake when it is actually safe to do so. if you know that cyclists are prevalent on your route then leave an extra 2 mins early to account for the minimal delay you experience.","i agree with you, but i don't think it's fair to say that the majority of cyclists on the road are bad drivers. i live in a rural area, and there are a lot of cyclists who ride in packs, and i think that's a good thing. however, there are many people who ride on the side of the road, and they don't always have the same attitude as the rest of us. for example, if i'm on a busy road, i'm going to have to deal with a group of people who are riding in packs. there are plenty of people that don't have the attitude to get out of the way, but that doesn't mean that they aren't good drivers. it just means that there are more people who don't want to be in the car, and that they are less likely to get into the car. in the same way, it's not fair to assume that people who drive in packs are better drivers than people who","i'm going to try to change your view a little bit. i live in a city where there are a lot of bike lanes and there are lots of bike paths. there are also bike paths, bike paths and bike paths that are designed for cyclists. if you don't want to ride in the middle of the road, you shouldn't be riding in the right lane.",i don't think the problem is that they cause more problems than they solve. i think the issue is that there are more people riding on the road than there are cars.
 Artificial intelligence can't become conscious.,"i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there? ultimately, a computer is little more than a memory store and a processor. programs are stored in memory and their instructions are fed one by one into the processor. the instructions themselves are incredibly simple load and store numbers in memory, add or subtract these numbers, jump to a different instruction based on the result that's actually about all you need. all other instructions implemented by modern processors could be written in terms of these. computer memory doesn't have to be implemented via electrical transistors. you can use dots on a sheet of paper or a bunch of rocks sitting in a vast desert. likewise, the execution of program instructions doesn't have to be automated a mathematician could calculate by hand each instruction individually and write out the result on a piece of paper. it shouldn't make a difference as far as the software is concerned. what if our mathematician, hand computing the code to our ai, wrote out all of his work a complete trace of the program's execution? let's say he never erased anything. for each instruction in the program, he'd simply write out the instruction, its result, the address of the next instruction, and the addresses values of all updates to memory or, alternatively, a copy of all memory allocated by the program that includes these updates . after running the program to completion, what if our mathematician did it all again a second time? the same program, the same initial memory values. would a consciousness be created a second time, albeit having exactly the same experiences? a negative answer to this question would be very bizarre. how could the universe possibly remember that this particular program was already run once before and thereby force all subsequent executions to not develop consciousness? what if a layman came by and copied down the mathematician's written work, but without understanding it. why should it matter whether he understands what he's writing? arguably even the mathematician didn't understand the whole program, only each instruction in isolation. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, when written down, would automatically develop consciousness? what if our mathematician did not actually write out the steps of this second execution. what if he just read off all of his work from the first run and verified mentally that each instruction was processed correctly. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, if even just read , would automatically develop consciousness? why should the universe care whether or not someone is actively reading these symbols? why should the number of times the program develops consciousness depend on the number of people who simply read it? to change my view, you could explain to me how a program running on a modern future turing equivalent computer could develop consciousness, but would not if run on a computationally equivalent but mechanically simpler machine. alternatively, you could make the argument that my absurd consequences don't actually follow from my premises that there's a fundamental difference between what our mathematician does and what happens in an electronic fluidic mechanical computer. you could also argue that the human brain might actually be a hypercomputer and that hyper computation is a realistic direction for ai research, thereby invalidating my argument which depends on turing equivalence. what won't change my view, however, are arguments along the lines of 'since humans are conscious, therefore it must be possible to create a consciousness by simulating a human brain'. such a thing would mean that my absurd conclusions have to be true, and it seems disingenuous to hold an absurd view simply because it's the least absurd of all others that i currently know of."," Artificial intelligence can't become conscious. : i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there?

 I'm on course to vote no to the upcoming abortion referendum.,while i've been pro choice most of my life that's begun to change. what brought this on was the online discussion surrounding people with down syndrome and the news that most mothers who are made aware of their unborn having ds opting to abort. while i find this very sad ultimately it's very difficult to raise a child with ds and i can't force that responsibility on a family. what i can't justify to myself however is how this screening technology will be developed to apply to gay people in the future. there are physiological differences between straight and gay people and this is a subject of research. in the event a test is developed that detects gayness in foetuses with reasonable accuracy i realise this will lead to gay babies being aborted and that's what i find objectionable. it may sound silly but medical technology is always improving by leaps and bounds and when the technology of tomorrow meets the laws of today i fear it will lead to a portion of the gay community disappearing and i don't want that. i suppose the core view i want changed if a woman's choice to abort is always moral even if the reason is homophobia or some bigotry like that. i think if you're aborting a foetus because of a benign trait it will manifest in the future you are no longer treating it as a foetus but as a person it will become and it's my belief gay rights override the right to choice in this circumstance. in other words i have a gut feeling that voting to repeal will mean condemning future gay men and women to pre emptive deaths. i'd like to be convinced i'm wrong. thanks for taking the time to read and i'll be here a few hours., I'm on course to vote no to the upcoming abortion referendum. : while i've been pro choice most of my life that's begun to change. what brought this on was the online discussion surrounding people with down syndrome and the news that most mothers who are made aware of their unborn having ds opting to abort. while i find this very sad ultimately it's very difficult to raise a child with ds and i can't force that responsibility on a family. what i can't justify to myself however is how this screening technology will be developed to apply to gay people in the future. there are physiological differences between straight and gay people and this is a subject of research. in the event a test is developed that detects gayness in foetuses with reasonable accuracy i realise this will lead to gay babies being aborted and that's what i find objectionable. it may sound silly but medical technology is always improving by leaps and bounds and when the technology of tomorrow meets the laws of today i fear it will lead to a portion of the gay community disappearing and i don't want that. i suppose the core view i want changed if a woman's choice to abort is always moral even if the reason is homophobia or some bigotry like that. i think if you're aborting a foetus because of a benign trait it will manifest in the future you are no longer treating it as a foetus but as a person it will become and it's my belief gay rights override the right to choice in this circumstance. in other words i have a gut feeling that voting to repeal will mean condemning future gay men and women to pre emptive deaths. i'd like to be convinced i'm wrong. thanks for taking the time to read and i'll be here a few hours.,i'm pro choice but i don't think it's moral to abort a foetus because of a genetic abnormality,"you want to force women to bear unwanted children now , force the responsibility of raising children with down syndrome now , risk their health and financial stability now because of something that might happen at some point in the future?

 It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged,"i am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. english is not my native language so i will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. for the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million usd. any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. in fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. now, i am not saying hand out the poor free money. that makes people dependant. rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. what benefits society is considered the most important. reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. the virtues of simple living are prized highly as well."," It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged : i am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. english is not my native language so i will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. for the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million usd. any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. in fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. now, i am not saying hand out the poor free money. that makes people dependant. rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. what benefits society is considered the most important. reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. the virtues of simple living are prized highly as well.",i believe that we should not spend any money on the poor.,"is it fair to say that you see the suffering of poor people as far and away the best use of money? assuming that's true, might i be able to do more good for them with more money than just donating it? an example might help here. lest say i have 1 that i can donate. the best i can probably do with that is to give it to some poor person so they can afford some food or a bottle if clean water or whatever. but if i have 100, can i find a way to do more than 100x the good? like, maybe by building a water pump to get clean water. that pump would provide more than 100 worth of food for those people over its lifetime. but what if we scale it further? maybe if i had 100million that i could spend, i could finance the building of a factory that makes the water pumps in their country. so i'm providing jobs for people while still indirectly helping them get clean water. if i'm improving the entire country, i'm probably doing proportionally more good than just giving a million pumps. if you follow this line of logic, then it makes sense to make as much money as i can, and simply donate most of it when i die. this is because it's a lot easier to make a lot of money if you already have a lot of money, so if i'm keeping myself at your 50 mil cap, i'm limiting the net amount of good that i'll be able to do in my lifetime.","i think you're missing the point of capitalism. capitalism is a way to make sure that everyone has access to the same resources as everyone else. if you want to give everyone the same amount of money, then you have to give people the same level of access to resources as everybody else. in other words, if everyone has the same basic needs, then everyone should have the same opportunities.","i think you are missing the point. it is immoral to accumulate and spend more than you can consume, but it is not immoral to give it away.","the problem with your view is that you are assuming that the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. in fact, i would argue that the vast majority of people who are in poverty do not have the right to that ridiculous amount of money."

 There are probably inherent differences due to race,"firstly, i am not a racist. i do not see any one race as superior to another, nor do i think that we have enough information to truly categorize races by certain skills in specific areas. partially? absolutely. but to say that the singular cause of all of these differences in different races' iq, crime rates, and general behavior the fact that almost every top media industry is controlled by jewish individuals is a little odd to call just coincidence is purely cultural is absurd. i think people see a false dichotomy when it comes to this either i believe every race is the same, or i believe one race is best. that being said, i don't remember the statistics i've seen very well, nor do i know the validity of them. go ahead, reddit. change my view."," There are probably inherent differences due to race : firstly, i am not a racist. i do not see any one race as superior to another, nor do i think that we have enough information to truly categorize races by certain skills in specific areas. partially? absolutely. but to say that the singular cause of all of these differences in different races' iq, crime rates, and general behavior the fact that almost every top media industry is controlled by jewish individuals is a little odd to call just coincidence is purely cultural is absurd. i think people see a false dichotomy when it comes to this either i believe every race is the same, or i believe one race is best. that being said, i don't remember the statistics i've seen very well, nor do i know the validity of them. go ahead, reddit. change my view.","i believe that the differences in crime rates, wealth, etc. between races are due to cultural, not biological.","the exceptional intellectual performance of jewish people in my opinion has to do with the exceptional focus on education since centuries. the theological and philosopical sophistry there sometimes touches absurdity but still seems to be a perfect training for the brain. certainly epigenetics play a role in here. for me this is the best example that mankind could improve by focusing on top level education, not only for the elite but on every level of intellectual ability. and i think this is necessary for mankind to survive as a civilized species.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'false dichotomy.'i think you're conflating two different things. the first is that there is no singular cause for all of these differences in crime rates, crime rates and general behavior. the second is that we don't know exactly what causes these differences. i'm not going to try to change your view, but i'm going to attempt to change what you're saying. you seem to be saying that you don't believe that jewish people are the same as white people, but that is not the case. i think that you're misunderstanding the difference between jewish and white people. the difference is that white people are more likely to commit crimes, while black people are less likely to be violent. this is not a false dichotomy, it's just the fact that there are differences between people of different races.","i think you're missing the point of your argument. you're basically saying that there are probably inherent differences due to race, but you're ignoring the fact that there's no inherent difference between race and ethnicity.","i'm not sure if you're familiar with this topic, but i think it's important to note that race is not just a biological thing. there are a lot of factors that play a role in crime rates, wealth, etc. in the us, we don't have statistics about crime rates. we have statistics for crime rates and wealth, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other factors. for example, iq is very high in the united states, but in the uk it's much higher in the middle east, and it's also much lower in europe. there's also a huge difference between black and white iq, but it's not because of race. it's because of the fact that black people are more likely to commit crime than white people. so, it's more likely that the differences in iq are due to cultural factors, rather than biological ones."

 We can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of AR-15-pattern rifles,"i'm pro 2a, and am licensed for concealed carry in several states. here's why: the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation , and quick amp; easy reloading. for sure, there are other competing semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal, but the proof is in the pudding: ar 15 popularity is through the roof compared to those. the mini 14 suffers from awkward slow reloads, and an odd method of inserting a magazine. just that alone is good reason to consider restricting its availability. these shooters rationally chose the best, most inexpensive, most effective gun for taking down masses of people. i believe that the overwhelming majority of ar 15 owners aren't mass shooters. the problem is that their guns are often taken or stolen. i believe that there's a line acceptable to the 2nd amendment between what's acceptable for civilian use, and what is restricted for military use. tanks and bombs are on one side of that. i believe that ar 15's should be on that same, off limits side. i also believe it's easily possible to draft a law to limit them. i saw that on a quora answer."," We can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of AR-15-pattern rifles : i'm pro 2a, and am licensed for concealed carry in several states. here's why: the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation , and quick amp; easy reloading. for sure, there are other competing semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal, but the proof is in the pudding: ar 15 popularity is through the roof compared to those. the mini 14 suffers from awkward slow reloads, and an odd method of inserting a magazine. just that alone is good reason to consider restricting its availability. these shooters rationally chose the best, most inexpensive, most effective gun for taking down masses of people. i believe that the overwhelming majority of ar 15 owners aren't mass shooters. the problem is that their guns are often taken or stolen. i believe that there's a line acceptable to the 2nd amendment between what's acceptable for civilian use, and what is restricted for military use. tanks and bombs are on one side of that. i believe that ar 15's should be on that same, off limits side. i also believe it's easily possible to draft a law to limit them. i saw that on a quora answer.",i think the ar-15 should be restricted to military use.,"less than 1 of all ar 15s will be used to shoot up a school made up guess, but it's probably true i know there's a pattern, but millions of ar 15s are used entirely legally. you said something about guns being stolen, but that really doesn't happen that often iirc. if it does, just make gun safes mandatoryalso, the civilian ar 15 has never been used in the military. ever.","the ar 15 is a semi auto rifle. i'm not going to argue that it's the best light rifle ever designed, but i'm going to challenge your premise that it is the best weapon ever designed.","i'm not sure if this is a good or bad idea, but i think it's a good idea to ban civilian purchase of ar 15s. if you're going to ban them, you have to make sure that they are not used in a mass shooting. that way, you don't have to ban people from owning them. i'm not going to try to change your view, but if you want to change it, you need to start with the premise that the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed.","the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed, incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation and quick amp; easy reloadingi think that's a good reason to consider restricting it to military use. the ar 15 has a lot of advantages over other semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal. the fact that it's so easy to reload and quick to reload is not a reason to restrict it to civilian use. it's a reason why you can't make a law to limit it to private use."

 Crimes involving breach of trust should have more severe legal repercussions than the similar ones without.,"to elucidate my view, i'll try to frame an illustration. consider two acts of theft being performed which constitute as a crime under legal purview. case a: a man is walking down a lonely street late at night. suddenly, a mugger appears out of nowhere and robs him at gunpoint. case b: a man is walking down a busy street. a stranger walks to him seeking for help, describing a life and death situation. on humanitarian grounds, the man follows the stranger who leads him to not so happening street only to realize that it's all a setup. he is then robbed after being held at gun point. now, it is reasonable to state that the ultimate outcome in both of the cases was the man ended up being robbed. however when considered on a profound level, the varying experiences have resulted in different psychological impacts on that person. in case a, it is streetwise to avoid a deserted road to prevent from being taken advantage of. hence, the man would have estimated the probability of getting mugged and made a conscious decision. this would then conform to his existing prejudice about travelling isolated roads at night, which he would definitely avoid in the near future. however an experience from case b would have definitely scarred him by affecting his school of thought towards humanity. it would drive him to a conclusion that it is better off to avoid helping a human or anybody for that matter to avoid the risk of a false case. the next time he sees someone asking for help, even though his conscience would provoke him to provide assistance, his previous experience would say otherwise, thus deterring him from bestowing a respectable act of humanity. on an individual level it would not make a big difference, but consider the impact it would have if hundreds of individuals were robbed in a similar manner. it would then go on to be a preconceived notion that helping somebody en route to an isolated location would have disastrous implications. now imagine the plight of a person asking for help if his case was genuine. statistics suggest that majority of rape victims knew their perpetrators at least at a hierarchical level of an acquaintance. if this keeps on increasing individuals would be wary of accomplices, thus developing trust issues. events

 The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist.,"note that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed. at the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless. i am very aware i am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber. a few of my thoughts summed up: 1. ken: hey did you hear about janet? she isn t talking to you anymore because you didn t say hi to her last week dan: i figured. janet is always womanciding obviously both men and women are capable of being emotional, so why call it woman ciding? i m sure you can see my point here. 2. both men and women are capable of being condescending, but a man doing it to a woman needs a specific term for it? i think if you break it down the sexism lies in the assumption that a man who is condescending is just an asshole if it s towards a man and sexist if it is towards a woman. 3. why not just use he is condescending or she is condescending because both sexes are capable of being condescending. i feel like if you make a special word for one of them you are being obvious sexist. my whole point is if we say he yelled at her we should also be saying she yelled at her. just like we should be saying she was condescending and he was condescending instead of she was condescending to her vs he was mansplaining to her 4. you don t know if the man you are speaking to is being condescending simply because he is an asshole. this is in effect creating a double standard where the belief is women can freely explain things to men but men cannot freely explain to women under risk of appearing to be a sexist. i don t care for the societal institutional argument where the claim is that sexism hurt women in the workplace and society because men had more power in those roles. i did not do that. i took no part in that and don t know anyone that has. i m sorry if someone you know was hurt by that happening but i had nothing to do with it and if you can associate me with that kind of sexism because of my gender, then you are the sexist one. i am very open to other perspectives and would love to hear what you have to say :"," The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist. : note that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed. at the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless. i am very aware i am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber. a few of my thoughts summed up: 1. ken: hey did you hear about janet?

 Certain private companies like the social media/tech giants should be bound by similar free speech laws as the government.,"let me start off by saying i do not think we should tolerate intolerance, but at the same time i am against censorship. these laws exist for very valid reasons, and in some places have a few, also valid, exceptions, such as calling for violence against a person or group.

with billions of users. whether you agree with it or not, many people get their news from facebook. be it through news outlets posting articles on their pages, or groups sharing them, a very large number of people get their information about a plethora of topics from facebook. due to this fact, facebook has almost unprecedented power over what people can see. what can start off as extreme opinions that call for violence, ie something very clear cut and easy to determine, can slowly erode into something more grey and harder to define like 'no bigotry'. now i know this may seem like a slippery slope argument, but i am not saying it will necessarily turn into this, but simply highlighting that it is possible, and i don't think it should be. if facebook decided to update their policy to exclude things in a more vague way this could have far reaching impacts on the social sphere. there simply aren't any other platforms besides maybe twitter that can compete with facebook in terms of reaching a large audience. if you have an opinion or something you want to share, if you are barred from the widest used social media network, you are cut off from the largest way to share that idea. another perhaps more effective example would be if google skewed search results to favour a certain narrative. if searching something neutral like 'trump' in google brought up almost exclusively negative or positive articles, that would seriously impact how information was shared. google is perhaps the biggest example because they are not only a search engine, but the premier search engine

 Your vote in the US presidential election should not be informed by the candidate's likelihood of winning (specifically as it applies to 3rd party candidates or write-ins),"as an additional caveat, i should say that one of my biggest concerns in posting this is that i will simply encounter an echo chamber. my suspicion is that my views are likely held by most of reddit. but posting this is at least in part an attempt at catharsis: i've had these conversations in real life with so many people, and i inevitably run into what i perceive to be cognitive dissonance in the person i'm speaking with. there are at least a few nuances to the argument i'm putting forth that may strike at least somewhat of a nerve with the reddit community, so here goes. they strongly disliked trump, and justified their decision as 'voting for the lesser of two evils.

 humanity's ultimate goal should be to become a spacefaring civilization and we should invest more in it,"that's what we, and pretty much every other species, have evolved to do. there are many scenarios for humanity's extinction, most of them are based on the idea that we'll destroy earth ourselves, such as exploiting all of its resources, destroying its atmosphere or biosphere, global warming, etc. most of these scenarios can theoretically be avoided in the short term, but there's something which we can do absolutely nothing about. in a few billion years the sun will engulf earth and we'll have no other choice but to leave it, and that's assuming we'll survive long enough on earth for that to happen. so, my point is: either we leave earth or we face extinction, and if we want to eventually leave our planet we should start investing in space exploration right now since the future of our species depends on it."," humanity's ultimate goal should be to become a spacefaring civilization and we should invest more in it : that's what we, and pretty much every other species, have evolved to do. there are many scenarios for humanity's extinction, most of them are based on the idea that we'll destroy earth ourselves, such as exploiting all of its resources, destroying its atmosphere or biosphere, global warming, etc. most of these scenarios can theoretically be avoided in the short term, but there's something which we can do absolutely nothing about. in a few billion years the sun will engulf earth and we'll have no other choice but to leave it, and that's assuming we'll survive long enough on earth for that to happen. so, my point is: either we leave earth or we face extinction, and if we want to eventually leave our planet we should start investing in space exploration right now since the future of our species depends on it.","I believe that humanity has no choice but to leave this planet,","there's already billions of dollars allocated on organisations like nasa and spacex. the rest of the resources must go to somewhere else, there are other parts which not only are as important but affects what we do experience right now and of the future.","it's a question of what happens when we die, and what happens after we die. it's not a matter of whether we die or not, it's about what happens in the future, and if we don't die, what happens to the earth?","i think we should invest more in spacefaring civilization because we will eventually become extinct. we are already extinct, and there is no reason why we should not invest in space exploration. we have no reason to invest in it because we are not going to be able to colonize other planets in the future. if we are to become extinct, we will have to find other ways to survive. we will need to find a new way to survive, and that means we need to make sure that we are able to survive in other planets. we can't do that because we don't have the resources to do so. we also need to ensure that we have enough resources to survive on other planets, and we have the technology to do that.",i would argue that we have no choice but to leave the planet. the earth is the only place where we can survive. we are the only thing that can survive on this planet.
 Israel can not be both jewish and democratic,"being a democracy means that every part of the population gets to vote on the government that rules over them however in israel that is not the case, as not everyone can vote. while its true that last election the joint arab list party got the 3rd largest amount of votes, there are still milions of palestinian arabs that are denied this right. i argue that there is no reason why that should be a problem as far as i know almost no other democracy so openly discriminates based on religion in a hope to keep a certain ethnic group in the majority, despite the fact that they are not and thus are imposing minority rule of jews on the majority of the population which is arab. if israel wants to mend its reputation and actually become a real democracy its only option is to drop judaism. there are many other countries that are just democracies for all their citizens and dont have any religion directly connected to their government, and there is no reason for israel not to follow their lead. and a counter argument to jews need their own country : no they dont. no other religion apart from maybe islam and the vatican is so directly connected to the goverment of one specific country, and while it is possible for a country to have a majority of a specific religious group, there is no reason for the religion to be involved in government decisions."," Israel can not be both jewish and democratic : being a democracy means that every part of the population gets to vote on the government that rules over them however in israel that is not the case, as not everyone can vote. while its true that last election the joint arab list party got the 3rd largest amount of votes, there are still milions of palestinian arabs that are denied this right. i argue that there is no reason why that should be a problem as far as i know almost no other democracy so openly discriminates based on religion in a hope to keep a certain ethnic group in the majority, despite the fact that they are not and thus are imposing minority rule of jews on the majority of the population which is arab. if israel wants to mend its reputation and actually become a real democracy its only option is to drop judaism. there are many other countries that are just democracies for all their citizens and dont have any religion directly connected to their government, and there is no reason for israel not to follow their lead. and a counter argument to jews need their own country : no they dont. no other religion apart from maybe islam and the vatican is so directly connected to the goverment of one specific country, and while it is possible for a country to have a majority of a specific religious group, there is no reason for the religion to be involved in government decisions.",I believe that Israel should become a Jewish state.,"i mean, israel just needs to sign a peace treaty with the palestinians. presumably such a treaty will include independence for a large palestinian country. so yes it can be both, they just need to have an end to the war.","the problem with this is that it's not based on religion. it's based on the fact that israel is a secular country and has a secular government. the government has the right to dictate what happens in the country. israel's government is not a democracy, but it is a representative democracy. the people of israel are not allowed to have their own government, but they are allowed to vote on the laws that they want to enact. the problem is that there is no way for the government to be representative of the people. the only way the government can be representative is if the people want to be represented by the government. this is not the case in israel, it's the same in every other country.",i don't think that israel can be both jewish and democratic.,i'm not sure what you're talking about. israel is not a jewish state.
 You should be able to report disability fraud anonymously,"the reason the government wants you to provide your information is because the burden of proof is on the accuser. if the accusation is not true, the accuser can be charged with making a false accusation. the government also claims that the person you accuse will not be notified who reported them. on the reason explanation, the burden of proof should not be on the accuser. under the current system, you are not allowed to report suspicious activity. if an accuser's neighbor receives disability for a bad back, and sees him doing yard work and playing golf, the accuser can not know 100 that he is committed fraud. however, the accuser can make a judgment that something does not seem right, and the accuser would like the government to take a look. this is not unreasonable. from the s. s website gt; typically you would have to know someone quite well in order to determine whether or not he or she is taking advantage of the system. if you know someone as well as s. s wants you to, the accuser would need to practically live with the accused. the burden of proof is too high, and the punishments for false accusations are too strong. on the latter, i cannot see why or how this is true. it may not be the procedure to release the information to the accused, but if it goes to court, it has to be part of the discovery. there will be the information of the accuser in the government files, and if the accused fought hard enough he will get it. however, if the accused really cannot know who accused them, why demand the information at all. the benefits of staying anonymous is obvious. someone sees someone committing fraud, reports it to the proper authorities, and goes about their lives with 0 concern. my current situation is i work with someone who's husband collects disability for disease. he is a drug user, in a motorcycle gang, and works an under the table job that pays him good money. the wife i work with makes over 80k per year. but if i am wrong, what happens to me?

" My roommate, who is away for a month, should still pay all flat rate bills for that month","my bills are internet, gas, water, electric, and rent. i have two chief arguments for this. first, him being away does not affect these at all. if i were not living here too, then he would still have to pay all of these fees. by agreeing with these companies to have these services, he locked us into paying at least x per month in service fees. even if we decided that we no longer need water and stopped using it, we would still have to pay these fees for a year. therefore, him not using these services should have no bearing on whether or not he pays the service fees. this is assuming that we mutually agreed to these service, which we did. i would not use this argument if i had purchased cable tv that he did not want to begin with. second, these fees would have to be paid if i also left. for example, if i happened to plan a month long vacation at the same time, we would both be away and both not using these services. however, someone would have to pay the bills. by assuming his argument true, neither of us are responsible for the bills. yet, they must be paid by someone. therefore, using proof by contradiction, i must be correct."," My roommate, who is away for a month, should still pay all flat rate bills for that month : my bills are internet, gas, water, electric, and rent. i have two chief arguments for this. first, him being away does not affect these at all. if i were not living here too, then he would still have to pay all of these fees. by agreeing with these companies to have these services, he locked us into paying at least x per month in service fees. even if we decided that we no longer need water and stopped using it, we would still have to pay these fees for a year. therefore, him not using these services should have no bearing on whether or not he pays the service fees. this is assuming that we mutually agreed to these service, which we did. i would not use this argument if i had purchased cable tv that he did not want to begin with. second, these fees would have to be paid if i also left. for example, if i happened to plan a month long vacation at the same time, we would both be away and both not using these services. however, someone would have to pay the bills. by assuming his argument true, neither of us are responsible for the bills. yet, they must be paid by someone. therefore, using proof by contradiction, i must be correct.",i believe that my boyfriend is not responsible for paying all of my bills when i am not here.,he should pay half of the rent and internet because they have to be paid every month and it doesn't matter if they are used or not. the rest are dependent on usage. they do cost to be shut off and turned back on at least where i am and have a base rate. for that reason he should pay 25 or 33 of the other bills. start with 33 and agree to 25. ultimately it's better than finding a new house mate.,"i don't think you're wrong in that you're right in that there is no difference between the two. however, i think it's important to note that the only difference is that you don't have to pay the bills. if you're not paying the bills, you're paying the utilities. it's not a matter of whether or not you are paying them, it's about whether you're going to pay them.","i'm going to take a different approach to this. let's say you're renting a house for a month. your roommate doesn't use any of the utilities, so he has to pay the utilities. if he does, he doesn't have to pay for the house, and the house doesn't need to be paid for.","you are correct that your boyfriend is not responsible for paying all of your bills when you are not here. however, i think you are ignoring the fact that he is paying for these services when you aren't here. for example, if you were not living here too, then you would still have to pay all of these fees. if you are in a position where you can't afford to pay these fees, then it's not your responsibility to pay them."
 Male and female heterosexuality are different,"based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective? i mean after all male bisexuality was prominent in certain circles of greek and roman culture, but is on the fringe of our own culture."," Male and female heterosexuality are different : based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective?
