 The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions,"as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country."," The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions : as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country.",the republicans are just as bad as the tea party.,"the ultimate thing i can tell you is to always approach a subject with the conceptualization of perspective. you start off by assuming that the person you're talking to thinks your wrong, and unless your goal is to prove yourself right, the assumption that the person your talking to is either objectively wrong or unwilling to analyze demonstrable reality should be the option of last resort, and that is the point the conversation ends. imo, a conversation should aim to reach an elevated understanding of the truth for both parties even if one or both participants shift slightly then the conversation could be seen as at least productive. first and foremost, what is your criteria for changing your mind?",i think the problem with your view is that republicans don't seem to be interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations. they're interested in economic issues like health care and immigration. they aren't interested in immigration.,"i'm not sure if you're aware of this, but i think it's important to keep in mind that republicans are far more interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole.","the tea party is a far more extreme party than the republicans. if you're a non american but one interested in politics, you'll see that the tea party isn't as bad as the republican party."

 god existing would make sense,"the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from? and 2, if god exists why is there so much suffering in the world. well think of it this way, as far as we know, humans are the smartest beings in the universe. even though animals have proven to be intelligent, like dolphins and monkeys, we can t teach them human things. you can t teach a monkey how to write, read, or build a house. they re just not smart enough. my point is we are the monkeys and god is the human. what if god is so powerful that before creation, nothing existed, and he was the one who created time and perception. the 2nd problem is people think that god doesn t care because there are horrible things happening in the world everyday. but a lot of suffering comes from other people s decisions. decisions like murder, abuse, rape, and slavery come from free will. imagine if every time someone was about to sin god stopped them, god would be the helicopter parent that no one would want, this is why god gives free will, because even though everything would be peaceful, it would be slavery. humans have always preferred dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. the problem with many christians is that they take the bible literally. the bible is probably like 55 true because the old testament is older than written language so the only way to spread the information was through words. many hardcore christians are too focused on the details and forget that the morals and point of the stories are what s important. i also believe that some of the bible was corrupted and used to control people and make money, because when people are scared, they re easier to control. i honestly don t care if you re a christian or an atheist because it doesn t effect me at all. but if you can t come up with a reasonable argument to why god doesn t exist then i won t take you seriously. k, thanks for reading now change my mind."," god existing would make sense : the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from?

it means you can believe there is a god but there is no current way to prove it. your view is that it simply makes sense. in essence, you invoke occam's razor: the most likely explanation the correct. the problem with this, is that while a divine ruler is possible or at least not impossible it certainly is not the most likely, in comparison to other ideas. so what do we know? we know the organic components necessary to for life to form namely amino acids were present on archean earth some 3. 5 bya and that these components are themselves formed through inorganic processes. we know certain organisms can self organize and all organisms can replicate sexually or asexually, and that large structures such as galaxies form by rules set forth by the principles of physics to form and unravel. we know evolution can explain forms and behaviors and mechanisms of life of all kinds: from flight in birds and chemical communication in arthropods to immune systems and four chambered hearts. there are explanations for the vast majority of systems both biotic and abiotic on our earth. but then, you also mention intelligence and morality. you also mention the christian god as the god likely orchestrating our reality. let's examine these two. intelligence and morality are both very relative. we consider ourselves the most intelligent animals on earth, but we cannot organize as precisely as an ant colony. we can't echolocate our prey and we can't hunt by smell or hearing. these activities take intelligence, albeit a different kind. but let's isolate to human intelligence. chimpanzees and bonobos are in their stone age. they use the same tools our ancestors homo habilis did: rocks, sticks, grasses. given time, would they reach our 'level'? current studies suggest they could, just as we did. morality is a human construct to be sure, in that we give it a name. but all social animals have rules. wolf packs, lion prides, baboon troops and even flocks of geese follow social constraints to keep the peace in their ideal forms. isn't that what morality is? rules to keep the peace? additionally, if the christian god is the head honcho, why do all human civilizations have a set of moral and ethical rules, even if they were unexposed to the christian god in his entirety? the secular answer is that it makes evolutionary sense to preserve the species. i offer not proof that god is not real, but simply some evidence that it doesn't necessarily 'make the most sense'. that said, it leaves us to wonder who sparked the original organism? or spurred the big bang? i suppose short of god descending to our plane, it remains but an issue of faith. forgot a thing","i'm not sure if you can change your view, but i'm going to try and make an argument. if you don't believe in god, then why do you believe in him?","i'm not sure if you believe in god or not, but i don't think it's wrong to believe in a god. if god existed, there would be no suffering in the world.",i believe that god exists and that he is responsible for all the suffering in the world.
 A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice,"this seemed to offend people and i don't get why. and the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. and all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual romantic partners. it's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever. we have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. we tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best. there's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and i don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. and i think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition."," A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice : this seemed to offend people and i don't get why. and the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. and all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual romantic partners. it's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever. we have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. we tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best. there's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and i don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. and i think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition.",i don't think people with gender dysphoria should be allowed to transition.,"yeh the thing is i wouldn't want to take such a treatment. being trans is really crap, but it's who i am. if you took that from me then i'd be someone else. besides, if we actually did manage to produce such a thing, why not instead target it at transphobia and homophobia? if everyone took it and was no longer bigotted at all then surely that would be the better world.","i don't know if you've read any of the comments, but i think it's important to note that gender dysphoria is not a medical condition. it's a mental illness that is caused by hormones, hormones, and hormones. if you're going to treat it, you should be able to do so through hormone therapy.",i don't think it would be fair to mandate people to try a drug to stop gender dysphoria.,"what do you mean by 'transition'? i think you're missing the point of the argument. transgender people should be able to transition, but that's not the case for everyone. it's not like everyone wants to be trans. some people want to change, some people don't want to transition. they want to be the opposite gender. they just want to feel like they are the opposite sex. i don't think it's fair to force people to transition because it's a bad idea. i think it would be better to encourage people to try and transition, rather than force them to do it. i'm not sure what you're talking about, but i think that's a good idea."

 The American Civil War wasn't about slavery in the way you think it was.,"i'm not a huge history buff, but i've been trying to learn about this war and i'm having a hard time convincing myself out of this hunch. it seems to me that altruism is pretty rare in its purest form. i can't wrap my head around the notion that such a brutal conflict was fought primarily to benefit a group of people that were still treated like shit even in the states that claimed total opposition to slavery. slavery is awful, but why would young men in the north want to risk their lives for black slaves when they weren't even willing to treat free blacks with the same respect at home that they would other white folk? and correct me if i'm wrong, but didn't the north have a policy that escaped slaves were to be returned to their owners if caught? my position is this: the agrarian nature of the south required man power. the north had become more industrial and therefore did not depend on slave labour to thrive. the easiest way to cripple the south's economy would be to deprive them of their means of production while conveniently taking the moral high ground. i can't comment on the south's racism, but my feeling is that their livelihoods were more important to them than arbitrarily oppressing a race of people. could the south have really been so opposed to blacks being free that mothers would willingly sacrifice their sons to uphold slavery?

'there are urban areas in sweden which have been claimed to be no go zones. however, the swedish government states that 'no go zones', where 'criminality and gangs have taken over and where the emergency services do not dare to go' do not exist, while acknowledging that there are areas 'increasingly marred by crime, social unrest and insecurity'. 68 69 the fact checking site snopes. com agrees the idea of 'no go zones' where police cannot enter is false. 70 a 2016 report from the swedish police mapped 53 so called 'exposed' areas utsatta omr den , of which 15 were 'particularly exposed'. an 'exposed area' is an area with low socioeconomic status and the area is affected by criminality. a 'particularly exposed' area is defined by an unwillingness to participate in legal proceedings, difficulties for the police to carry out their mission, parallel social structures, violent extremism and finally proximity to other exposed areas. these definitions are used to adapt their procedures when working in these areas, for example bringing certain equipment and working in pairs when in a 'particularly exposed area'. 71 the vulnerable areas are continually improving, but if all the refugees were integrated and not dumped into ghettos, the problems would be reduced greatly. as far as refugees in general, one would hope that simple humanity would step up. literally half of the population of syria is either an internal refugee or outside the border. the number of refugees from yemen is about the same as the entire population of new york state. 94million people around the world don't have access to water. the idea that the country that produces about a quarter of the world's gdp us takes in less than 1 of the refugees disgusts me as an american citizen. but to take a completely pragmatic view, desperation breeds radicalism. if we want to do something about reducing the number of terrorists making sure that they are not in a position where they literally have nothing to lose is a good place to start. knowing that you have nothing, no chance of gaining anything, no hope for your children, constant war, and that the richest countries of the world are quarantining you there forever to die in hell is a great recruiting tool for jihadis","i think you're missing the point of the refugee crisis. it's not the refugees who are suffering, it's the refugees that are suffering. the refugees are suffering because they are not allowed to enter the country.","i'm going to start by saying that there is nothing morally wrong about countries not accepting refugees or middle eastern or muslim immigrants. i'm not sure what you mean by'morally wrong', but i think you're making the assumption that it's not morally wrong.","i don't think this is the case, but i think it's possible to argue that refugees and european countries are the same. i would say that refugees are suffering, but that's not necessarily the case. they are suffering because they have been forced to flee their home country, and they are forced to live in a country where they have no say in what happens to them."

' it's never safe, driving is not a passive action. 'complacency kills' is a good motto to repeat in your head. i would hate for you to be the person that dies because you drove the same road to work everyday for 8 years but were looking at your phone the day that road crews decided to block off that lane or a tree fell the night before or a dog dashes across the street. you are texting in the slow lane because you are assuming it is safer but in reality the fact that you think that shows that you are becoming too complacent and that makes it all the more dangerous. i'm being tough on you because my gf looked down at her phone for one second and didn't notice that the curb suddenly jutted out so she clipped it and rolled her car over. driving for 8 years at that point, and only going 35 miles an hour on a straight, empty road that she was very familiar with. luckily she was ok but it was certainly life changing for all the wrong reasons.","i don't know if you've read this yet but i think you're underestimating how much risk you are putting yourself in. if you're driving in the slow lane, you're not going to be able to see the car in front of you, and you're going to have to worry about what's going on in the lane behind you. you're also going to need to be aware of your surroundings, because if you don't, you'll be less likely to get hit by a car.","if you are not aware of your surroundings, you will not be able to see what's in front of you, which is why you should be paying attention to your surroundings.","i think it depends on the situation. if you're not paying attention to the road, you don't need to look up and using your peripherals."
" As a white man, the Sarah Jeong controversy is a nonissue for my demographic.","in my opinion, there are a few reasons why this notion is flawed. 1. as descendants of the perpetrators of almost unspeakable atrocities and as white males in the midst of a society in which many, if not most, minority groups have been made substantially worse off largely by white male authorities , being okay with being held accountable for that through humor is kinda the least we can do. i know this is gonna trigger a lot of whining about white guilt cuck and whatnot, and this is a bit of a minor point, but hear me out. america, as an idea, is built on a foundation of settler colonialism, slavery, and racism which is all too often ignored. as white people, whether or not that foundation was our own design, you can be damn sure we benefitted from it. one could easily make an argument that any wealth produced by whites in america is essentially stolen goods, since its genesis is free read: stolen land and labor. i m not sure i personally buy that argument, but frankly, i m amazed that even the most progressive social justice activists are mostly content to joke about cancelling white people which seems inherently silly and really hard to misconstrue as genuinely hateful to me . 2. privilege is pretty resilient. as an example of this, i ll use south africa. even after the anc assumes the leading role in south african government, massive differences between races persist. for example, in 2008, about 13. 6 of black south africans were hiv positive. however, according to the same study, only 0. 3 of white south africans were hiv positive. for comparison, in 2008 about 0. 2 of canadians were hiv positive. link to study: i m on mobile right now so i can t link too many more studies like this but hopefully it will suffice to say that this is but one example of how much better off ruling demographics end up even long after they exit rule. this makes me skeptical of the claim that someday racism against whites will be worse than it is now, justifying preemptive action. 3. equating racism against whites with other forms of discrimination is bad because it s an enormous false equivalency. so to clarify, in an ideal world, yes, i d agree in an abstract sense that racism is bad and shouldn t ever happen. however, in our world, lots of people are uniquely targeted by the world. black people are far more likely to be arrested, there s an ongoing epidemic of suicide in the lgbtq community, and hell, there are active concentration camps for hispanic children this side of the border. in such a world, not only is it really hard for me to care about some edgy tweets some fascist dug up, but it s also really hard for me to not feel really bad about trivializing these real and ongoing struggles against systemic oppression when magapepe1488 cries racism against a relatively harmless joke. anyway, thanks for listening to my enormous libcuck diatribe, and thanks for

about cancelling white people which seems inherently silly and really hard to misconstrue as genuinely hateful to me . 2. privilege is pretty resilient. as an example of this, i ll use south africa. even after the anc assumes the leading role in south african government, massive differences between races persist. for example, in 2008, about 13. 6 of black south africans were hiv positive. however, according to the same study, only 0. 3 of white south africans were hiv positive. for comparison, in 2008 about 0. 2 of canadians were hiv positive. link to study: i m on mobile right now so i can t link too many more studies like this but hopefully it will suffice to say that this is but one example of how much better off ruling demographics end up even long after they exit rule. this makes me skeptical of the claim that someday racism against whites will be worse than it is now, justifying preemptive action. 3. equating racism against whites with other forms of discrimination is bad because it s an enormous false equivalency. so to clarify, in an ideal world, yes, i d agree in an abstract sense that racism is bad and shouldn t ever happen. however, in our world, lots of people are uniquely targeted by the world. black people are far more likely to be arrested, there s an ongoing epidemic of suicide in the lgbtq community, and hell, there are active concentration camps for hispanic children this side of the border. in such a world, not only is it really hard for me to care about some edgy tweets some fascist dug up, but it s also really hard for me to not feel really bad about trivializing these real and ongoing struggles against systemic oppression when magapepe1488 cries racism against a relatively harmless joke. anyway, thanks for listening to my enormous libcuck diatribe, and thanks for engaging in the discussion!",it s not racist to make fun of white people.,"'it is okay for me to be racist against x group for y reasons,' justifies every racist ever. prejudice is either always wrong or it's sometimes wrong depending on who says so and why. the former statement is a safe way to end racism in the world, the second statement is a dangerous and convenient way of ensuring it never ends. and that justification can be used by anyone for any reason they see fit. everyone thinks that their reasons are good enough. ghandi said, 'be the change that you want to see in the world,' specifically because no one else can be expected to hold up your own ideals but you . if you think racism is bad and you want it to die off, then you're corrupting your own moral impotus if you make exceptions for that and are more guilty than those who don't think racism needs to end in the first place.","what about the fact that whites are disproportionately targeted by the world at large? i don't think it's fair to say that white people are disproportionately discriminated against by society at large. i think that's a bit of an oversimplification of the situation. if white people were discriminated against because of their skin color, then it would be fair to point out that they were disproportionately targeted because of the color of skin. if you look at the history of racism in the us, you'll see that it's not just white people who are discriminated against. it's also not just black people that are targeted by society, it's all black people. the vast majority of black people in america are targeted because they are black, and the majority of white people in the u. s. are targeted based on skin color. there's also a huge difference between black people and white people, and there's a difference between white people being discriminated against based on their skin colour, and black people","i think you're overlooking the fact that the american system is so riddled with racism that it's hard to see how it's ever going to change. as a white man, i don't see any reason why it shouldn't change. i see no reason why racism should be a nonissue for me.","i don't think you can make fun of white people, but i think it's fair to say that white people are more likely to be hiv positive than black people."
 Lord Farquaad's imperfect rule of DuLoc was nonetheless righteous for its time and his deposition was unjust,"what we have seen of duloc is that it is a cleanly and civil community, a beacon of modernity in a dangerous and backwards medieval time wrought with criminals, beasts, and brutal natural environments. he is the overseer of a relatively safe and burgeoning community, a rare sight given the circumstances. the fact of the matter that many fail to discuss is that fairytale creatures truly have no place in duloc. such fairytale creatures largely fail to be contributing members of society. they cannot pay taxes, they largely cannot work, yet they unfairly reap the rewards of farquaad's administration. additionally, such fairytale creatures, despite their charm, are frequently troublemakers that disturb the peace. the chaos they sow when banished to shrek's swamp serves as a prime example. while he may have overreacted when sentencing shrek to death, his demise by the dragon was uncalled for and a demonstrably better outcome could have easily be obtained."," Lord Farquaad's imperfect rule of DuLoc was nonetheless righteous for its time and his deposition was unjust : what we have seen of duloc is that it is a cleanly and civil community, a beacon of modernity in a dangerous and backwards medieval time wrought with criminals, beasts, and brutal natural environments. he is the overseer of a relatively safe and burgeoning community, a rare sight given the circumstances. the fact of the matter that many fail to discuss is that fairytale creatures truly have no place in duloc. such fairytale creatures largely fail to be contributing members of society. they cannot pay taxes, they largely cannot work, yet they unfairly reap the rewards of farquaad's administration. additionally, such fairytale creatures, despite their charm, are frequently troublemakers that disturb the peace. the chaos they sow when banished to shrek's swamp serves as a prime example. while he may have overreacted when sentencing shrek to death, his demise by the dragon was uncalled for and a demonstrably better outcome could have easily be obtained.",I believe that farquaad did not do a bad thing.,this comment will probably get deleted but i just had to say how great this post was lmao,i don't think fairytale creatures have any place in duloc. i think they have no place in the world.,"i'm not sure what you're talking about, but i'd like to point out that there are many fairytale creatures in duloc, and they have no place in the world. they're not the only fairytales creatures. there are plenty of other fairytal creatures, and there are a lot of fairytall creatures that have a place in our world. the problem with this is that it's not a perfect world. it's a very, very imperfect world.","if farquaad did not do a bad thing, then he would not have done the same thing."
 Some psychiatric drugs should be legalised (be allowed to buy over the counter) to receive without a prescription.,"i am open to listening to different opinions and why this isn t a good idea. i don t mean very serious drugs but things like anti anxiety, anti depression and anti add. i think that these drugs can be traded illegally anyway which means that there is no safety control, and the government does not get money. not everyone can afford to get a diagnosis. not everyone wants to. i, for one, do not wish to go through the official process as its expensive, time consuming and makes me nervous. now, some people might say that these drugs can be abused. we could just make a system where you need a passport id and when you buy the drugs, and your name is entered in the system, and you can only refill after a month. anxiety and ad h d are fairly common problems and quite easy to help with medication. i don t see why i cannot just go to the pharmacy and get something to help me calm down or focus. now some people may bring up side effects or potential murder risks. this is why we would have the system where you can only get monthly refills. and this is why we would only sell lighter drugs in this way. the ones least likely to cause serious side effects. and if you get a side effect?

 Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today.,"this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks."," Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today. : this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks.","I believe that if you are a white person in America, you should be able to identify people who are of a different race.","i see two major problems with your argument. first, you're using the phrase 'not likely' a lot. let's use a different example. your kid is not likely to get shot by a school shooter. when you compare the number of schools that exist in america over 100,000 to the number of school shootings that have taken place less than 500 in 175 years , we can definitively say that it is 'not likely' that your child will be the victim of a school shooting. the thing is, unsurprisingly, this doesn't make people feel better about school shootings. they still happen often enough for it to be something terrifying and abhorrent to most people, and when it does happen, it has long term and wide reaching affects. the whole nation is rocked by it, and the community that it happens in is shaken for years to come. not to mention that the lives of the survivors and of the victim's families are changed forever. all it takes is for one kid to get shot at school for thousands of kids to be afraid to go to school the next day. it's the same thing with racial issues. all it takes is one instance of blatant, public racism for black people everywhere to be afraid. so even if we agree that being the victim of racism isn't likely, is it likely enough to make whole communities afraid? that leads to the second point. racism is not always blatant. it doesn't always happen in a way that makes it clear that it is racism. most examples of racism are subtle. for example, several studies have shown that people with traditionally non white names have a harder time getting a job interview, even when they have the same qualifications as applicants with traditionally white names: since 1989, whites receive on average 36 more callbacks than african americans, and 24 more callbacks than latinos. we observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against african americans over the past 25 years, although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against latinos. so when you say, 'you likely did not get rejected from that job because you are black' we can demonstrate that that isn't true. that doesn't mean that betty in hr is a raging racist who dreams of dawning a klan hood one day. it could be that even she doesn't know why john seems more qualified than hakeem. it's just a gut feeling. the same reason why my grandmother always locked the car doors when we were sitting at a stop light and a black man was waiting to cross the street. she never did that with white men. this kind of subtle racism is the most prevalent, and the hardest to prove as well. i can't prove that your dad was stopped at that store because he was black. but how do you know that it wasn't, and what makes you believe that subtle acts of racial bias aren't as pervasive as people who experience them say they are?","it's not likely that racist people still exist, but it is likely that they are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day.","i don't think it's 'racist' to blame racism, but it's not 'black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today.</conclusion><premises> you are stupid and is not likely to happen today.","if you're white, you should be able to identify people who are of a different race."
 I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome.,"the title shows my basic premise when it comes to politics. i think people should have no governmental obstacles to stop them from being able to succeed from their own merit. i think that if you are a hard worker, you deserve to be able to work your way to the top, seek out knowledge, and stand above those who weren t able to succeed the way you did. you should be able to work your way from the bottom and get to be a ceo or the president or any other top level position if you work and learn and push yourself to the top. i don t think for instance, having affirmative action programs are a good idea. the way i understand it, they try to push for diversity by for example, if two people both have the same qualifications, or indeed even if one is higher than the other, the one with lower or equal standards could get accepted instead, solely based on their race or other criteria, even if they were less qualified. another example is if you have 3 people in a room, a, b, and c. a earns a lot of money, and gets taxed at a higher rate than both b and c, despite the fact that a works harder than b and c. just because he has more money, that money is redistributed to b and c so they can also get a higher standard of living, even though they didn t work for it like a did. these kinds of ideas i think are counterproductive, especially the more they increase. in my last example for instance, if everyone was to give all their money to d, who then combined all the money and then gave it back to a b and c equally, then you end up with a problem. if a knows their money will just be given back to the b and c anyway, why try and make so much more money? and b and c, why would they try and earn more money if they know that they can just rely on a to get it for them? so now a, b, and c all have less incentive to work, and therefore they all have less money. welfare programs promote this kind of behavior as well. instead if we took it in the complete opposite direction, and they all kept everything they had, then they would all have an incentive to earn more money. a could get richer, and even employ b and c if they were willing to work for a, and b and c would realize that they couldn t just rely on a to get everything for them. they would have to work in order to survive, and would therefore have to earn things for themselves. they all have an incentive to work, and therefore must better themselves to earn things. this principle can be applied to many things, such as speech, wherein the opportunity would be everyone can speak their mind. if b and c decided that they didn t like something that a said, they could simply not associate with him. they could instead speak how they wanted to, and tell a to buzz off, and associate with what they want. if outcome was put into place, and a was not allowed to say those things that b and c didn t like, then b and c would feel more comfortable, but a wouldn t be allowed to express their opinions, and would therefore lead to a less diverse group of opinions and discussions. also, if a was to open a shop and discriminate against gay people for instance, if they all had equal opportunity, then b could open up a shop, and c might decide that they don t like a s policy that much, or perhaps c is gay as well, and decide to go to b. this would rob a of his business, and he would either be forced to change his policy, or lose money because of the customers that didn t like his policy or were refused because of it. if they all had the same outcome, this couldn t happen, but if a was religious, and didn t want to serve these gay people for instance, then it would violate his freedom of religion. i should also mention that i think this is better from a moral standpoint as well, not just a logical standpoint. in the first example, b and c are taking a s money and giving it to themselves just because a earned more than they did. they are taking away a s right to their money. in the second example, b and c are taking away a s right to speak as he chooses. he said something they didn t like or agree with, and said by law, you cannot say that anymore. i should make a distinction that this is different if a said i am going to kill you. that implies he is about to attack you, and you should be able to criminalize that. i m referring to if a said b should die in a fire. that s not nice, but it doesn t imply action. a shouldn t be criminalized for saying something mean. in the third example, b and c are taking away a s right to choose who a gives their service to. no one has a right to someone s services. in this example, the government is forcing a to do something that he doesn t want to do, violating his religious beliefs as well. that is my stance when it comes to politics. change my view!"," I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome. : the title

change my view!","i think everyone should have the right to pursue their own dreams, and not be limited by others.","i wrote this quickly so i apologize if it isn't clear is rushed. i legitimately disagree with some of your claims so i looked through the responses and didn't find any that aligned with my own objections though there are a lot of responses so if you have come across this one already, then i apologize . your thought process is great. you are beginning with a certain simplified worldview and then elaborating based on motivation, taxation, notions of what makes a good society, a good economy etc. the fundamental problem is that your initial simplified worldview is fictional or, at the very least, it does not apply in general circumstances and is thereby of only partial use meaning that you ought to supplement your view with other views when the initial conditions do not hold . i will try to illustrate this in two ways. first, you begin with 3 people in a room, a, b, and c, and you ask us to imagine that a works harder than b and c, and that a thereby earns more money. a is taxed higher and yada yada yada. this is indeed a possible circumstance. but it is not the only possible circumstance. suppose, instead, you have 3 people a, b, and c. they are clones, equal in every way. equally hard working, equally smart, equally qualified etc. there is one job opening available in this room. all three apply. all are equally qualified, but one job cannot be given to three people. accordingly, an arbitrary decision process results in person a obtaining the job. person a now makes a bunch of money and person b and c have none. the inequality in outcome, in this circumstance, is not based on hard work, or skill, determination, merit, intelligence whatever else you want to apply. i propose that the situation i have put forth, is just as relevant to the world as the situation you put forth. but your conclusions do not apply to this new situation. i would go even further though i don't expect you to be convinced by this, and making such an argument isn't essential to making my point in this post and say that the meritocracy is fictional. second, inequality in opportunity is readily apparent in the world today. i was born into a middle class family with disposable income. i was raised in an enriched environment with lots of books, emphasis on education, sports, solid reinforcement etc. not everyone has such opportunities. i have friends who had more opportunity than me. they went to private school, international trips, family members in high ranking positions in notable companies who could get them job placements. i have friends who had fewer opportunities than me. raised by single parents who had to work multiple low paying jobs just to afford rent and food, and thereby couldn't direct as much time money to environmental enrichment. this is obvious not to mention political inequalities in marginalized groups, racial inequalities, sexual, other possible inequalities , but a more general point is worth making here. there is a common tendency illustrated in your own case to suppose that intelligence, hard work, resourcefulness, cleverness, cut throatness etc. are for some reason starting properties, rather than outcomes themselves. that is, you are assuming that 'hard worker' is something that people are born with and that this somehow serves as a starting point for an idealized equality of opportunity world. this is certainly not the case. being a 'hard worker' is as much the outcome of a process as is wealth inequality. is there even such thing is equality of opportunity? two general points in closing. 1. inequality of outcome will facilitate social unrest, if that inequality is sufficiently pronounced. social unrest can be extremely dangerous, and limiting social unrest is a benefit for those with and without power. if in your hypothetical room person b and c could get very pissed off and decide to burn the room down and overthrow the system that allows person a to have inequality of outcome, it may be in person a's best interest to give up some of what he has earned, so as to perpetuate the social conditions in the room that allow him such benefits. 2. there is a silly tendency to attribute social power success to something innate inherent in a person. and this long predates genetics and the notion that genetics determine who you are is generally a very silly claim and widely known to be such among biologists experts think of monarchs who had their inherent social power justified through god and, oddly, those who overthrew those monarchs also had their social power justified through the same god. such appeals to innateness may explain inequalities of outcome though other explanations are possible or may make such inequalities seem inevitable ostensible inevitability is a powerful mechanism of social control . but why does some innate inherent quality justify inequality of outcome? i'm not sure so i bring this up to point that out to you and others. why does innate difference justify inequality of outcome? it seems to me that, in some areas at least we generally do not think this to be the case eg. in democracies today at least in the west we generally allow equal political power to each individual at least as an ideal , regardless of whether the person is a genius or an idiot, wealthy or poor, man or woman, white or black, tall or short.","i don't think there's a whole lot of merit in your argument, and i don't really think it's fair to say that you should have no governmental obstacles to stop people from being able to succeed from their own merit. i think you're missing the point of the argument, which is that it's impossible for people to be able to work their way up to the top, regardless of their merit. there are plenty of people who are able to get a job, but that doesn't mean that they can't work for it. it's just that you don't have any incentive to work at all.","i don't understand what you're trying to say, but i'm going to try to change your view here. i'm not going to argue that equality of opportunity is more important than equality of outcome, but that's a different topic. the idea is that you should have no governmental obstacles to stop someone from being able to succeed from their own merit. i don't think that's the case. i think that people should be able to work their way to the top, seek out knowledge, and stand above those who weren't able to do the same.","i don't think this is a good idea, but i think it's a great idea. i think we should have a system in place to allow people to pursue their own dreams, and not be limited by others. for example, let's say you're a

 The future of humanity is NOT in outer space,"i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system? well, first let's consider our reasons for colonizing these planets in the first place. most of these planets are either too hot or too cold to sustain life, with the most likely exception being mars, venus, and a number of moons, including our own. even so, these planets present incredibly hostile environments; they are home to extreme temperatures, little to no oxygen, and most likely no liquid water whatsoever. there are theories as to how we might be able to terraform these planets, making it possible for humans to survive there, although needless to say that won't be an easy process. while there is little doubt earth is becoming less habitable to humans, the reality is we currently have water, oxygen, food, plant life, and temperatures humans can survive in almost everywhere on the planet. if it is possible to terraform an environment which is as hostile as mars or venus, shouldn't it also be possible to re terraform earth? wouldn't this be much easier, and a much more productive use of our resources? so perhaps we don't need to colonize other planets, but they are still home to a number of resources that we can benefit from here on earth, right? maybe we can simply set up mining stations throughout our solar system, and bring minerals back to earth. the problem with this is that inter planar travel costs a lot of resources as it is. transporting mining equipment and mining staff to another planet, and transporting a significant quantity valuable minerals back to earth would be extremely cost inefficient. admittedly we would also be granted access to entire planets worth of raw materials, so some might argue that the trade off is ultimately worth it, but keep in mind that we would also need to burn enormous amounts of fuel, and since we currently depend primarily on fossil fuels, we most likely wouldn't be able to find anything of comparable value anywhere else in the solar system. remember that we are currently facing the risk of running out of fossil fuels entirely, and that they are, as the name suggests, made of organic material. with this in mind, it is almost impossible that we will find anything like it elsewhere in our solar system. like i said at the beginning, this is a massive bummer, and i truly hope i'm wrong. i do not have a background in science, and there is a good chance i don't know what i'm talking about, so if you are able to change my view, i would be extremely happy. that being said, if i'm right, i believe the scientific community would be better off recognizing this hard truth, and dedicating their resources to something more productive than space travel, such as researching ways to make the earth continue to be inhabitable."," The future of humanity is NOT in outer space : i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system?

 Sex-selective abortions in Western countries should remain legal,"they can cause disastrous demographic shifts, similar to those china and india are seeing in certain regions. this reasoning is not applicable in western countries for several reasons: 1 children of all genders are equally welcome, for the most part. while sexism, homophobia, or transphobia certainly can affect children as they age, parents probably aren't going to select for one sex over the other in significant numbers. 2 parents who are willing to abort a fetus of the wrong gender will probably mistreat that child as he or she ages. if you're committed enough to get a relatively late abortion i. e. at the 18 week range because you want a boy, there's a reasonable chance you won't be a good parent to a daughter you're forced to have. 3 any laws limiting abortion based on gender will disproportionately affect minorities. doctors will assume that the abortion is because of the fetus's sex and deny certain segments of the population care, for fear of breaking the law. moreover, winding back abortion rights is dangerous in today's political climate. cmv!"," Sex-selective abortions in Western countries should remain legal : they can cause disastrous demographic shifts, similar to those china and india are seeing in certain regions. this reasoning is not applicable in western countries for several reasons: 1 children of all genders are equally welcome, for the most part. while sexism, homophobia, or transphobia certainly can affect children as they age, parents probably aren't going to select for one sex over the other in significant numbers. 2 parents who are willing to abort a fetus of the wrong gender will probably mistreat that child as he or she ages. if you're committed enough to get a relatively late abortion i. e. at the 18 week range because you want a boy, there's a reasonable chance you won't be a good parent to a daughter you're forced to have. 3 any laws limiting abortion based on gender will disproportionately affect minorities. doctors will assume that the abortion is because of the fetus's sex and deny certain segments of the population care, for fear of breaking the law. moreover, winding back abortion rights is dangerous in today's political climate. cmv!",Laws restricting abortion based on gender are wrong.,point 1 contradicts both point 2 and the conclusion itself. if children of all genders are equally welcome then there should be no need for sex selective abortions.,i don't think it's a good idea to allow women to have children of their own. i think it would be a better idea to restrict abortions to women who are willing to have a child of her own.,"i'm going to take a stab at this. i'm not going to argue that sexselective abortions should be legal, but i don't think it's a good idea to do so in the first place. there are a lot of people who don't want to have children of the wrong sex, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to have kids of the same sex.","i don't see the point of this argument. i think it's important to note that there is a lot of debate about whether or not a law should be enforced on the basis of gender. for example, there are plenty of studies that show that women have a higher chance of having an abortion than men. this may not be the case for men, but it seems to me that women are more likely to have an abortion due to the fact that men have a lower chance of getting an abortion."

 Weed is bad for you. Smoking it has many short and long term consequences.,"everyone likes to argue that it's not as bad as other drugs but it still can be very psychologically addictive and damaging. smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes which society has agreed are bad for you so why does everyone pretend that this is ok? everyday it seems i can find new studies that have more and more downsides to marijuana smoke in the short and long term and i just don't understand why people seem to think that there are no downsides here. medicinally it still is considered to have no medical benefits and i don't really see how it possibly could as current understanding of thc which is the strongest known cannabinoid in marijuana seems to cause more harm then good. i can understand that cbd is being shown to be successful in treating things like chronic pain and anxiety however thc vastly outnumbers cbd in weed and smoking to get these effects seems counterproductive. i feel as if medical marijuana companies are trying to piggyback off the false notion that it's a harmless drug and push it onto people asap similarly to how tobacco companies operated back in the day. at the end of the day these companies are profitable off addiction and they have ulterior motives when it comes to testing this stuff. they say things like it's not as bad as alcohol or tobacco cigarette but to me this seems like a logical fallacy as one could really justify any reckless behavior this way. one of the main reasons i've been so torn up on this lately is that a lot of my friends including my girlfriend started smoking and have definitely changed. it bothers me. it bothers me that they started presumingly under age and were not fully aware of the consequences and now a lot seem to have dependencies on the drug. they claim it's fine but in my eyes it's the same as smoking as cigarette, at least in the physical sense, and if people smoke tobacco to unwind most people would agree that it's very unhealthy to form habits around that. at the end of the day, smoking every once in a while won't kill you in the same way occasionally smoking a cig won't kill you, however i believe that having a dependency on anything is not healthy and weed is no exception."," Weed is bad for you.

having a dependency on anything is not healthy and weed is no exception.",I believe that marijuana is nearly as bad as tobacco and should be treated as such.,"i noticed you were linking this old webmd article to another person? but why link a 2007 article over the newest one? although it does have similarity to the other article with cons. it newly states that marijuana has never been proved to be linked to lung cancer, and that a link hasnt been found. they say thats due to limited time for research. because its illegal on a federal lvl research is hard to come by until recently. it also states that in animal research there are things in marijuana that might actually fight tumor growth, but further research is needed. and people have actually used weed to help cancer. which supposedly worked in this young child, that was given suppliments to try to fight cancer. i would link this but im drunk and jus chillin and its gonna take awhile. i dont think weed cures cancer, especially if you smoke it, but i think its possible that it did something to help this girl. i personally only use a vaporizer, and drink very rarely. heres the part where i kinda support part of your argument, weed can be very addictive and is totally a gateway drug. although the other than weed and alcohol iv just tried xanax ones or twice. xanax is powerful, dangerous, not in a psychedelic way, but in a ruins your life and you forget everything tired depressed way. but ever since iv started smoking weed the habit only gets bigger, now its pretty much daily, every night before i go to sleep i always chill w a quick smoke, always vaporizing, which release no tar like smoking does. it only heats the thc and cbd to a temperature where it is active, kinda what they do to make weed ready for edibles, before adding it to the mixture. there are many studies showing that the smokes chemicals and tar excretion from vaporizing is significantly less from just regularly smoking weed like in a joint. and when weed is smoked through a water pipe bong some of the tar and carcinogens are removed through the water. i digress, i kinda wish i never started smoking, its a nessesity that i spend a good amount of money on and that makes me happy. i want to do most things high, and pretty much always smoke if i got weed. and i always can get some so i always buy some. i am noted as an extremely intelligent person, weird wording but me and all my siblings have gone to ivy league schools harvard, standford etc i am not trying to flex, but because i started generally young, i feel that smoking weed has limited my potential. i think if i stopped for a long period of time, my great memory would come back, but come on did i ever have a great memory or do i just think i had a better one. sometimes i take a week break to reset tolerance a bit, or if i really need to focus on something, out of weed etc but i always have the intention to start again in a week and always do. its pretty much impossible to break the cycle because why the fuck would i break the cycle. smoking weed is just, great sometimes. its not meth its not coke, but it can really let you appreciate life, especially music. its not too late for me, i hope. i dont fit in with stoners, or dealers. i fit in with smart sober people. when im sober. when im high im just a responsible guy whos tryna smoke because everything fucking sucks. im sorry for the rant, im pretty sure iv been writing this for over around 45 minutes. what if this post was archived or some shit and i just wasted all that fucking time lmfaoooo please nooooo. i wonder if any of this even makes sense. dont start smoking. its not good for you, and in my opinion somehow extremely addictive, without being addictive at all. the analogy i always use is, weeds like pizza for pizza lovers , its good as fuck. its not nicotine, or opiods. it just tastes good, or feels good. and you kinda want it, when your sad, when your happy, when your bored, when your in a great mood. pizza could just make life fucking great if we could eat it all the time without gaining weight. well some people see the possibly negative effects because weight gain is visible but weed abuse isnt. if i could eat pizza all day any day. i truly would cause that shit is great. and although weed so far isnt a gateway drug for me. you'll start w it and move on to something else especially if its offered to you. acid overall isnt horrible, it isnt addictive and most people take it to have a crazy trip extremely rarely, others take it every weekend, but that is the low 1 or less. coke, meth, heroin, crack, are some of the worst most addictive terrible things in the word, they are pure man made chemicals, that fuck up your appearance not really coke but the others yes , and are so extremely addictive that you literally need them. immediatly. while molly mdma and acid are on the safer side. xanax and alcohol are very similar to weed, alcohols more addictive and definetly impairs driving way more than weed. but never drive with any drug in system. xanax is the most addictive and most dangerous. its a legal prescribed medicine that you can overdose on like every thing iv mentioned except weed and it completely changes personality and destroys memory and emotions. i need to stop writing damn. goodnight bro. i hope you read this, please argue w me","i agree with you, but i don't think it's the same thing as smoking cigarettes. if you smoke a cigarette, you're going to get a lot of side effects from it.","i'm not sure i agree with you, but i think it's important to note that there are many side effects to marijuana. the first is that it can be addictive. the second is that you can use it to unwind and unwind. the third is that people tend to be more likely to use it as a stimulant. i don't know if this is the case, but it seems to me that many people use marijuana as a way of unwinding and unwinding. the fourth is that

 The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive.,"what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies."," The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive. : what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies.",I believe that we should tax the rich and give the money to the poor.,"it increases the price, but not be nearly as much as you apparently think it is and not really a cyclical problem as you've suggested either. basic economic principles means that the government paying x for everyone's college would raise the price of college somewhere between 0 and x depending on the elasticity of supply and demand how consumers and providers choose to respond to price changes . the fact that the government doesn't offer financial aid to everyone is just going to make the price rise that much closer to the 0 end of things. but consumers as a whole will never be worse off if the government offers to pay for some college expenses. suppose widgets sell for 25 and the government comes along and offers everyone a free 10 if they buy a widget, so now it only costs people 15. suppose each person has an internal value for how much they are willing to buy a widget for. people who were willing to pay 25 were already buying widgets. people who aren't willing to pay even 15 will continue to not buy widgets. and anyone paynig between 15 25 will now buy widgets and claim the government money. the widget maker can respond to this in a number of ways. they could start producing more widgets to serve the people who are willing to pay 15 25. or they could raise their prices to up to 35 and get the whole 10 for themselves but get none of the benefit of additional sales. the only case in which they'd probably do the second one is if there is a strictly limited supply and making more just isn't really an option. why can't they raise the price above 35? well they would sell even less than they were originally and that isn't how sellers respond to things. as they make more money per sale they make more, not less. here is a more visual explanation of how the supply and demand curves respond to a subsidy like this one. unless the supply curve is vertical, meaning they just don't respond to changes in price by offering just as many spots no matter the price they can get and no new colleges opening up offering classes either when the price increases , then the consumer will also benefit from the subsidy. the overall price for consumers will be cheaper. but with a selective subsidy you can have some consumers hurt a little . the base price won't increase by as much as if everyone got the subsidy, but for anyone not getting the subsidy, they could end up paying a little more then before the subsidy.","the problem with this is that it doesn't work out. if you want to get rid of subsidies, you need to give them the money to do so. if they don't want to do it, you can't give them that money. it's not like they can't do whatever they want.","i think you're missing the point of the system. it's not about the government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate of manner it does, it's about the university providing financial aid for students and universities.","you're right that we should tax the rich and give the money to the poor, but you're wrong that the rich should be given the money. the poor should be able to do whatever they want and then bailing them out."

found that men are more likely to not be turned off by an overly interested woman in their first meeting while woman are more likely to be turned off by an overly interested man in their first meeting. this makes sense. woman are more likely to be victims of gendered violence and harassment and are pretty much told from a young age to be wary of overly interested men whom are strangers in this study . 2nd source: someone who is arrogant and manipulative, and willing to be so, is more likely to have more sex, volk's team found. well nah shit. people who manipulate people are going to be able to have more one night stands. you do realise the person being manipulated does not realise they are being manipulated. this invalidates your point completly. manipulates pretend to be great people. that is the point. they found that regardless of gender, teens with low humility honesty readings were more likely to bully and to use that bullying as a strategy to have more sex. so they manipulate and bully someone into sex or a relationship. so the victim here the person being bullied clearly isn t making a choice. this study completly invalidates your points. bad people manipulate pretend to be good people and bully partners into sex. 3rd source: however, bullying may be an effective behavior primarily for adolescents who possess personality traits that make them willing and able to use bullying as a strategy for obtaining sexual partners. same as the previous one. bad people either manipulate pretend to be nice or bully their partner into sex. this is not willing. this is not a choice. clearly if they have to manipulate or bully someone into sex then the partner isn t choosing based off bad traits they are either being forced or they believe the person has good traits. both these studies say there is no gender split. the same results occur with females and males. 4th source: this is an artical reporting on your 3rd source. are you reading your sources? are you just reading headlines? 5th source:link is broken for me. 6th source:this is another artical reporting on your 3rd and 4th source. please read your sources. why are you quoting sources and not reading them? 7th source: this is another artical about a study you have already quoted. this is an artical about your 1st source. 8th source:firstly, this is about short term relationship. it is about how men are able to manipulate read: pretend to have nice traits women for short term sex. narcissism and psychopathy are about short term charm and short term manipulation. this does not support your point at all. this shows that woman prefer nice traits. it shows that some men know woman prefer nice traits and use this to manipulate them. the traits of the prefered man are: the manipulation, exploitation, deceit and flattery of others; a lack of remorse, morality concerns and sensitivity, and cynicism. you do not realise when you are getting manipulated or exploitation. that is the point of them. you do not realised whem you are getting decited. that is the point. this study completly goes agaisnt what you say. the obvious conclusion is that to sleep with women men pretend to be nice guys. they pretend to have nice traits. woman fall for this. because they want nice traits. these men can only keep up the lie so long. after the lie and thus the nice traits stop the relationship stops as well. 9th source: i am going to put this in all caps because i do not understand why you have done this so many times. is it to inflate the number of sources you have so it seems more real? is it because you thought no one would read your sources? this is another source reporting on a source you have already posted. 10th source:this study admits itself that they do not think it is fully complete and they don t want to make conclusions. a key point of narcissism is manipulation. again, bad people pretending to be good people. 11th source: oh great. it starts off with a bloggers opinion. i m going to compeltly ignore the begining on some random person s opinions and skip to where they quote a study. i mean i m sure you won t mind since you didn t even read the sources. the study involves data extracted from the internet. great. no one lies on the internet for attention. no one pretends on the internet. and it was based on web searches, posts, and erotica. that is solid. none of that is exaggerated at all. i mean, when i look into what attracts men i just look up the most popular video on pornhub and conclude that is what all men are attracted to 100 of the time 100 of men. yep. oh, super. the data collected is so vaired that you could draw two completly different conclusions on it. by the way, ted bundy dod recieve letters from a large amount of women read: a couple hundred at most . he was a psychopath. he was manipulative. do we need to talk about what manipulative people do? they don t tell people they are manipulative. wanna know who recieve thousands and thousands and millions of letters and fans? boy bands. all of whom have an uptight, nice, gentleman like attitude. 12th source:1st, are you really really really legitmatly sourcing an anonymous blog post on incels. men who wish cancer on women, men who wish rape on women, men who degrade women and call them feminoids , men who expect sex. shouldn t they, according to you, be recieving sex? they are horribly degrading and disgusting people. shouldn t, according to you, women be falling head over heels for them? why aren t they? 2nd, i am not going to trust an ed out blog post of several studies. that is not a legitmate source. link the actual studies. oh look. look what we have here linked as a source. a source you have already linked stop repeating sources it does not make anything more legitmate. so in conclusion. you only have maybe 5 sources here of different studies. nearly all refute your point since it is about manipulation. the one that isn t about manipulation is about woman worrying about manipulation. do you have any sources that support the point you are making? if not, why do you believe your point despite there being no evidence?","i don't think it's fair to say that people who are sexually attracted to their spouse are the ones who are most attracted to them. i think it is fair to assume that this is the case for women who are attracted to men, and that it's not fair to expect men to be attracted to women who aren't attracted to themselves.",i don't think women are hardwired to want violent men and to reject good men.,"i think you're misunderstanding the purpose of the study. it's not to show that women don't like assholes, it's to show men that they don't need assholes. the studies and parents talk about choosing a

i've see comments i think are trying to undermine my belief in this because some points made aren't adequate for me but are for someone else. thank you to everyone so far. this continues to be a productive thread, in my mind.",i believe that the number of children that die every year in the world is proof that god exists.,"i ll try to answer this one by walking through some premises that fit together:god loves all his children. because he loves his children, he wants them to experience the joy and glory that he experiences. he wants his children to become like him. this requires that they have experiences to learn and to grow. in order for his children to have these experiences, god created a world for them to live on. through adam and eve, this world became a fallen world a world which includes pain and suffering, unfairness, and requires work. this is a necessary step in god s plan to teach his children and help them grow. they must be allowed to live in a fallen world away from his presence and progress by choosing to do good even though they are not with him. i suppose the best way to describe what i mean by fallen world is a world which includes entropy, a gradual decline into disorder. there s a duality here god s children cannot know true joy unless they have experienced sorrow no pleasure without pain, no virtue without vice. in short, god sends his children to a fallen world so that they might be able to experience both the good and the bad, and learn to choose the good. as other commenters have mentioned, free will is an essential part of god s plan for his children. god does not generally intervene and infringe upon the free will given to his children, even if not intervening means that there will be suffering. not all suffering is caused by free will, and i see that your argument is mainly related to this type of suffering suffering not caused by the free will of others. in my belief, this suffering comes because of the fallen world we live in. our physical bodies are imperfect, and are subject to horrible things like cancer. god allows this because people learn from suffering and because he has a plan for everything to be made right in the next life. this life can be viewed as but a small moment in an eternity of growth and progression. if one believes in a life after this, and that the growth and experiences received here will be carried into the next life, one can believe that all experiences on earth, both positive and negative, make it possible for god s children to experience the joy of becoming more like him. if god loves his children, then he wants the best for them, and the best gift he can offer them is the type of life he lives. now, since according to scripture, no unclean thing can enter into god s presence, all of his children that came to live in this fallen world, no matter what they do, are prevented from returning to his physical presence after death. this on its own would completely foil his plan to allow his children to return to live with him with the knowledge and growth they gained on earth. because god loves his children, he provided a way that this obstacle could be overcome. he sent jesus, whose atoning sacrifice provided the reconciliation necessary for his children to be able to return to god s presence after death. if you believe in jesus, you believe that his great suffering and sacrifice is the way through which god is able to make fair all that was unfair in this life. you give the specific case of the vast number of children that die every year this is a great question that causes many to ask your very same question. the question, your question, is: how can we believe god loves his children when their is so much suffering, especially when those suffering are innocent children? the answer requires acceptance of the premises explained above that:1. this life is not all. 2. this life is the means to an end, which end is joy in the presence of god. 3. god provided a way that all that is unfair in this life can be made right in an eternal perspective. 4. the suffering we experience in this life intimately helps us to grow and progress this progression is essential in an eternal perspective. specifically, depending on which judeo christian religion you ask about children that die, you ll get different answers. here s the answer that makes sense to me given the above premises:children and innocents who suffer and die early in this life will have everything made right in the next life. babies that die go to heaven. in summary, you can reconcile the suffering that takes place in this world and the statement that god loves his children if you believe in the statements above. even if you don t believe in the statements, you can still accept that this is how those who do believe in god reconcile believing that he loves them with the suffering in the world.",it's not like god is omnipotent or omniscient. it's just that he's omnipotent. so i don't think there's a rational explanation for the number of children dying a year.,"i don't believe in a loving god, but i do believe in the existence of a loving deity. i believe that there is a god who is omnipotent and omniscient, and that he is the only one capable of being omnipotent.","if god exists, then that is proof that god exists. if you believe that god is omnipotent and omnipresent, then you are wrong. there is no reason to believe that the number of children that die every year in the world is proof of god's existence."

 Pascal's Wager is ultimately meaningless because it ignores the existence of other religions.,"arguments for the belief in a god or gods fascinate me, but none have ever really made me question my agnosticism as much as pascal's wager. amp;

x200b; i think logical proof should be answered with logical proof, so i drafted a quick counter argument. i am by no means a logican or a philosopher, so i fully expect there to be holes in my argument, and i would welcome criticism of it so that i can either improve it or discard it. i think arguments 10 and 11 are where this argument is weakest, and i d love to hear suggestions for how to prove the probabilistic application of averages. amp; x200b; 1. god is, or god is not. reason cannot decide between the two alternatives. 2. 3. choosing the correct god provides infinite benefit. 4. 5. it logically follows from 3 that the set of all possible values for the number of gods is the set of all natural numbers. 6. since the set increments at a linear rate, the median of the set is equal to the average. 7. the position of the median in a set can determined by dividing the size of the set by two. 8. any infinite number divided by a finite number is infinite. the limit of f x x 2 as x approaches infinity is infinity 9. it could be said then, that the average value of this set is infinity. 10. in a universe where it could be proved that there were between one and three gods, it would be most logical to make probabilistic decisions assuming there are two gods, just as it is most logical to make decisions about dice considering the average result of that die. 11. thus, it makes most sense to make probabilistic decisions assuming that there are an infinite number of possible gods. 12. if there are an infinite number of possible gods, the chance of choosing the right one approaches 0, just as the rewards from picking the correct one approach infinity. 13. if one has an infinitesimally small chance at an infinitely big reward, one can say that the expected value of the choice is undefined and that the reward is thus irrelevant. amp;

x200b; i think logical proof should be answered with logical proof, so i drafted a quick counter argument. i am by no means a logican or a philosopher, so i fully expect there to be holes in my argument, and i would welcome criticism of it so that i can either improve it or discard it. i think arguments 10 and 11 are where this argument is weakest, and i d love to hear suggestions for how to prove the probabilistic application of averages. amp; x200b; 1. god is, or god is not. reason cannot decide between the two alternatives. 2. 3. choosing the correct god provides infinite benefit. 4. 5. it logically follows from 3 that the set of all possible values for the number of gods is the set of all natural numbers. 6. since the set increments at a linear rate, the median of the set is equal to the average. 7. the position of the median in a set can determined by dividing the size of the set by two. 8. any infinite number divided by a finite number is infinite. the limit of f x x 2 as x approaches infinity is infinity 9. it could be said then, that the average value of this set is infinity. 10. in a universe where it could be proved that there were between one and three gods, it would be most logical to make probabilistic decisions assuming there are two gods, just as it is most logical to make decisions about dice considering the average result of that die. 11. thus, it makes most sense to make probabilistic decisions assuming that there are an infinite number of possible gods. 12. if there are an infinite number of possible gods, the chance of choosing the right one approaches 0, just as the rewards from picking the correct one approach infinity. 13. if one has an infinitesimally small chance at an infinitely big reward, one can say that the expected value of the choice is undefined and that the reward is thus irrelevant. amp;

 Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control. Forgiving this shows lack of self respect.,"i noticed that cheating has been normalized especially with people of color poc in the media and in real life. it's sexist if you ask me. let me first define cheating. cheating is telling your partner you won't be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship, but still doing it. it's not considered cheating to me if it's an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot. also, when talking of relationships, i mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them. i don't want to hear of forced marriages, abusive relationships, or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what i'm thinking about. if the passion has died in your relationship, it is better to break off the relationship. i don't mean divorce though cause i know that involves money and can be messy, but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least. to me, if you cheat that means you don't love your so. if you really love your so and understand the pain it would cause them, you wouldn't consider cheating. if your so is having problems sexually and you cheat, that's basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared. there's also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue. and if it's that big of a deal and unsolvable, you can move on to an open relationship or seperate break up. people who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship and or the emotional support they felt in the relationship. i feel when people take back people who cheat, it's because they don't feel they'll ever find anyone to replace what they had which can be a valid point, but still sad desperate . imo i feel it's a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that. i feel this all makes perfect sense, but it's like the older i get the more people are acting like i'm living in fantasy land. beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women. great men are taking back women who cheat too. what's going on?"," Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control.

people consistently undervalue is that while cheating is a horrible thing to do to a person, it doesn't necessarily disregard the entire history that two people may have shared together. i've seen several older couples that find out one of the people cheated over decades. to be sure, once that knowledge is out, the relationship is forever changed. also note, that there was a huge discrepancy in the two people's understandings of what the relationship was to begin with. one person thought they were both being faithful, the other spent a significant amount of energy hiding some amount of their activities from their partner. once cheating becomes known, the relationship cannot be what it was, because it wasn't what it was claiming to be before that point anyway. to get back to why someone might forgive a cheater and it's ok: have you tried dating people? 90 of the people you will find in the dating pool are just not a good match for you, and a significant portion of those people are just not ready for a meaningful relationship to begin with. comparing that to a partner who cheated, in a simple pros cons format, will often place the cheater on the better side of the comparison, even with the huge 'cheated on me' con. the relationship likely had many positives before the cheating was known, and most of those positives haven't changed. ie: if the partner was worth staying with before the cheating and actively making the subjects life better, then once the cheating is known, they aren't making the subjects life as good as they once were, but it's still a net positive. going back to the older couples, sometimes it just isn't worth it to go back into the dating pool, you simply don't have enough time left in this world for it to be worth it. you might argue that is because they are showing less self respect, but i would argue that is merely accepting the facts of life. the world is what it is and you can do a simple math analysis on how many years it takes to get to a point of trust with a person. clearly, a cheater has ruined a significant amount of trust, especially physical intimacy, but relationships are about a lot more than that, and a truly sorry cheater can spend the rest of their years how many years is that anyway? making it up to their partner. not a very romantic solution, but definitely a situation that favors the forgiver. you mentioned the financial aspects of a relationship, and cheating actually has basically 0 impact on that. i once sat in a psychology class having to write an argument about the phrase 'those who marry for money get all that they deserve' and my only critique on the statement was 'why are the words 'for money' in that sentence? those who marry get all that they deserve, it doesn't matter what your reasons are, if you marry purely for love, you're just as big a fool' maybe the love is gone, maybe they aren't a really big fan of their partner personally, but the financial aspects of the marriage mean their whole life is fairly easy as long as they don't separate, or in some cases, initiate separation. this can, again, be a net positive. sometimes, people are just punishing themselves or whatever by keeping a cheater, but a lot of the time, it's not so much forgiving the cheater for cheating as much as acknowledging that life is just better by keeping them, even though it will never be as good as it might have seemed. that might sound depressing, but i've seen it in action. i've seen someone leave a cheater, only to come back 4 years later because things just weren't working out, and life with a cheater is better than what it was without the cheater. easy decision to make from that perspective. typo's and stuff, at this point i'm done.",it's not a sexual relationship. it's a romantic relationship. you can't have a relationship with someone who doesn't want to have sex with you. you don't have to have an open relationship with them. you have to be willing to be open about it.,"if you're a woman, and you're in a relationship with a man, that's fine. if you're not, then it's fine to cheat on him. but if you aren't, then you can't cheat on anyone else.","you seem to be conflating two things. firstly, you seem to think that cheating is a bad idea, and secondly, that you don't care about the emotional bond you shared with your partner. there are plenty of people who have cheated on their partner, and that doesn't mean that they don't want to continue their relationship. second, i don't think it's fair to say that there are people who don't really care about their partner's emotional bond. that's why people don't break up with each other. i think that it's unfair to judge someone based on their emotional bond with their partner. in fact, it's a lot easier to judge a person based on emotional bond than it is to judge them based on how they feel about the relationship."

Capitalism is a better economic system than Socialism,"this is crucial to keep growing a stronger economy and helps goods become cheaper than they would be under a socialist government. my problems

in the United States.,"the assumption here is that competition keeps society moving, that it s what fuels scientific innovation and all. however, it does not. rather it halts innovation, and we get stuck with shitty versions of technology that could be. for example, part of the cause of the great depression was that goods in the us were being made too well. they lasted too long without needing replacement, so eventually, business halted and people lost their jobs, as a result, goods have to be produced more shittily to keep business up. under capitalism, production requires financial incentive. when there s no financial incentive, things aren t made. then there s imperialism, which is the only logical extension of capitalism. growing capitalism needs more and more markets. it s a self destructive system that will always either fall to shit and be replaced or heavily modified with government safety nets, and when it withstands crumbling of being overthrown, it s maintained through military means or extreme human rights violations. if a society with the technology and infrastructure of somewhere like the us were to transition to a socialist society, education would be far more accessible, as would food and housing empty houses outnumber homeless people here and society would function more efficiently because everyone would have adequate food and shelter, at the very least. then more people would be able to pursue medicine or astronomy or engineering and better society instead of having to work late night retail shifts for years.","the problem with socialism is that it's not a socialist system. it's a capitalist system. if you don't want to pay taxes, you're not going to be able to do anything. you're going to have to spend money to pay for things like

 The word god shouldn't be used if you can't define it as a being,"words, as always, change in meaning over time, they morph and adapt as people choose to use them. this facet of language is often abused in discussions. this is a reason why it's helpful to banish ambiguous words so that they're forced to be swapped by the full intention behind them instead of the words themselves. however, i'm not of the opinion that we should rely on the dictionary as the tool closing the deal for what the definitions are. i don't have anything against ambiguity and fluidity of meanings however my point is that when two persons want to convey meaning to one another they have to be on the same ground. so here's my point: there's a surging trend these days of calling yourself a believer in god but not being able to qualify it and not accepting any attribute that others want to associate with it. the only attributes those people claim are not really valid in my opinion. for example: god is the starting point of the universe though not agreeing on if he has a mind or not, or any of its will, or any criteria for that matter god is the universe itself same as above, this doesn't tell us anything about it a sort of pantheism but that isn't with a mind or will. from my view i think this is highly confusing. i would call this atheism but those persons would still refer to themselves as theists or deists because they've chosen to keep using the word god. in some cases those persons even adhere to a religion or at least follow a certain set of ways of living, a system of values related to it. maybe this is vague and those persons just don't want to offend anyone. this seems like a weak position to me. is it still a guide of life?

 The Term ‘LGBTQIA+’ is Actively Harmful Towards the Cause it Tries to Support Because it Drives Away Potential Supporters for Being...

Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law,"my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law : my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.",I think abortion should be 100% legal everywhere.,are miscarriages manslaughter?,"if you want to argue that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed, then you should be arguing that it is premated murder.","the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. the courts should recognize this.","what about the fact that people who don't want to have children don't have the means to do so? if a child is not a living thing, then why should the government pay for it? if the government pays for it, why shouldn't it pay for the child?"
" Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral","you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter? no matter how real it looks, it isn't . it may look uncomfortable to some people to see what looks like themselves in vulgar scenes, but just because something is uncomfortable to look at to some, does not mean it is inherently immoral. 2. you don't own the image of your face. every day you willingly give it away by walking in public or posting selfies of yourself online. this is especially true for celebrities. it's almost their job to make their appearance as widely known as possible. and even if you don't, you're not entitled to 'own' illustrations of yourself like a copyrighted piece of art anyway, at least not by default. it's human nature for people to remember how other people look and picture them in their heads, even in thoughts such as sexual fantasies. and if that's okay then i don't understand why it's not okay to just copy these thoughts into a tangible format such as an illustration. 3. technology is ever improving, and faked imagery is only going to get more realistic and easy to produce. i'm sure last century there were people equally offended by faked porn that would to our eyes look ridiculously bad and unrealistic. fakes are here to stay, and we need to adapt our sense of morality to reflect this reality. i believe this will happen and such images will get normalized sooner or later either way, but i think it would be in everyone's interest to just get it over with and make it sooner rather than later."," Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral : you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter?

 Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords.,"by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name? ' , then that is almost certainly easier to guess than it would be to guess their password. the overall security is reduced. instead of forcing password restrictions, users should have the freedom to choose a password as 'strong' or as 'weak' as they wish. inform the users when they are making their account how strong their passwords are, and give recommendations. but at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion. cmv!"," Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords. : by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name?

 I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue.,"i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you."," I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue. : i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you.",i don't think a woman should be able to have an abortion.,"if the girl lets the guy cum inside her or she wasn t too careful just like he probably wasn t, then surely if the guy wants to keep the child she should at least consider his thoughts and how he feels? girls have too much power and could possible crush a guys dreams because she has the right to do so",i think you're missing the point that the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible for their child's death is the fault of the parents. i think it's more important to understand that the parents are not responsible for the child's life. they are responsible for what happens to the child.,"i agree with you on the first point, but i don't think abortion is a women's rights issue. it's not a woman's right to determine whether or not she has a right to reproduce. i think there's a difference between abortion and rape.","i don't think it is a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. if you want to have sex with a woman, then you have to do it in a way that is safe for you to do."

 Diversity of beliefs and thoughts is way more important than diversity of identity,"it's a pretty simple one. few people complain about how the majority of young people and the media are liberal, and mostly circlejerk in echo chambers of opinions. now i will acknowledge sometimes identity automatically gives you a different viewpoint. for example, diversity matters when talking about islam, because a muslim can talk from experience. but i dont think having a muslim person in unrelated cases is worth anything just because they're muslim. in general, i'd rather have a board of 10 straight white males with all differing political stances and opinions than a board of black, white, men, women, and whatever else inbetween that all have leftist opinions. if that makes any sense. cmv."," Diversity of beliefs and thoughts is way more important than diversity of identity : it's a pretty simple one. few people complain about how the majority of young people and the media are liberal, and mostly circlejerk in echo chambers of opinions. now i will acknowledge sometimes identity automatically gives you a different viewpoint. for example, diversity matters when talking about islam, because a muslim can talk from experience. but i dont think having a muslim person in unrelated cases is worth anything just because they're muslim. in general, i'd rather have a board of 10 straight white males with all differing political stances and opinions than a board of black, white, men, women, and whatever else inbetween that all have leftist opinions. if that makes any sense. cmv.",I think diversity of thought is more important than diversity of people.,"i think diversity of perspectives and expertise is the most important thing. thinking about it in terms of my work as a scientist, i've found a lot of value in working with people with diverse training. i work in one area of biology that intersects with a lot of other fields, and i'd rather tackle most projects with a team of smart people that includes a math major and a chemistry major than three biology majors. i've worked with people from a variety of demographic backgrounds and i think about them primarily in terms of what they're good at doing; their race and sexuality are irrelevant. however, politically, all of these people range from center left to far left. i have never worked with a conservative professionally, because they either don't want to go into my field or don't make the cut. there is no ideological litmus test that stops conservatives from becoming scientists. they're not being persecuted. they just don't make it. part of the issue is that conservatism in the modern american form holds some very stupid ideas that repel intelligent people who have a wide range of life experiences. for example, anyone who goes to college for several years is likely to have at least a few gay friends and want them to be happily married if they so choose. it's hard for someone who knows several gays as normal people who want to live normal lives to be afraid of them getting married or see it as a threat; that view can come only from unfamiliarity and or fervent belief in a self contradictory book of ancient fables. conservatism is also closely associated with several anti science views and policy actions, including rejecting evolution and denying the existence of anthropogenic climate change. people intelligent enough to become scientists are very unlikely to hold those conservative views. likewise, scientists are likely to have traveled quite a bit for research and to conferences, and to have lived in several different places; all of these things provide some exposure to other cultures and reduce the fear of other cultures, or of mixing of cultures, that's implicit in mainstream conservative positions on issues like immigration. if you were to insist that teams of scientists must have political views proportional to those of the country at large basically affirmative action for political views you'd have to reach for completely unqualified people to fill the conservative spots, and they'd have nothing to do but sit around picking their noses. conservatism in general rarely imbues somebody with ideas that make them valuable for any task, and certainly not in the way a different measure of diversity of knowledge such as college major does. there is certainly a role for center right conservatives, or at least for centrists, in opposing the occasional excesses of the far left. i would like to see a reasonable, good faith opposition to the far left as a moderating force in our politics. but conservatives who fit that mould are pretty rare.","i don't know if i'm going to change your view, but i think you're underestimating the importance of diversity in our society.",i think diversity of beliefs and thoughts is way more important than diversity of identity,"i think diversity of thought is more important than diversity of opinions. i think there are a few reasons why diversity of thinking is important. firstly, diversity of ideas is important, but diversity of people is not the only thing that matters. as a muslim myself, i think it's important to have a diverse group of muslims in the board of directors. i don't think it matters if there's a board of 10 straight white men with all differing political stances and opinions. if there isn't, then there's no reason to think that diversity is the only way to achieve this. second, diversity is important because it means that you have a variety of viewpoints. for example, if you're a white man, you might have a lot of different views than a black man, but you might also have a bunch of white women. third, diversity means that there's more diversity in ideas and opinions than there is in any other field."

" the story of Job teaches no valuable lessons, other than God is a jerk.","by this i mean that the book doesn't contain any notable insights nor does it resolve any interesting theological questions, albeit i personally love it as a piece of absurdist fiction. worse than that, it seems to be undermining the very religion of whose holy text it belongs to. the book revolves a lot about theodicy; the problem of evil in the world. how can bad things happen to good people, and vice versa?

most people don't think so. most people consider it wrong to leave a baby in a trash can. the argument against this, that i can imagine, is that someone else can take care of the child after it is born after roughly 6 months of pregnancy. however, why is there a compelling interest to taking care of the child? most people don't want to adopt. why don't we just leave the orphans on the street to fend for themselves? overall, you always have a choice for everything. if i decide to cheat on my wife, that is my choice. if i decide to speed, it's my choice. if i decide to kill someone, that's my choice. the main argument is, is the fetus human alive, is killing something that is human alive wrong? personally i'm fine with killing things. i eat meat, i'm fine with kill shelters, with animal testing etc. however, i value human life. there is a religious reason i have for valuing human life. i believe that humans are made in god's image and that other animals are given to us, with our dominion over them. we shouldn't kill animals recklessly because we have dominion, but it is amoral whether or not an animal dies. however, i think it is moral whether or not a human is killed or not. if you are not religious, then according to the atheistic logic that makes sense to me, you get to define what is right and wrong. so you decide if human lives are moral or not, whether animal lives are moral or not, whether plant lives are moral or not. if you aren't deciding for yourself, then you are deciding from a relativist cultural standpoint i'm assuming you aren't, but i'll cover it just in case . if this is the case, then it is legally acceptable in america and it is something that is hidden. don't ask, don't tell. you only risk cultural shame by mentioning it which is why i'm assuming you aren't talking about relativism .","i don't think you can argue that abortion is a slippery slope, but i think you're using the word slippery slope in a way that doesn't really make sense. if a woman is pregnant, she can't force her parents to give her their kidneys. if she's pregnant, it's not the same as forcing her to give up her kidneys.","you're right that abortion is a slippery slope, but that doesn't mean you're pro choice.","i think you're missing the point of abortion. if you're a woman who wants to get a kidney, then you should be able to get an abortion. you can't force a woman to give up her right to have an abortion, but you can force a man to give her his right to her body. if a woman wants to have a baby, she should be allowed to do so. if she wants to be a mother, then she should have the right to choose whether she wants an abortion or not."

lip service to social issues and being center to center right on foreign policy, wall street regulations, and especially on issues regarding all the money swirling around congress. the hot topic right now is how radical mainstream democrats are and how scary and new that is. mainstream democrats have been moving to the right for decades to appeal to moderates and to pad their pocketbooks, and only recently have started to shift back left when they finally started to realize the were losing more of their base than was being gained in new moderate voters. this isn't new, it's a return to a compromise second approach rather than compromise first, and is more aligned with the largest portions of their base. my point is, i'm still an independent progressive. i could have called myself a member of the democratic party the whole time and been more right than wrong on sheer percentage. hell, i'm probably 70 80 aligned at this point in the shift, at least with the rhetoric, and that's pretty damn high. but i'm not choosing a team, i'm not leaving myself open to be burned by another tactical shift, and most importantly i'm not raising money for the dnc to hoard it away or pay it out to candidates the people don't want. no, i will vote based on the policies that the men and women running align themselves with, and when that means i'm voting republican very rare, best example i have is the mayor of my town after years of a corrupt democrat or independent or third party unless it's the general election for president, i'm not interested in lighting that particular vote on fire

a benign accomplice to all the ideas republicans espouse. even if that isn't 100 accurate, nobody sees you fighting the monster from within, debating republicans on conservatism, fighting republicans

' incel before 'incel' was really a buzzword. like an incel, he was lonely. like an incel, he felt 'entitled' to a woman. like an incel, he saw fit to punish that woman for being with someone else, even though that woman didn't know he existed. and like an incel, he was very depressed and unhappy with life in general. and like many incels, he eventually ended up killing himself. and what happened? he wasn't seen as some piece of shit like minassian was. bj rk even mourned his passing. because she and many others understood that what he was doing was not acceptable, but his mind was too far gone for him to just stop doing it. amp; x200b; and it wasn't just cho or lopez or aghdam or the columbine kids. there's stack, there's huberty, there's a whole long list of them, who commit extreme unjustified acts, but somehow we're able to see the tortured existence inside. not being able to date bj rk is no reason to actively try and mutilate her. just like not having had sex is no reason to call for the enslavement of all women. but for lopez we understand that while his reasons are unjustified, something's wrong in his head that turns his loneliness into a reason to kill. so why can't we see that in minassian, or rodger, or the many other incels out there? and in aghdam's case, only just slightly before. how did our attitude towards mental health change so drastically between aghdam and minassian?",Incels are suffering from mental illness and should be helped,"when you say 'mental health issues,' are you thinking of any specific disorders? unless you name some depression, schizophrenia, etc or give some guidelines for what counts as mentally ill e. g. obsessing over something to the point that it causes self harm , i think calling someone 'mentally ill' is subjective and can't be debated very well. for example, some extremely religious people think that atheists are mentally ill but that's not a view that most other people would agree with. simply googling 'what is mentally ill' showed me a lot of debate on the topic. here's one of the article","i agree with you that incels are selfish assholes, but i don't think that's the whole point of them. i think it's important to understand that they're not a selfish asshole, they're just people who want to be treated as a human being.","incels are suffering from mental health issues, but are being held to a double standard compared to other people who suffer from the same mental illness.",i don't think incels are suffering from mental illness and should be helped.
" The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason.","a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident."," The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason. : a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident.","I believe that a senate that is elected in this waywarts the will of the people,",the senate was specifically designed to give each state equal representation in the federal government in spite of population differences. the whole point is california can't bully wyoming into doing what it wants.,"the problem with this is that the majority of the states do not have the power to decide what is best for the country. in fact, a majority of states have the ability to make decisions based on the will of the people. this is because the people of the united states are more likely to make a decision based on their own interests than on the whims of the individual states.",the senate is a powerful body. it has the power to decide who gets confirmed and who gets rejected. the senate is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident.,i don't see how this is going to change the will of the people. it would be better if there was a senate that was elected in this way instead of a house of representatives.
 CEO salaries should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker,"this provides a powerful incentive to a ceo to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. the downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low skill workers, with ceos making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage."," CEO salaries should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker : this provides a powerful incentive to a ceo to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. the downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low skill workers, with ceos making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage.",Companies could use a UBI as a justification to offer lower wages.,"first of all, such a thing will immediately result in companies contracting out all the low paying duties. the ceo of a tech company is not going to be held back because the company employs one minimum wage parking lot attendant. hr will be contracted out too. only the employees driving the core revenue of the corporation would remain. now after all the support jobs are contracted out, let's look at two companies. one is the company that was contracted for the low end services of the first company. it's a big company contracting these services to lots of others. say it has 50,000 employees. you have a ceo managing a 50,000 person company and his salary is based on minimum wage. now let's look to that engineering company that contracted out its support jobs. all that's left is a few hundred engineers and managers, and the lowest paid person there makes 60,000 a year. this ceo of a small company is allowed to make over twice the salary of the ceo of the huge company. does that make sense? , finish this off. so now you're a talented ceo type and are looking for a job. you look at these two companies, and of course you're going to go for the engineering company since you can make more money. this will be happening across the nation, so in the end the most talented ceos will be running the high paid companies, and the companies employing most of the minimum wage workers will be run by the less talented ceos. do you think that is a good situation?","i don't think it's fair to say that ceos make less than minimum wage, but i think it is fair to assume that they make more than minimum wages. i don't see how this is fair.","i don't know what you're talking about, but i think it's worth considering. i don't think ceo salaries should be tied to the wages of their lowest paid worker. if they make 1000x minimum wage, then they should be able to increase the value of their company as it'll improve their stock value.",what if a ceo makes less than 1000x minimum wage?

" Cultural Appropriation is largely misidentified, and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis","some background: i'm a cis, white, liberal woman. this particular opinion i hold is one that tends to clash with the general belief systems of many of the communities and political sects that i consider myself a part of, and that's why i'm coming here to hopefully gain insight into aspects of this phenomenon that i, as a white person, may not realize or understand. i feel like an example scenario may be the best way to explain what i mean, so here we go: jenny is a 16 year old white girl. she lives and goes to school in an area that has a fairly equal population of black people and white people. she has seen black girls online and in school that wear box braids, and she thinks they're beautiful. she regularly compliments all kinds of women on all kinds of hairstyles that she thinks are pretty, and gets inspiration from them all the time. eventually, she decides to go get box braids for herself. she posts a picture on social media and some guy named richard comments 'so hawt! ! ' or something. a look back through richard's post history shows that a week ago he made a post disparaging natural hair hairstyles, calling them 'ghetto', 'trashy', 'ugly', what have you. as annoying sounding a term as it is, i truly do believe that 'cultural appreciation' is a genuine thing although i hate saying it because i feel like it has the same connotation as 'all lives matter' or some shit . anyway, my point here is that jenny loved a certain hairstyle, and acted out of nothing but admiration and respect. had she been the one to previously condemn such a hairstyle when worn by a black woman but gone on to decide that it was 'okay' if she did it, then she certainly would be guilty of ca. in this instance, the only person at fault is richard, who also didn't commit ca, but was absolutely a massively problematic bigot. regardless of whether jenny's hairstyle was what incited richard's hypocrisy, she is not the one responsible for his skewed stances or more accurately, the larger societal views that he represents in this situation . basically: there's no doubt that in many instances, society vilifies an aspect of a certain culture simply for the association with said culture, but then glorifies it when it presents itself among 'white culture'. this is absolutely problematic, but attacking well meaning individuals is the wrong way to deal with it."," Cultural Appropriation is largely misidentified, and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis : some background: i'm a cis, white, liberal woman. this particular opinion i hold is one that tends to clash with the general belief systems of many of the communities and political sects that i consider myself a part of, and that's why i'm coming here to hopefully gain insight into aspects of this phenomenon that i, as a white person, may not realize or understand. i feel like an example scenario may be the best way to explain what i mean, so here we go: jenny is a 16 year old white girl. she lives and goes to school in an area that has a fairly equal population of black people and white people. she has seen black girls online and in school that wear box braids, and she thinks they're beautiful. she regularly compliments all kinds of women on all kinds of hairstyles that she thinks are pretty, and gets inspiration from them all the time. eventually, she decides to go get box braids for herself. she posts a picture on social media and some guy named richard comments 'so hawt! !

" Animals should not have rights, animal cruelty (especially if it's necessary for scientific reasons) is fine and vegetarianism/ veganism is pointless.","first of all, i don't think that there are such things as natural rights not even for humans rather rights are derived from morality which i think has no natural basis like a god i'm an atheist other than basic empathy and that it just sometimes feels good to do 'good stuff' which feelings have evolutionary origins. so there is no such thing as one true morality. my philosophy is 'don't die and do whatever the fuck you feel like doing' and that we should construct our morality around this statement. so there is no logical reason to give animals rights because rights are defined by humans and giving animals rights doesn't help us to survive and usually makes doing things that we feel like doing a lot harder or impossible. for example eating meat, because you like the taste of meat; or experimenting on live animals to invent things, or just simply to satisfy your scientific curiosity; and if for some reason you like torturing animals, although i don't advocate it, i don't see any reason why you shouldn't as long as that animal isn't someone else's property . about veganism: i don't think we should ban it or anything like that, since as i said if you feel like doing something you should do it, but it is just plain stupid. the problem with this argument is that it can seemingly easily be extended to humans leading to the conclusion that murder and theft are okay. however looking at history we see that quality of life and life expectancy have greatly increased since society formed, therefore forming a society and working together is the most efficient way to 'survive' and by being willing to give up doing some things that we 'feel like doing' like murfer theft or anything that would make society disfunctional we enable ourselves to do so much more . therefore we must shape our morality and law that makes for the most efficient and freest society. because of the social contract: contract giving every human equal rights is the most optimal way to go. to prevent rebellions and such however recklessly sticking to our current morality and not thinking thinks through logically with cold strict reasoning thwarts advancement. for historical examples see slavery because of racism;

 America has an obesity problem because healthy food is way too expensive,"sugary, fatty food is so much cheaper then healthier meals. think about it, look at any grocery store. fresh, lean meats and fresh vegetables especially organic are ungodly expensive. meanwhile, you can get sweets, prepackaged food and processed food for only a couple bucks. think about it, being a very poor person or maybe someone who recieves snap benefits, with very little money to spend on food has to ration their money and make it last a month. seriously, have you ever noticed that in general it's usually poorer people who are overweight and more wealthy people are thinner another good example is mcdonald's and other fast food places. it's a quick solution for people who have very little time to cook, but you can buy a burger for literally 1 dollar. the grilled chicken sandwich costs around 5, and a salad costs about 6 or 7. it may not seem like much, but it adds up. a lot. now there is some personal choice involved, but still, there's really no healthy options for people who can't afford to buy fresh healthy food on a regular basis. this is all my opinion, because i went through something similar when i was between jobs. but i am willing to listen to opposing opinions"," America has an obesity problem because healthy food is way too expensive : sugary, fatty food is so much cheaper then healthier meals. think about it, look at any grocery store. fresh, lean meats and fresh vegetables especially organic are ungodly expensive. meanwhile, you can get sweets, prepackaged food and processed food for only a couple bucks. think about it, being a very poor person or maybe someone who recieves snap benefits, with very little money to spend on food has to ration their money and make it last a month. seriously, have you ever noticed that in general it's usually poorer people who are overweight and more wealthy people are thinner another good example is mcdonald's and other fast food places. it's a quick solution for people who have very little time to cook, but you can buy a burger for literally 1 dollar. the grilled chicken sandwich costs around 5, and a salad costs about 6 or 7. it may not seem like much, but it adds up. a lot. now there is some personal choice involved, but still, there's really no healthy options for people who can't afford to buy fresh healthy food on a regular basis. this is all my opinion, because i went through something similar when i was between jobs. but i am willing to listen to opposing opinions",food is for rich people and not for poor people,"there are a few things i want to mention. 1. you can still be obese eating nothing but healthy food, excess is excess. 2. healthy food isn't necessarily that expensive, or even more expensive than unhealthy food. most fruits and vegetables are incredibly cheap. 3. eating unhealthy food in moderation will not lead to obesity source: lost 34 lbs. on a mostly fast food diet kept lt;2,000 kcal day with exercise . 4. 'healthy' options at a lot of restaurants, namely salads and similar, are not at all healthy and often worse than the regular menu options, like burgers, at least in terms of raw calorie content. obesity, for the vast majority of people, is and always has been from consuming far more calories than you burn. you can do this with healthy food, you can do this with unhealthy food, healthy food can be cheap or pricey, unhealthy food can be cheap or pricey. all it takes to avoid obesity is self control, regulating calorie intake to be less than or equal to what you burn. i don't even think convenience is that great of an excuse. i can order two jr. chickens for 4 cad, and that's 740 kcal. perfectly adequate as a meal in terms of calories at least , and very convenient. i don't have to get the quarter pounder w cheese with upsize fries and coke for 1,390 kcal.","i don't know about you, but i'm going to try to change your view. i think you're looking at a lot of things wrong with your view, and i'm not sure what you're trying to change. i'm just going to point out that you seem to be looking at the argument from a different angle. it seems to me that the argument you're making is based on the assumption that people who can afford to buy healthy food are more likely to buy unhealthy food. that's not the case. if you can't afford healthy food, then you're probably going to end up with unhealthy food that you don't want to eat.","i don't think there is an obesity problem in the united states, but there is a problem in america. the problem is that there is not enough food in the world to sustain a healthy lifestyle. it's not that there isn't food, it's that there are too many options. there are plenty of people who don't have the money to buy healthy food, but they can't afford to buy it because they don't want to eat it. for example, if you're going to go to mcdonald's, you'll have to buy a burger for literally 1 dollar. if you are going to eat a burger at mcdonalds, you will have to pay for it.","i think you're missing the point of the argument. food is cheap. it's cheaper to buy healthy food than it is to buy unhealthy food. if you're poor, you're much less likely to eat healthy food."

 It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa,"high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives."," It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa : high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives.",I believe that iq is a stupid measure of intelligence.,"i think that if you join any kind of society for the express purpose of being able to brag about your eligibility, you probably have some insecurity to work through but this is hardly unique to members of mensa. another example that comes to mind is paying to be listed in who's who directories and the like. on the other hand, there are people who join societies like this because they enjoy the activities and social programs therein. many older people in particular, who may be lonely, might look for any kind of group or society they are eligible to join. i've never heard a bragging word leave my elderly neighbor's mouth, but she goes to mensa meetings every week because she likes to simultaneously have human interaction and keep her mind sharp by doing brain games with other people who enjoy them. anytime she mentions mensa, it's usually because she want to share a cool puzzle she got there. in brief: if your motive for joining mensa is to brag, then you have issues with insecurity. but that is not the only reason people join mensa. so i think that to say the organization itself is stupid because a certain subset of its members join only for status is not a tenable argument. societal attitudes toward praising intelligence or other heritable traits is a separate issue entirely, of which certain individuals' mensa membership is at most a byproduct.","iq is not a measure of intelligence. iq is a way to measure intelligence. if you are intelligent, you are likely to have a high iq. but if you aren't intelligent, then you are probably not going to be able to do the things you want to do.","i think it's stupid to join a high iq society. i don't know if you're talking about a society with a low iq, but i think you're referring to a society that only allows members with a certain iq percentile. iq is not an indicator of intelligence, it's a measure of social skills. it is a measurement of how well you interact with others.",i don't think it's stupid to think that iq is a stupid measure of intelligence.

 (Theoretical) physics is no longer beneficial and should be defunded,"in past eras, advanced physics helped humanity develop by explaining the world around us. it helped us understand orbits, advance our knowledge of how atoms function, leading to developments in many fields, and enable our technology to take advantage of more mechanics of the universe than before. however, recently the amount of useful results to come out of the physics field seems to have dwindled. now, most of what is produced seems to deal with highly conceptual research, such as string theory and quantum gravity. other avenues of research, such as particle physics research, produce information with little to no practical uses for humanity. the large hadron collider alone cost 4. 75 billion, and annually requiring approximately 1 billion to continue operation. although the collider was instrumental in proving the existence of the higgs boson, the particle has no uses. other experiments involve not investigating anything new at all, merely proving and re proving what we already know about relativity and its related research. instead of continuing to pour money into a field which has extremely limited benefits, i believe funding should be taken out of the physics field and used to solve real problems in the world. the money used to build the lhc could have been used for things like feeding the poor, fixing the education system, or advancing medicine. if the lhc's annual budget was taken away, there would be an extra 1 billion dollars every year dedicated to solving tangible real world problems."," (Theoretical) physics is no longer beneficial and should be defunded : in past eras, advanced physics helped humanity develop by explaining the world around us. it helped us understand

something that happens naturally because it's impossible to keep up with everything that goes on in the world. work on new subatomic models could all potentially be applied directly to things like the quantum computer, which would drastically reduce latency between computer connections. physicists are working on breakthroughs in the field of solid state matter, which in the future will be applied to more efficient energy storage. others are working on breakthroughs in nuclear fusion. which will be applied to greener safer energy. the thing with physics is that the benefits aren't felt immediately. that's why people aren't as aware of the practical applications. physicists lay out the roadmap for engineers to develop a practical product. this has been true throughout all of history. when jj thompson discovered the electron, he had no idea what the implications would be. we currently live in a world that is ruled by the electron.","the lhc has been funded by the federal government for over a decade, and the money has been used for research that has been ongoing for decades. it's a very small amount of money, but it's an enormous amount. it can be used for a lot of things, and

 The left is more fascist than the right in America.,"contrary to what reddit would have you believe fascism doesn't 'racist' or 'far right'. fascism just means gt; a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power,forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc so there's three main components of fascism. 1. government has complete power 2. they forcibly suppress opposition 3. they regiment industry and commerce so let's start with 1. trump's administration is deregulating at an incredible rate and deregulation is one of the core republican policies. positions of the republican party deregulation significantly decreases both the size and power of a government. now number 2. forcibly suppressing opposition doesn't necessarily have to be done through murder. censorship is also extremely effective at this. this is made evident from the widespread censorship of conservative view points from all major social networks. you could make the argument that the left only calls for censorship of speech that incites violence. the right has fewer circumstances in which they believe their opposition must be censored. you could also argue that these are private companies completely within their rights to not give a platform to anybody for whatever reason. but that situation is very comparable to when street owners tried to censor demonstrations from people they didn't agree with politically. this was dangerous because the street owners had an oligarchy on the means of free speech. they could censor any idea they disagreed with. this is a perfect comparison for social networks today, with one judge going as far as to say gt;

' 3. i'm not really sure what work 'regiment' is doing in your definition, but this is the part that seems to least relevant to fascism. economic interventionism, the left most certainly is. but that does not make them any more or any less fascist than the right. amp; x200b;","i think you're misinterpreting the definition of fascism. fascism is a government that has complete power, but it's also a government with complete power.","the left is more fascist than the right in a lot of ways. i think you're underestimating the extent to which the left is a fascist. it's not that the left isn't fascist, it's that the right isn't a fascist at all.","i think you're misunderstanding the definition of fascism. the term is used to describe a government that has complete power. it's a government which has complete control over the economy. the government does not control the economy, it controls the media, and it is the government that regulates the media. it is also the government which controls the internet. it does not regulate the media or the internet, it regulates the communication of information. this is a government with complete power, and the media is controlled by the government. the media has a monopoly on information, and that monopoly is the only way to regulate information. it doesn't have to be regulated by government, it has to be controlled by private companies, and if you want to censor information, you can do so through private companies. if you don't want to do that, you're going to have to do it through private corporations, which means you have to deal with private corporations."
" Attaining biological immortality would not be good for the human species and, ultimately, is a selfish idea.","firstly, this post is inspired and essentially a response to the following two videos by youtuber cgp grey: typically, i love content from this channel, but i find myself vehemently disagreeing with the simplicity of his view about the function of death as a part of life. the following are reasons why i believe death needs to happen. the idea that suddenly everyone will be immune to death, and that the last person will die forever is preposterous. this would cause widespread issues including backlash from those whos religion does not agree with immortality, for example panic, and most likely a desperate struggle for people to gain access to this 'death cure'. the presence of a death cure itself would cause a great deal of chaos, and even if the chaos ends one day, there will be other issues that arise 2: having a world where old ideas, practices, beliefs, and ideologies remain with the people who hold them sounds awful. the way things are now, new people are being born every day bringing new points of view, movements, and ideas forward. with new generations comes innovation and change. think of some of the points of view or ideologies held by people as early as 20 years ago. now think about 50 years ago. 100 years? the world we live in has drastically changed with our new ideas. for this reason the cycling of human life is necessary. those who are old overwhelmingly tend to become stuck in their ways, believing that their longevity makes their points of view valid. curing a death will either put a halt to this change, or slow it dramatically due to the need to control our population. 3: having a cure for death would require us to impose extreme controls on our population. currently, our population is growing at an alarming rate, while the condition of our planet deteriorates. if we find a death cure, and continue to grow in the same way, we will very quickly outgrow our means for sustaining ourselves. the solution to this problem would be imposing extreme controls on who can breed and when. these things would need to be monitored, and rules would need to be enforced. i don't think i need to describe the dystopian future that this would create. the idea of even being able to successfully control the breeding of 7 billion people is extremely difficult. rather than keeping one organism alive for a potential eternity, it is far easier to have that organism breed, multiply, and have their offspring do the same. this allows for the spreading favorable traits, creating new and better version of each organism. 5: with an eternity to live, inevitably you will get bored. sooner or later in an infinite time span you will no longer be able to find joy in what mortal life might have to offer. when you've seen an done everything over an infinite amount of time, you'll eventually decide it's time to check out anyway. this isn't inherently bad, a desire to live is necessary for life to carry on. cmv currently my comments aren't coming through properly are being tacked on to the wrong posts. i will reply to comments as soon as i can."," Attaining biological immortality would not be good for the human species and, ultimately, is a selfish idea. : firstly, this post is inspired and essentially a response to the following two videos by youtuber cgp grey: typically, i love content from this channel, but i find myself vehemently disagreeing with the simplicity of his view about the function of death as a part of life. the following are reasons why i believe death needs to happen. the idea that suddenly everyone will be immune to death, and that the last person will die forever is preposterous. this would cause widespread issues including backlash from those whos religion does not agree with immortality, for example panic, and most likely a desperate struggle for people to gain access to this 'death cure'. the presence of a death cure itself would cause a great deal of chaos, and even if the chaos ends one day, there will be other issues that arise 2: having a world where old ideas, practices, beliefs, and ideologies remain with the people who hold them sounds awful. the way things are now, new people are being born every day bringing new points of view, movements, and ideas forward. with new generations comes innovation and change. think of some of the points of view or ideologies held by people as early as 20 years ago. now think about 50 years ago. 100 years?

 Not everyone should be allowed to have children,"the three main bases of assessment would be: 1 financial economic, 2 psychologically, 3 criminal history. 1. economically financially: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to provide for the child's basic needs housing, food, reasonable estimate of healthcare etc. , and education at least through high school . this would be based on a holistic assessment of the person's and or couple's current income both active and passive , earning potential, availability of fairly liquid capital; the total earning potential should be able to cover the benchmarked costs for the above mentioned necessities without incurring excess debt i haven't calculated exactly what that'd be, but it'd be leveraging themselves up to a certain percentage of their current income 2. psychologically: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they pass a psychological evaluation that deems them fit to be parenting. i haven't completed figured out what the guidelines would be yet, but it would basically have to demonstrate that the person or couple doesn't have any severe mental disorders nor a recurring history of disorders . 3. criminal history: the person or couple cannot have a lengthy or recurring history of criminal activities this would be based on a has a lengthy history of criminal offenses;

were always loaded, to know my target and what's beyond, to never point a firearm at anything i'm not willing to shoot, to lock up my guns, and to keep my finger off the trigger and the trigger guard.

refuses to vote for a democrat that's pro gun control,"here's the official position of the dnc, as stated in the 2016 democratic platform preventing gun violence with 33,000 americans dying every year, democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence. while responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in america have suffered from gun violence. we can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. to build on the success of the lifesaving brady handgun violence prevention act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy; and keep weapons of war such as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines lcam's off our streets. we will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. there is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue. what part of this troubles you enough to vote for someone from a different party? note that in these modern times, the 4th amendment is much more important than the 2nd amendment in securing our freedom from tyranny. however, i appreciate that some people are in situations where they need guns

Most recreational drugs should be legalised.,"the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why? well when any society attempts to control the consumption of any substance by banning it, we get black markets. that is essentially all strict drug laws do, they create a black market. that black market fuels organised crime and demonises certain persons from society. my second reason, is that if you legalise certain drugs people are consuming anyway you remove the taboo of them seeking help if they become addicted. as it currently stands there is help for those who want to quit smoking tobacco or quit consuming alcohol. these drugs are arguably far worse than most other substances available on the black market. my last reason is i fully believe that a lot of people can take other substances responsibly, in the same way one consumes alcohol. not every user is an addict. i think we need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable. i welcome any counter arguments here, in which may change my view.","Most recreational drugs should be legalised. : the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why? well when any society attempts to control the consumption of any substance by banning it, we get black markets. that is essentially all strict drug laws do, they create a black market. that black market fuels organised crime and demonises certain persons from society. my second reason, is that if you legalise certain drugs people are consuming anyway you remove the taboo of them seeking help if they become addicted. as it currently stands there is help for those who want to quit smoking tobacco or quit consuming alcohol. these drugs are arguably far worse than most other substances available on the black market. my last reason is i fully believe that a lot of people can take other substances responsibly, in the same way one consumes alcohol. not every user is an addict. i think we need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable. i welcome any counter arguments here, in which may change my view.",I believe all drugs should be legalised.,"i would say yes, ideally most recreational substances would be legal, however, each place has different histories with recreational substances, different laws, different societal beliefs, that would significantly impact the way they would be received. in a significantly religious state, there may be more of a backlash, people may interpret the state supporting the legalisation as a move against the grain or the tenets of the major religion. a state with a significant drug problem, may abuse the legalisation of such substances and temporarily regress into a self indulgent binge, while states with less prominent social problems may be relatively unchanged by the move, with those that partake in recreational consumption of drugs no longer threatened hindered by the laws that previously restricted use and possession. really subjective, no one knows what will happen. while some countries have had notable success in the legalisation of some or all substances, in conjunction with controls against the production, acquisition and resale or substances, this is not necessarily the result other countries would experience. whatever countries decide to do is a risk. countries that permit more freedom in regards to all aspects of illicit substances are taking a significant risk. whether a given country is willing to take on such a risk is subject to so many variables that are beyond the bounds of discussion of this post.",i don't think you need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable.,"the problem with your view is that it's not a good idea to ban recreational drugs because they're harmful to the health of the person taking them. it's a bad idea to allow people to get addicted to drugs because you want to prevent them from getting addicted to them. the problem isn't with the legalisation of drugs, it's with the prohibition of drugs. you can't outlaw drugs if you don't want to. the issue is that if you legalize recreational drugs, you're going to end up with a lot of people who want to use them, and you're also going to create a black market.",what do you mean by 'legalisation'?
" Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance.","let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k. 's claims that he did not fully understand how much power he wielded over these individuals because of his celebrity. to his cr, in every one of these instances, c. k. did ask before committing these acts. these instances seemed to happen at the time when his career was first starting to really flourish. i take him for his word when he said he didn t understand how, in his newly found celebrity, asking wasn t really asking. that is in no way an excuse for what c. k. did because his behavior was still wildly inappropriate, but i am still somewhat sympathetic to his explanation, which leads into my third point 3 lack of predatory nature: louis c. k. made bad judgments, but his behavior does not seem predatory to me the same way cosby's, spacey's, and weinstein s were. he never threatened to ruin a woman's career for not allowing him to expose himself in front of them, and based on the information we currently have, it seems as if this behavior stopped at some point. now, it is alleged that c. k. s agent david becky may have made vague threats on louis' behalf to the women who accused him, but i don't think that is enough to put that blame on louis. it is possible becky was acting without c. k. s knowledge. furthermore, when the ny times article was published, i found louis c. k. 's response to be a no bs acknowledgement of both the accusations and the hurt he caused. i think we have to give c. k. crfor that. 5 a learning moment: undoubtedly, the importance of metoo is that it finally gives victims of sexual assault a voice. but perhaps also we should hear from truly contrite men who have behaved inappropriately in the past to understand their reasoning and learn from their thoughts and regrets. i don t believe we should give predatory monsters like cosby, spacey, and weinstein a voice to explain their actions. it may be too soon for c. k. to make a comeback , but i think some day he should be allowed to."," Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance. : let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k.

 I believe nudity should not be illegal,"so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic."," I believe nudity should not be illegal : so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic.",I believe that public nudity should be completely legal.,"honestly my first thought, what if ladies leave snail trails on park benches and weird dudes with boners get their pre on stuff that we'll all touch? it's a fucked up idea but cmon i'm thinking if you let people be naked in a place like nyc, there would be way too much weird fucking shit going on man.","i think it's important to note that this isn't a new issue, it's just a new one. in the united states, we have a lot of laws against public nudity, but that's just the way it is in the us. we don't have laws against private nudity, we just have laws about public nudity.","i don't think you should be able to say that nudity should not be illegal because it's not something that should be illegal. if you can't say that you shouldn't be allowed to wear clothes, then why should you have to?","i don't think it should be illegal to be naked in public, but i think it shouldn't be legal to be nude in public."

work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on subjects of mental health and happiness because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. this is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. and teaching the foundations of that science to students as they live with emotional responses as a constant and resonating force in their own minds and as they interact with others in any all situation s could very likely improve productivity and senses of fulfillment and belonging for millions of people and generations to come. i should also note that saying 'math and english' was not specific. i was just bringing up two

 The US needs a Constitutional Convention,"hopefully this isn't too common a topic on cmv; the last post to put it this way was 2 years ago and more recent ones were more narrowly defined and are nearly a year old themselves . it had a great run it's the oldest constitution in continuous use, but most modern constitutions are written to be updated more frequently and actually are. ours is only really updated by supreme court decisions, with only 2 amendments being ratified in the last 50 years one of which was first proposed in 1789! til . the founders could not have imagined the world we live in today or its challenges, and the document is written as such. flawed solutions like the electoral college were created to solve problems of the 18th century that are irrelevant in the 21st. the founding fathers saw tyrannical government as the biggest threats to the rights of individuals, and wrote the constitution to protect those rights. that was logical in their day, but that is not the threat that those of us in modern democracies face. tyrannical companies taking from an article that's currently on the front page are the primary threat to individual rights and freedoms, and our government and constitution is not equipped to deal with that threat. i'm sure i'll get into more specific critiques in the comments, but that buildup of history and precedent makes justice incredibly difficult to come by in many instances and needs revision. if you haven't, i'd urge you to read the text. it takes like 20 minutes for the main text; probably 40 60 with amendments and is available everywhere. one of the main arguments that will likely be raised that will not change my view is the political will difficulty argument. i know it would be hard or impossible to make happen, especially given current politics."," The US needs a Constitutional Convention : hopefully this isn't too common a topic on cmv; the last post to put it this way was 2 years ago and more recent ones were more narrowly defined and are nearly a year old themselves . it had a great run it's the oldest constitution in continuous use, but most modern constitutions are written to be updated more frequently and actually are. ours is only really updated by supreme court decisions, with only 2 amendments being ratified in the last 50 years one of which was first proposed in 1789! til . the founders could not have imagined the world we live in today or its challenges, and the document is written as such. flawed solutions like the electoral college were created to solve problems of the 18th century that are irrelevant in the 21st. the founding fathers saw tyrannical government as the biggest threats to the rights of individuals, and wrote the constitution to protect those rights. that was logical in their day, but that is not the threat that those of us in modern democracies face. tyrannical companies taking from an article that's currently on the front page are the primary threat to individual rights and freedoms, and our government and constitution is not equipped to deal with that threat. i'm sure i'll get into more specific critiques in the comments, but that buildup of history and precedent makes justice incredibly difficult to come by in many instances and needs revision. if you haven't, i'd urge you to read the text. it takes like 20 minutes for the main text; probably 40 60 with amendments and is available everywhere. one of the main arguments that will likely be raised that will not change my view is the political will difficulty argument. i know it would be hard or impossible to make happen, especially given current politics.",we should amend the constitution to reflect the modern world,there is a legal process for corporations attacking your personal freedoms. and the reason as to why the government is so restrictive might be because of the preventions of abuse. you will always have an advocate and a watchdog if the government holds checks and balances as well as consistent preventions of abuse. overhauling the constitution specifically to be anti business by premise will send the country into an indefinite dark age. if you have grievances with corporations use the courts to make constitutional amendments proving that corporations are anti freedom in nuisance ways.,"the constitution was written to protect individual rights and freedoms. it was written by the founders to protect the rights of individuals, not the constitution itself.",the constitution was written to protect the rights of individuals. it was written by the founders to protect those rights.,"the constitution is not written to reflect the modern world. it is written to represent the current state of america. the founding fathers wrote the constitution to protect individuals from tyrannical government, and to protect the rights of the people. the constitution was written to protect individual rights and freedoms. it was written as a way to protect those rights."
Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law,"my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law : my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.",I think abortion should be 100% legal everywhere.,"sorry, u asianviolinist98 your submission has been removed for breaking rule b: you must personally hold the view and demonstrate that you are open to it changing . a post cannot be on behalf of others, playing devil's advocate, or 'soapboxing'. see the wiki page for more information if you would like to appeal, message the moderators by clicking this link please note that multiple violations will lead to a ban, as explained in our moderation standards","i think the problem with your argument is that it's based on the assumption that the fetus is not a living thing. the argument that abortion is premated murder is based on a false assumption that it is not. that is not the case. there is no way that a fetus can be born alive. the only way to prove this is to prove that it isn't alive. if it is, then the government shouldn't pay for it.",i think it's important to recognize that abortion is not premated murder. it's the responsibility of the mother to make sure the child is safe. the mother does not have the right to force the child to have sex with another man.,i don't think it's a good idea to ban abortion because it is premated murder.
 Racial information should be removed from college and job applications.,"i think it's absurd that it's done and it's not equal opportunity. people say by doing this that you're benefiting white people but i'm not sure how that's true. the argument can be made on financial assistance with how much money they're are assisted with based on race, however that should be determined after the applicant is accepted."," Racial information should be removed from college and job applications. : i think it's absurd that it's done and it's not equal opportunity. people say by doing this that you're benefiting white people but i'm not sure how that's true. the argument can be made on financial assistance with how much money they're are assisted with based on race, however that should be determined after the applicant is accepted.",I think affirmative action is wrong and should be abolished.,i have 2 point. 1 is that it's used as a statistical tool. where they want to know how many of a specific race or gender is applied or attending so that info can be used for various things. one thing that info is used for is to make sure that an equal opportunity is presented for all. like a collage that leans toward accepting students of a particular race. this information would make it harder for schools to selectively pick from highschool's using the methodology that you can dertermine within reasonablity a persons race economic level from the school they went to that have a higher chance of giving them a student of a race economic level that they want. 2 it is used for pr. one of the main things that collages love to talk about is how diverse they are. to avoid the 'then they are picking them for there race' argument that could stem from that line of thinking it would be best to put it in terms of value to the other students. a student who can bring in firsthand knowledge of another culture and share that knowledge with other students would be more beneficial to the school to have them enrolled there. colleges are a business first so it makes sense for them to do what helps them the most.,i don't think it's absurd that it's done and it's not equal opportunity. i think it is absurd that they are doing it because they're benefiting white people.,"it's not about race, it's about how the applicant is going to be treated. it's a matter of how they are treated. a lot of white people are treated differently than black people.",what do you mean by 'equal opportunity'? i think affirmative action is wrong and should be abolished. i think it's absurd that it's done and it's not equal opportunity.
 A joint account with a percentage-of-income (with a few other considerations) is the best way to split money,"i know this can have a lot of exceptions. please don't make your arguments about pointing out 2 or 3 exceptions that are technically true. i'll list a few to save the trouble: a person with reckless spending or addiction gambling issues should not have this split. significant inheritances should not necessarily have this split the extremely rich or extremely poor should not necessarily have this split massive debts massive differences in work time lots of other exceptions but for most people, i think this split is the best method. money has an economic value. if you compare the salary of a strategic consulting manager and a veterinarian assistant, you're going to get 200k versus 40k or something crazy. but in a relationship, i don't think economic value should necessarily be considered, unless the difference in income is so vast that one person's income is literally chump change i. e. 500k vs 30k . in a relationship, especially that of a marriage, the 'most important value' is time and effort of the individual. person1 makes 80k after taxes; person2 makes 40k. person1 would input 40k into their joint account, while person2 inputs 20k. as a result, in real money, person1 is providing more. person2 is also providing 50 . caveat. please read this caveat. let's say for example i make 100k and my partner makes 20k. i put in 50k and keep 50k while she puts in 10k and keeps 10k. unfortunately, that means that i get to live it up and have a pretty damn good life whereas she has to keep both savings and expenses under 800 per month. so why this view? 1. 2. provides freedom to both people and rewards high earners in exchange for providing more this allows both parties to win. 3. this makes their life much more difficult and makes them less capable of affording more. 4. gifts are more meaningful in a fully shared money situation, gifts are important but also become difficult to justify. makes for a difficult situation. 5. use your own money. no problem! want to buy a ps4? no need to ask me, go for it! want to go out and treat 10 people out to drinks? go for it! not my money, not my problem. again this is basically the freedom argument. caveats i know there are exceptions to this rule. i'll try to list out as many as i can. and yes some of this repeats from the beginning of the post but i thought mentioning it twice makes it more likely for everyone to see it. here's a real life example. i make 80k and my girlfriend makes 30k post taxes. but neither of us works harder than the other. she makes 30k because she chose a career that's important for the world, but pays very very little. if we do a 75 75 split, then i end up keeping 20k per year. she gets 7. 5k. maximum retirement contribution is 5. 5k. so now i have 14. 5k left and she only has 2k. 2k for a whole year is nothing. she can barely afford anything for herself. i keep 20k, she gets 15k. now it's more even, now it's fairer. cmv"," A joint account with a percentage-of-income (with a few other considerations) is the best way to split money : i know this can have a lot of exceptions. please don't make your arguments about pointing out 2 or 3 exceptions that are technically true. i'll list a few to save the trouble: a person with reckless spending or addiction gambling issues should not have this split. significant inheritances should not necessarily have this split the extremely rich or extremely poor should not necessarily have this split massive debts massive differences in work time lots of other exceptions but for most people, i think this split is the best method. money has an economic value. if you compare the salary of a strategic consulting manager and a veterinarian assistant, you're going to get 200k versus 40k or something crazy. but in a relationship, i don't think economic value should necessarily be considered, unless the difference in income is so vast that one person's income is literally chump change i. e. 500k vs 30k . in a relationship, especially that of a marriage, the 'most important value' is time and effort of the individual. person1 makes 80k after taxes; person2 makes 40k. person1 would input 40k into their joint account, while person2 inputs 20k. as a result, in real money, person1 is providing more. person2 is also providing 50 . caveat. please read this caveat. let's say for example i make 100k and my partner makes 20k. i put in 50k and keep 50k while she puts in 10k and keeps 10k. unfortunately, that means that i get to live it up and have a pretty damn good life whereas she has to keep both savings and expenses under 800 per month. so why this view?

can stick with so your brain can make you happy.","i don't know what you're talking about, but i think you're missing the point. you're saying that there is no need for work, but there is a need for money. if you want to live a fulfilling life, you're going to have to work for it. but if you don't want to work, you'll have to find a way to survive.","i think you're confusing the need for money with the desire for fulfillment. if you don't have to work, then you can't have a happy, more fulfilled life if you didn't want to work.","i don't think working to survive is enslaving people. i think it's just a matter of time and money. if you want to make a living, you need to work. but if you don't, you can't."

" Poe Dameron was not simply just wrong for questioning Admiral Holdo and taking action, nor was he the ""true villain"" of TLJ.","i think i maybe should've made this 'cmv: holdo should have done something to inspire all members of the resistance to trust in her and not come up with a plan of their own especially considering poe's history . ' poe obviously made some serious mistakes previously, but i believe that in regards to the chase and their plans, he and holdo were both right and wrong in some respects. i recently had a discussion with someone where they told me that they thought that he should have just trusted her and done as he was told, that all in the military should always follow their orders without question though i'm not trying to open another rabbit hole with that , and that the scene was meant to illustrate how men need to just shut up and listen to women. she may have had a plan and it may have worked and by that one could argue that she was right; i see this as a parallel to the jedi at large. i believe this ties in with luke's saying the jedi need to end and all of that to illustrate how even if one group may be in some way right, if they can't effectively communicate why they're right or something else to get people to trust in it enough to actually implement it, it's not going to succeed or produce the desired change or outcome regardless. like how much anakin was preached to about the evils of the dark side but was never communicated the realities of it well enough to successfully instill in him what it would take to get him to have not gone down that path. holdo failed as a leader by failing to instill the faith in her needed for her plan to work successfully. it's 100 fair for her to not have wanted to divulge specific details in an effort to safeguard the plan, but given what she thought of poe as a person i think it's completely fair to say that she definitely should have at least simply told him that she did have a plan and that she wasn't just going to let them all die without even trying to do anything, which is what she led them to believe was happening. she didn't even have a look of confidence when saying what she said to the crew, again that could have been intentional in an effort to keep the plan secret, but she should have said something more to, at least, poe. what good is a leader who knows exactly how to fix all our problems if they aren't actually a leader and can't get people to actually do the things to make those changes happen? poe was faced with a situation where he was basically told that they were just going to fly til they ran out of fuel and the enemies caught up and killed them, without even trying to do anything about it. he was given, so far as i perceived, no reason to support this order other than the fact that she was of superior rank. he made the call in his mind that since they were just going to let them all die that he would at least come up with a plan to try and do something about it, a plan which a black guy and an asian woman both also supported and helped to come up with but no one seems to talk about the black guy or asian woman who also didn't follow holdo and supported taking action on their own . this whole thing seems to be getting reduced to being about sex, or more specifically, the evils of white males and the patriarchy, and the fact that a black guy and asian woman also opposed holdo doesn't fit in with that notion very well. the other person also said how if he just would have followed his superior's order how the plan would have worked perfectly. one could, perhaps fairly, say that this wouldn't even be a factor or a point for me to make if he had followed orders, but i can also, i believe fairly, say that if finn and rose had followed orders and gotten the right person at the casino instead of deciding that they could make due with the option that presented itself as opposed to the one they were ordered to find that then poe's plan would have worked. really, both plans could have actually simultaneously worked. if finn and rose had gotten the right person and managed to covertly board the enemy ship and disable their shields, anyone not necessary for the fight could have escaped in the landing pods and just a few could have stayed back to try and destroy the enemy ship; in which case they would again already be facing death and if the battle started going south then they could have still simply flew lightspeed through it as holdo did on her own. i may be wrong but i think it's also fair to speculate that it would have taken fewer people in the ship for the battle than the number that died in the pods in the failed escape attempt. the last jedi, to me, was about how much more complicated these things are than any of us generally like to contend with. about the problems with the mindset of 'i'm right so you just need to shut up and do what i say because i'm right.

 Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing,"for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me?

' you say they frame it 'i believe women because i believe women', but you also say that 95 of women are telling the truth, while only 5 of men are telling the truth. doesn't that mean that believing women is the correct way to go? the fact of the matter is lives are already being wreck. women's lives, who are being sexually assaulted and harassed, are being wreck by the men who are constantly getting away with these crimes because of the framing of these accusations of 'well it was a long time ago and this is a man with a lot of influence and power, so maybe we don't want to ruin his life. '","i don't know if you've heard of ford, but i think it's a good idea to look at the statistics and see if there's any evidence to back up your claim. for example, there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that women are accused of sexual assault by men, and that's because they're women. there's also evidence that men are victims of sexual assaults by women, and there's plenty of evidence to support this claim. i don't think there's much evidence that it's true, but it seems like you're missing a big part of the problem.","i think you're misinterpreting statistics. i don't know if you've seen the statistics, but i think it's important to note that there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests that women are more likely to lie about sexual assault than men. for example, if a woman is raped by a man, she's likely to tell him that she was raped by her boyfriend. but if a man rapes a woman, he's probably going to tell her that he was raped, and she's going to lie to him about it.","i don't think the 'i believe women' defense of sexual assault allegations is toxic and wrong. i think it's a bit of a slippery slope, but i don't see how it's any more toxic than the 'you believe men because you believe women.

 Liberals have lost the desire to convince conservatives.,"i recently went to a talk on free speech and hate speech. one of the biggest take aways i got was the amount of applause a line from someone when they said something allong the lines of 'who are you the oppressor to define what hate speech is for us the oppressed .

 Laissez Faire is the ideal Governmental/Societal Structure,"as morality cannot be imposed, and the smart, or selfish, or rich will always have advantage any system, however vetted, will produce unintended consequences. the more complex the regulation or system, the harder it is to evaluate the success. welfare, government oversight, banking and industry regulation, healthcare and similar policies inevitably fail to produce better results than the self correcting selfish incentives of competition. for example: the recent fiduciary rule attempted to standardize compensation for advisory services on asset management. this was meant to be a more strict policy compared to a disclosure based, potentially conflicted, model in which suitability was the standard. the problem which was attempted to be addressed was: broker has fund a and b which are both suitable, but picks a for revenue purposes. the solution was, fund a and b must pay the same. simply put . the reality was that the industry broadly increased fees holistically, to maintain revenue levels but collect it another way. average fees went up. in the chaos of the administration change, the standard was ultimately struck down. it seems to me, that ultimately, people learn from experience, and in the learning process even systemically, many problems self correct from individual incentive. a social darwinism of behavior, as evolution has shown us the impact of selective competitive advantage with iteration, why can that not apply also to society?

 There is nothing wrong with the encouraging/ reinforcment of masculinity.,"i often see people criticizing phrases such as 'man up! ,' 'be a man! ,' etc, and claiming these are bad for young people men and women to hear. historically and biologically, men have been and are more combative than women so if a woman needs to be combative to accomplish something, i see no problem is saying 'be a man. ' this also applies to other traits such as independence. as an aside, some may argue that ideas of masculinity and femininity are purely socially construed and that people only act certain ways because of societal influence. i wholeheartedly disagree masculine and feminine traits largely have to do with the presence of sex hormones acting on the nervous system. so the idea that phrases like 'be a man' need to go away because it's keeping together a negative social construct are unfounded. if anything is unclear, i will be happy to elaborate on any ideas in the comments."," There is nothing wrong with the encouraging/ reinforcment of masculinity. : i often see people criticizing phrases such as 'man up! ,' 'be a man! ,' etc, and claiming these are bad for young people men and women to hear. historically and biologically, men have been and are more combative than women so if a woman needs to be combative to accomplish something, i see no problem is saying 'be a man.

 Rap is lower quality music and is overrated.,"before i get into this, let me be clear what i'm not trying to say : all rap is bad. rap takes no talent. people shouldn't listen to rap at all. people who listen to rap are less intellegent. all the problems i list are exclusive to rap and not other genres of music. ok, now let's get into this : 1. rap uses less people to create, which does not always indicate, but usually indicates less effort overall . obviously, the more people working on something, the more hours that can be put into something. that doesn't mean one person can't create something good, but the likelihood of an individual creating something good is statically less than that of a group. 2. most rap songs use rhymes, which can alter what the creator wants the song to mean . the creator of a song might want to portray a message, express an emotion s , or cause the listener to critically think in some way. since many rap songs rely heavily on rhyming their lyrics, they have to alter the words of the songs in order to rhyme. while this can be entertaining, the meaning of the song is often lost, misunderstood or not taken seriously. 3. rap relies too heavily on vocals and not a variety of instruments . that's not to say that rap never uses anything else, but vocals are always at the forefront; everything but the vocals is just background noise, vocals are emphasized. this means that rap as a genre lacks variety within artists and between artists. it becomes more difficult to distinguish between rap songs, and they start to blend together. this begins to ruin the perception of what's good and what's bad. on top of that, if the vocals are bad, the whole song is bad vs. if one instrument were bad, the entire song is not necessarily ruined. 4. rap is easier to learn than other genres that use other instruments, and most anyone can do it if try tried. there's no hand eye coordination with vocals as with a guitar or piano. on top of that, traditional vocals require the singer to use certain pitches consistently and at loud capacities and to a beat. this makes it easier to learn than other interments or vocals. meaning, people without natural talent can start rapping, and lesser quality songs can be made in abundance. of course, a rapper can spend an equal or greater amount of time practicing as any other musician. but remember, people can also get really good at sitting down and standing up, that doesn't equate to quality. i try to be objective, but i obviously wouldn't be making this argument if i didn't have a bias. i do enjoy some rap, i'm not completely adverse to it. other genres have similar problems, i would say the same of a lot of pop or country music. let me know what you guys think, am i way off base?

 The method of punishment should change,"'whatever undeserved evil you inflict upon another within the people, you inflict upon yourself' kant murderers should be murdered, exactly how they committed the murder. killed someone by throwing rocks at them? death by stoning. killed by shooting? criminal should be shot. thieves should lose all their property, rapists should be raped. this may be an extreme form of justice, but i believe it is one of the only just system. you see completely sick, sadistic cruel people, that only get punished by being behind bars? for example people like ariel castro. he kidnapped 3 innocent girls, trapped them, beat them, starved them, raped and impregnated them and made them have miscarriages for 11 years. 11 whole years. a complete monster. lifetime in prison?

are they dead or alive? the answer is that they are more alive, because human life is a continuum. but still barely alive. the legal system treats life as binary, not because this reflects reality, but because practically , it would be impossible to run a legal system where life was expressed in terms of percentages. it would also have some nasty side effects. living in a society where you constantly have to prove the degree of your aliveness in order to gain protections would be a terrifying experience for most people. in short, binary life is a legal fiction, but a useful legal fiction. but once we have acknowledged this we also have to acknowledge that we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, and that where exactly we draw that line is arbitrary. however, we can use biology to give us a meaningful ballpark . drawing the line at conception is silly from a biological perspective, because we know that a person's 'essence' resides in the brain, and the brain doesn't develop until later.",what is the point of killing a baby?

 Sex before marriage is to be avoided. Marriage is good (especially if you want to raise children).

' instead, both partners should engage in these activities when they both feel that they are ready for them. they should get married when they're both confident that this is the partner they want to spend the rest of their lives with. to me, a wedding is simply an opportunity to celebrate that love commitment you've created with friends and family. ultimately, marriage is a long term relationship that needs to be worked on and managed forever. it's not like you get married and start with a new relationship or you get married and all the relationship work vanishes. instead, you get married and a week later things should go back to being how they were before the stress of the wedding.","i don't know what you're talking about, but i think you're right that marriage is a bad thing. it's not just about the number of sexual partners, it's about the quality of life of the person involved. i don't think it's a good thing, but it's definitely a good idea. if you don't want to have sex with someone, you're going to have to deal with a lot of paperwork and taxes.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'legal marriage', but i think it's important to remember that marriage is not for everyone. if you want to raise children, you have to be married.",i don't think you should get married before you have kids. i think it's a good idea to wait until you have children before you get married.

' these rules are: 1. graduate high school doesn't have to be a good high school 2. get and hold a job doesn't have to be a good job 3. don't have kids until 21 or later and we might add 'don't have kids out of wedlock, given what we just examined, and brookings touches on this subject, too these things are all quite manageable. the state will pay for your high school education, all you have to do is show up. unemployment is quite low at under 4 . and if you're poor, not having kids seems like a pretty obviously good life decision. a single kid takes roughly a quarter of a million dollars to raise from 0 18 in the us. i used to be poor as shit and fairly uneducated, but even back then i knew that my life prospects wouldn't be helped out much by entering into a 18 year, 250,000 lease for an aston martin vanquish s volante and then a couple years later entering another lease agreement for an equally expensive ferrari 488. if i did that, i'd expect you to think i was rather stupid, not ply me with sympathy for my financial problems. and yet that's basically what people who have kids when they're too poor to reasonably support just themselves are doing. anyways, brookings found that for lower class people who just followed these three simple rules, 75 joined the middle class, 23 at least improved their class financial prospects, and only 2 made no class financial progress at all. so if poor black youth or poor youth of any demographic just graduate high school, get and hold a job, and don't have kids until after they're 21 and or married, there's a 98 chance they'll either rise out of poverty or at least improve their status. and again, these are things that are your own personal decisions, not the result of outside influences acting against you. you can't blame the war on drugs or police brutality for your lack of upward mobility when there's three simple things that you can do for and by yourself to gain that upward mobility. veneration of gang poverty culture and the victim complex the first part of this two parter is the hardest for me to quantify with statistics, and perhaps my weakest argument, but it's something i've noticed on a widespread anecdotal scale and felt was worth mentioning. what i've noticed is that poorer people often seem to take a kind of pride in their impoverished status. and look, i get it. i've been poor and homeless and have done some very bad things in the interest of making money that i'd detail here if so many of them weren't federal crimes. but that lifestyle only really has a few possible outcomes: you either get out of it and go straight, you end up dead, you end up in jail, or, and this is what everyone is shooting for, you become that 0. 001 of criminals that makes it big and lives in a mansion with lots of beautiful women, pet tigers on the lawn, tons of cash, and diamond studded everything. and it's that last outcome that i see being often aspired to when young, poor kids get involved in criminal behavior. but that's as foolish as banking on your garage band becoming as big as the next metallica except when your garage band goes bunk you just go your separate ways with some musical skills under your belt; you don't end up dead or incarcerated. the second part is a bigger deal, i think: the victim complex. some of your plight is the fault of your oppressors, true, but if you behave like all of it is their fault then why bother trying to improve your prospects? black publications as well as black leaders like jesse lee peterson, thomas sowell, larry elder, and the youtuber some black guy, among others, have all pointed out that this 'woe unto me' victim complex isn't doing the black community any favors if the goal is to improve the status of the black community in america. black criminality i know, i know, controversial phrasing. most crime is intraracial. and i know the predictable comeback will be: 'but u chadonsunday, they're poor and destitute and oppressed crime is their only option!

 America should have socialised medicine instead of private health care,"this has meant the worlds richest country is somehow number 37 in world health rankings. the only solution is to get over our overly individualistic instincts, and make the lives of all the individuals in our country better by adopting a fully socialised system of medicine. honestly, i've never really encountered opposing views on this, to be honest, and when i have, i've never found they made very compelling arguments so i've always tended to ignore them. i would need to see evidence health care is less expensive and higher quality in the market. i would need to be convinced it's moral to put a monetary value on the human life of someone whose sick. i would need to be convinced we can't afford socialised systems like they have in scandinavia and the uk when we're richer. and i'd need to understand what happens to those who can't pay, which is the most important question and the biggest moral dilemma? i look forward to hearing your responses!"," America should have socialised medicine instead of private health care : this has meant the worlds richest country is somehow number 37 in world health rankings. the only solution is to get over our overly individualistic instincts, and make the lives of all the individuals in our country better by adopting a fully socialised system of medicine. honestly, i've never really encountered opposing views on this, to be honest, and when i have, i've never found they made very compelling arguments so i've always tended to ignore them. i would need to see evidence health care is less expensive and higher quality in the market. i would need to be convinced it's moral to put a monetary value on the human life of someone whose sick. i would need to be convinced we can't afford socialised systems like they have in scandinavia and the uk when we're richer. and i'd need to understand what happens to those who can't pay, which is the most important question and the biggest moral dilemma? i look forward to hearing your responses!",i believe the uk should have a fully socialised healthcare system.,"the biggest issue with completely free healthcare is one that cannot be ignored, but is constantly overlooked. emergency services. allowing for free, unscreened access to healthcare creates an unmitigated disaster. i am constantly reading articles of horror stories in the uk, where people wait hours for ambulances, sit in the er for hours upon hours, and still have corners cut in their treatment. this is due to the fact that people don t pay for their healthcare, and therefore have nothing stopping them from frivolous use of emergency services. and they use them frivolously. and this is already an issue in the us. i m a paramedic, so take it from me. i d say that 60 70 of the patients i see in the er or on he ambulance, have government paid insurance. and i d estimate that 85 of patients that utilize emergency services, do not have an emergent medical problem. and i can absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, say that 100 of our frequent, frivolous users of emergency services are on government paid insurance. ask anybody that works in this field. you need to realize the significance of those numbers. government funded, unscreened insurance is the primary cause for any and all of the overcrowding of emergency services that is experienced in the us. take that problem and quadruple it, and you can see the kind of horror show that emergency services in the uk face. this problem must be addressed before we make a disaster of socialism implementation like the uk has in so many ways. now, i want you to study up on the country that has the best ranked healthcare system according to the euro health consumer index. netherlands. take a look at why their healthcare system is the best, and why it continues to only keep getting better. maybe that will help to illustrate to you the difference between implementation of a social system, and smart implementation of a social system. social systems are not inherently better, and social system is not afforded the luxury of trial and error, as other systems are. if your social system has even one flaw, it can, and usually will, become a disaster before it can ever be controlled.","the problem with this view is that it is not a moral dilemma. it is a social dilemma. if you are in a situation where you can't afford health care, then you are not going to be able to afford it. you are going to have to spend money to pay for it, which is a huge burden on society.","i don't know what you mean by'socialised medicine', but it sounds like you're talking about private health care. i don't think it's really that simple, but it seems like it's a lot harder to get over our overly individualistic instincts than it is to get rid of the idea of'socialized medicine.

 there is a relative lack of respect and deference for the social sciences.,"we have a worldwide network of universities with countless sociology, anthropology, political science and critical theory departments, yet it seems like every ordinary person off the street feels equally qualified to speculate or offer opinions about human nature, culture, politics, etc. you just don't see the natural sciences treated the same way. if someone has an interesting thought pop into their head about biology or physics, they don't just assume that thought in its current state is equivalent to research. the curiosity that gets sparked about natural science always seems to lead to a google search, at least. it certainly doesn't seem like it to me. it seems that the most people are willing to do is shop around for statistical studies that support a position they have already determined all on their own to be correct. i totally understand why this is the case. when it comes to social science, everyone seems to believe that we all have access to the same data; we are all human, and we all have experienced belonging to a society. we also have a natural tendency to try to universalize our particular perspective. i think there is a very strong temptation to do this for the sake of our own ego nobody wants to be the villain, everybody wants to be the hero. i just think that it is interesting how rarely people realize that there are legions of professionals out there who do nothing but read, write and think about the topics that they have chewed over during the margins of their day. but what's even worse is how this ignorance carries itself into our social discourse. right now there is a serious accusation of partiality and bias against politically conservative students and faculty in university social science departments. the reason for this is really quite simple: objectivity requires detachment from the subject being studied, and this detachment leads to criticism of normative beliefs and institutions that are currently in power. given that the conservative position is all about maintaining the status quo against external threats, or even returning to an ideological vision of the past when these institutions were supposedly even stronger, conservatives are obviously going to feel particularly attacked by the process of critique. conversely, liberals leftists are going to embrace the results of objective critique and become political advocates for reform. any idea, be it politically conservative or liberal, can have its place if it actually holds up to disciplinary rigor. one example is the youtube personality 'sargon of akkad' aka carl benjamin a guy who invokes classical liberalism to attack feminists and other identity groups, even though he has never critically studied political philosophy beyond what provides him with convenient arguments to rile up his viewers. another even more insidious example is jordan peterson a psychologist ! who levels accusations at the academic left without ever engaging in their scholarship, and who writes books gives lectures about political philosophy without having properly studied the topic as an academic. in both of these figures what we see is a blatant abandonment of the objectivity of academic discipline in favor of dumbed down messages that are specifically designed to fuel people's existing sense of indignation. you would never see the same thing happen in the natural sciences, or at least not to the point where such figures would be taken seriously. i think the closest things i can think of might be anti vaxxers or flat earthers, but it seems pretty widely acknowledged that these people's views cannot be trusted scientifically. they haven't done the disciplined work to arrive at their conclusions, and so we generally treat them as absurd. this is a completely separate standard that never gets applied on the behalf of people who spend just as much time engaged in a scientific discipline. change my view."," there is a relative lack of respect and deference for the social sciences. : we have a worldwide network of universities with countless sociology, anthropology, political science and critical theory departments, yet it seems like every ordinary person off the street feels equally qualified to speculate or offer opinions about human nature, culture, politics, etc. you just don't see the natural sciences treated the same way. if someone has an interesting thought pop into their head about biology or physics, they don't just assume that thought in its current state is equivalent to research. the curiosity that gets sparked about natural science always seems to lead to a google search, at least. it certainly doesn't seem like it to me. it seems that the most people are willing to do is shop around for statistical studies that support a position they have already determined all on their own to be correct. i totally understand why this is the case. when it comes to social science, everyone seems to believe that we all have access to the same data; we are all human, and we all have experienced belonging to a society. we also have a natural tendency to try to universalize our particular perspective. i think there is a very strong temptation to do this for the sake of our own ego nobody wants to be the villain, everybody wants to be the hero. i just think that it is interesting how rarely people realize that there are legions of professionals out there who do nothing but read, write and think about the topics that they have chewed over during the margins of their day. but what's even worse is how this ignorance carries itself into our social discourse. right now there is a serious accusation of partiality and bias against politically conservative students and faculty in university social science departments. the reason for this is really quite simple: objectivity requires detachment from the subject being studied, and this detachment leads to criticism of normative beliefs and institutions that are currently in power. given that the conservative position is all about maintaining the status quo against external threats, or even returning to an ideological vision of the past when these institutions were supposedly even stronger, conservatives are obviously going to feel particularly attacked by the process of critique. conversely, liberals leftists are going to embrace the results of objective critique and become political advocates for reform. any idea, be it politically conservative or liberal, can have its place if it actually holds up to disciplinary rigor. one example is the youtube personality 'sargon of akkad' aka carl benjamin a guy who invokes classical liberalism to attack feminists and other identity groups, even though he has never critically studied political philosophy beyond what provides him with convenient arguments to rile up his viewers. another even more insidious example is jordan peterson a psychologist !

we should let people get comfortable with more gender conforming trans people that fit into cis society without requiring many changes, before we unleash the ey em genderfluid pansexual anarchocommunist demigirls i make fun of you 'cause i love you! . a few examples of strategies i'd like to see in the movement: redefine gender as something along the lines of 'if your birth certificate and sex hormones agree on one of 'male' or 'female', that is your gender. if not, you may self identify as either gender, and use the faculties of either gender, but may not participate in women's sports. ' this is, as the trump administration would say, 'grounded in science', while also being trans inclusive, and making at least some sense. it cedes some ground to the conservatives, while not really negatively affecting very many people's lives. i think it's a bad final definition for a variety of reasons, but i think it makes a decent starting point that is resistant to the conservative bogeyman of the weird creepy man that starts wearing a dress one day so he can use the women's room. i think that conservatives are imagining trans women as 'men in dresses' and trans men as 'women with buzzcuts'. so maybe we should make the image of trans people less 'weird androgynous in between folks' and more 'people who are basically the same as everyone else but changed their gender'. this is an example of something i'd like to see more of. we really have to stop minimizing people's concerns with the really thorny parts of the trans movement, like women's prisons, or women's sports. i think there are reasonable objections that we should take into account and think about , not just assume everyone raising them is a transphobic asshole. i am sure there are really good potential compromises on this stuff, but if we create a moratorium on anything that even kind of looks like transphobia from a distance, we're really hamstringing ourselves and there's no way we'll be able to find an effective solution that people are okay with.","how do you define 'transgender' when you're talking about people who don't identify as their gender? i'm not sure what you mean by 'transgendered', but i don't think it's a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights.","i agree with you, but i don't think you're trying to change the view of the left. there is a lot of political capital in politics right now, and it's not going to be used to change people's minds. it's going to take a long time to get people to change their minds, and that's the only way to do it. i think it's a good idea to focus on the issues you're talking about, rather than the ones that really matter. you seem to be focusing on the things that don't matter to you, not the issues that matter to the rest of the population.","1. the transgender movement is a sprint, not a marathon. 2. it's not a sprint. 3. it isn't a marathon, it's just a short sprint."
" The message of the MeToo movement should be something like “Give all women the benefit of the doubt, don’t dismiss them, and investigate their claims” rather than “Believe all women”","i have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the ford kavanaugh situation. if that is the case, i think kavanaugh will likely be voted in. this would cause an outrage because so many people reasonably do not like the idea of appointing people accused of attempted rape to the supreme court. i feel that upholding our tradition of due process is more important than any one unsubstantiated sexual assault allegation no matter how credible the woman seems. i believe she is supremely credible with regard to the claim that something happened to her. however, so far that credibility hasn t been able to be transformed into any sort of verifiability. we shouldn t believe every allegation simply in virtue of its existence. if it is positively shown to be true, action should be taken. if it is positively chosen to be false, the allegation should be dismissed. and if it can t be positively shown to be either, which may very well be the case here, i don t view it as a failure of morality to move forward as if the allegation was shown to be false. there is nothing sexist about the burden of proof being on the accuser. it is possible to show deep sympathy for an accuser and give her the time of day while simultaneously reaching the conclusion that unfortunately her claims couldn t be substantiated so no action will be taken. it is better to let guilty people go free than to punish the innocent. because i believe this, believe all women doesn t seem measured or nuanced enough for me. accusers deserve to be taken seriously and the accused deserve due process! not as catchy i know. i feel like this is a pretty rational, measured take, but it s one i don t really see represented in media."," The message of the MeToo movement should be something like “Give all women the benefit of the doubt, don’t dismiss them, and investigate their claims” rather than “Believe all women” : i have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the ford kavanaugh situation. if that is the case, i think kavanaugh will likely be voted in. this would cause an outrage because so many people reasonably do not like the idea of appointing people accused of attempted rape to the supreme court. i feel that upholding our tradition of due process is more important than any one unsubstantiated sexual assault allegation no matter how credible the woman seems. i believe she is supremely credible with regard to the claim that something happened to her. however, so far that credibility hasn t been able to be transformed into any sort of verifiability. we shouldn t believe every allegation simply in virtue of its existence. if it is positively shown to be true, action should be taken. if it is positively chosen to be false, the allegation should be dismissed. and if it can t be positively shown to be either, which may very well be the case here, i don t view it as a failure of morality to move forward as if the allegation was shown to be false. there is nothing sexist about the burden of proof being on the accuser. it is possible to show deep sympathy for an accuser and give her the time of day while simultaneously reaching the conclusion that unfortunately her claims couldn t be substantiated so no action will be taken. it is better to let guilty people go free than to punish the innocent. because i believe this, believe all women doesn t seem measured or nuanced enough for me. accusers deserve to be taken seriously and the accused deserve due process! not as catchy i know. i feel like this is a pretty rational, measured take, but it s one i don t really see represented in media.",Kavanaugh should be confirmed based on the credible allegations made against him,"is that even the view of the metoo movement?

 Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication.,"my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable."," Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication. : my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable.",I believe that psychiatrists should not be allowed to diagnose children with mental illness.,"i think this decision should be left to doctors who study thousands of patients for years to determine what works and what doesn t. it should be left to their skilled opinions, not a layman s debate. doctor s wouldn t prescribe medicines that hurt unless the benefits outweighed the consequences.","i think there is a huge difference between a child and a person. a child is not mature, they are not mature. a person is mature because they have not yet reached the point where they can be a stable, integrated self. for example, a child could not be mature because he or she has not reached that point yet. this is not the case for a child, it is the case with a child. it's not a child's fault that they have a bad or aberrant behavior at any given time, it's their fault that a child has a bad behavior at a given time.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i'm curious what you mean by 'children are not yet mature'. i don't think you're going to change your view, and i'm not even going to try to change my view.",i would like to challenge your premise that children should not be allowed to diagnose children with mental illness. i think that you are missing the point. a child's brain is not mature. it's just not mature enough to be diagnosed.

 I think the Internet could eventually replace universities,"universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university? can disciplinary knowledge also become social knowledge that is freely accessed, produced and disseminated by literally anyone that might choose to participate? for this to be possible, i think we would need to see a couple big changes take place. first and foremost, we would need a sort of second wave enlightenment which would throw out the current paradigm of alternative facts and insulated echo chambers of information. society as a whole would need to accept a common sense of objectivity and rationality, such that it is able to uphold its own standards of legitimacy. bad faith research and education would need to be quickly marginalized; but we would also need to be willing to accept innovation and new ideas, as long as they meet the standards of our collective scrutiny. secondly, we would need to see some sort of system of compensation that would fund research and education as goods in themselves . as it currently stands, this is the biggest issue in higher education and research. during his presidency, reagan criticized the disciplinary knowledge produced by university researchers, claiming that they were merely satisfying personal curiosity about obscure or useless issues, and using this criticism to justify a massive defunding of higher education. the legacy of this defunding has been the increase in student tuition and debt, an increased presence of private businesses on university campuses, a new focus on collegiate athletics and recreation to attract students, the co opting of research by private interests, etc. research and education have been re cast as means to capitalist ends; research to provide technological innovations to industry, education to equip laborers with knowledge and or general capabilities needed for workplace success. for the internet to become the new medium for research and education, we would need to somehow return to a social paradigm where knowledge itself is a valid end to pursue, and education is inherently enriching , and these goods are willingly funded by society without some expectation of an economic return. can we reach this point in our future? i would speculate that we can for a couple reasons. there will come a tipping point where the continuous expansion of higher education devalues the degree such that it is no longer economically feasible to pursue. secondly, while much of what we see happening on the internet is not encouraging, there are still some bright spots, and there is still the fact that the internet is very young. we have future generations that will grow up not even knowing a time before the internet existed; we can hope that these new immersed generations will make better use of the internet as a medium for research and education. we can hope that these younger generations will react against the uncertainty and relativism of our current generations, and bring about this second wave enlightenment that would need to take place. change my view."," I think the Internet could eventually replace universities : universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university?

" ""Fat Shaming"" shouldn't be treated as actual discrimination","so in recent years, there has been a greater concern from the general american public about how we treat those who are overweight or obese. many such as those in the fat acceptance movement and other such groups have began to argue that things like pointing out someone's weight, making fun of someone's weight, and certain portrayals of overweight people in media are all something called 'fat shaming.

 Gamers are among the most oppressed demographics in society,"when we say a certain demographic faces oppression within a society, we mean that the organs of that society consistently function to

 Fathers who give up parental rights are morally wrong.,"i have a close friend who has a 4 year old accident daughter that he didn't want in the first place. he would see her occasionally over the years, taking her to the park or bringing her home to play or watch a movie, etc. my gut instinct was to try and change his mind. however, once i realized this would be impossible, i can't help but think of him as a terrible person. i understand that he's gone through hardships, with his mother being out of the picture since he was an early teen, and his dad only visiting him as a kid to fornicate with the mom and then practically disappearing later in life. i understand that he never wanted a child in the first place, and that the daughter's mother is absolutely in the wrong for hiding the pregnancy until it was too late to abort. i understand that it's beyond hard to be young and be a father. this said, i cannot fathom how one can shirk their responsibility without moral qualms. after all, he should know what kind of effects not having a father around has on a kid. but he does not care. and i think far less of him since he has confided in me."," Fathers who give up parental rights are morally wrong. : i have a close friend who has a 4 year old accident daughter that he didn't want in the first place. he would see her occasionally over the years, taking her to the park or bringing her home to play or watch a movie, etc. my gut instinct was to try and change his mind. however, once i realized this would be impossible, i can't help but think of him as a terrible person. i understand that he's gone through hardships, with his mother being out of the picture since he was an early teen, and his dad only visiting him as a kid to fornicate with the mom and then practically disappearing later in life. i understand that he never wanted a child in the first place, and that the daughter's mother is absolutely in the wrong for hiding the pregnancy until it was too late to abort. i understand that it's beyond hard to be young and be a father. this said, i cannot fathom how one can shirk their responsibility without moral qualms. after all, he should know what kind of effects not having a father around has on a kid. but he does not care. and i think far less of him since he has confided in me.",i can't help but think of a friend of mine as a bad person for not wanting a child when he found out,does it matter to you that it's a father and not a mother ? or is it the same in both case ?,"you seem to be assuming that the father of the child is the one responsible for the child's death. if so, then it seems to me that you're assuming the father is responsible for his daughter's death, as well as for the mother's decision to abort the child. the father should be responsible for her death, not the mother.","i agree with you, but i think it's important to realize that there is a difference between having a child and not having a kid. for example, i have a friend who has a 4 year old accident daughter that he didn't want in the first place. i don't know what it's like to have a child, but it's not the same as having a parent who doesn't care about your child at all.","i don't think you can change your mind, but i think it's important to remember that your friend is not a bad person. you are a good person for not wanting a child, but you are also a terrible person because you did not want a child in the first place. i don't know if you can help but think of your friend as a horrible person because he didn't want to have a child."

" When fighting terrorists like ISIS, we should toss aside 'moral' warfare for effective warfare.","since 2011 or so, isis has been raising syria to the ground, the syrian civil war has only helped them maintain their control, but although they are losing ground now, several years after they had enstated their 'state', they still hold considerable territory, and still hold major population centres in many area's of the country. isis have clearly shown themselves to be savage, barbaric and lacking with any sense of human empathy, in area's where we have driven them away we have found nothing but piles of corpses and mass graves as a symbol of their atrocities. they have captured ethnic minorities, and slaughtered them with an unremorseful stature. they have captured our own men and women, and tortured them in the most gruesome ways, before usually executing them. there are many area's in syria where city sieges have been gruesome and pyrrhic at best. the cities we enter when isis have eventually been driven out leave the exact same situation that they begun at, instead this time, the people slowly died from starvation, disease and dehydration, which is a horrible way for anyone to die. in my opinion, if a town city is of no major importance to the nation, and would be better out of enemy hands than in theirs, would it not be more ethically considerable to initiate a tactical nuclear strike? after all, it would most likely kill everyone within the vicinity instantly, and its not like the cities are going to be reused after the war ends, in most other major cities recaptured in syria, the buildings are beyond repair due to months if not years of shelling, laser guiding bombings and heavy armaments fire, so the buildings are going to be demolished anyway. how can we claim to have the moral high ground when we shell cities and cause immense human suffering simply because we lack the 'morality' to end their lives quickly? the civilians in these cities will die a slow, painful and debilitating death because we carry out yearly sieges on cities, why not end their suffering quickly? a tactical nuclear strike against a city that is not important would kill all the isis insurgents, but also bring peace to any civilians, who would no longer have to suffer. i am not saying use nuclear weapons in all circumstances, i am saying if it is more efficient and will kill less people than a city siege, and more often than not, that will be the case. city seiges simply starve out the inhabitants, only for us to enter the population area's to find a funeral spire, that we ended up creating through out 'morality' tactics. in history, no major war has taken place with the premise of 'morality' being taken seriously, look at world war 1, gas was actively used, because it was effective. look at ww2, we bombed cities and factories, without consideration for the population than lived or worked there, because ultimately, it would stop the tide of an ideology that would ruin our way of life."," When fighting terrorists like ISIS, we should toss aside 'moral' warfare for effective warfare. : since 2011 or so, isis has been raising syria to the ground, the syrian civil war has only helped them maintain their control, but although they are losing ground now, several years after they had enstated their 'state', they still hold considerable territory, and still hold major population centres in many area's of the country. isis have clearly shown themselves to be savage, barbaric and lacking with any sense of human empathy, in area's where we have driven them away we have found nothing but piles of corpses and mass graves as a symbol of their atrocities. they have captured ethnic minorities, and slaughtered them with an unremorseful stature. they have captured our own men and women, and tortured them in the most gruesome ways, before usually executing them. there are many area's in syria where city sieges have been gruesome and pyrrhic at best. the cities we enter when isis have eventually been driven out leave the exact same situation that they begun at, instead this time, the people slowly died from starvation, disease and dehydration, which is a horrible way for anyone to die. in my opinion, if a town city is of no major importance to the nation, and would be better out of enemy hands than in theirs, would it not be more ethically considerable to initiate a tactical nuclear strike?

Athletes born as one gender and go through a transition to the other gender should not be able to compete as their 'new' gender,"first off i'm fairly new to this subreddit and reddit in general so i apologise if this discussion has already been and gone. although i certainly am not well educated on the whole topic, i recall reading articles about originally male athletes dominating their field when competing against women. i am sort of hoping i am being ignorant on the whole topic and that there is an easy solution already in place because it doesn't seem fair to the female athletes being beaten by originally male athletes may also be the reverse however i have not read anything on male athletes being beaten by originally female ones .","Athletes born as one gender and go through a transition to the other gender should not be able to compete as their 'new' gender : first off i'm fairly new to this subreddit and reddit in general so i apologise if this discussion has already been and gone. although i certainly am not well educated on the whole topic, i recall reading articles about originally male athletes dominating their field when competing against women. i am sort of hoping i am being ignorant on the whole topic and that there is an easy solution already in place because it doesn't seem fair to the female athletes being beaten by originally male athletes may also be the reverse however i have not read anything on male athletes being beaten by originally female ones .",i think female athletes should be allowed to compete against male athletes in sports.,"i posted on this topic before but unfortunately i cannot dig up my old post very easily. there was a relatively minimal study performed recently on trans athletes who competed in distance running, and after as little as one year of transition the majority of athletes in that competition had very similar age and gender adjusted performance; that is, an athlete who was a 93rd pecentile 37 year old male, two years of transitioning later, performed about as well as a 93rd percentile 39 year old woman. so at least in some cases it does appear that transitioning does not retain a gender advantage on performance. it may be different for different events e. g. maybe for lifting events performance normalization takes more time , but i don't think it's fair to just conclude that trans women will always outcompete cis women without looking into it. i assume you're not thinking about trans men with this discussion because forcing them to compete as women would be bad for everybody involved .","the problem with this is that it's hard to predict the outcome of an event. if it's a women's event, it's going to be a lot more difficult to predict what the outcome will be. it's not just that women are better at the sport, but that men are more likely to be better at it. there are plenty of studies that show that women's sports are better than men's sports.",i think the best solution would be to allow all athletes born as one gender to compete as their 'new' gender.,"i don't think it's fair to exclude women from sports, but i do think it would be fair to allow women to compete against men in sports."

 Dogs Are Better For Defending Your Home Than A Gun,"so, i'm a big fan of the second amendment, former military, experienced and trained in how to handle a firearm. i really enjoy the hobby of shooting, and spend a lot of time around like minded gun folks. because of this, i truly believe that many american's stated reason for owning a gun, home defense self defense, is absurd. a lot of my friends have described the 'self defense fantasy' wherein they heroically grab their gun and blow about the bad guys who break into their house in the middle of the night. i spent a year in iraq on qrf, sleeping with my rifle and a 30 round mag next to my head, and i know that i'm utterly useless for the first few minutes after i wake up. the idea that i could be awoken, armed, and thinking straight is already a lot to ask of me the guy with the military training . especially because adrenaline will almost certainly be flowing, and adrenaline makes you stupid, very stupid. don't believe me? try a shoot don't shoot course. see what you shoot. 2 laws for self defense typically don't let you go about shooting people, even in your own home. afaik the only state that lets you shoot somebody to defend your property is texas. it doesn't matter how much your tv is worth, in 49 states it's against the law to shoot somebody for taking it. furthermore, in many states, you have a duty to retreat, meaning that you must only use lethal force if you're cornered and have no other option. in other words, if you shoot somebody in your house, you might very well wind up on trial. 3 the chance of hitting the wrong person is non zero, and therefore needs to be considered. ricochets are weird, and once you pull that trigger there's a good chance the slug will wind up somewhere you hadn't thought of. especially when you're hopped up adrenaline and shooting in a dark room at night. 4 keeping a 'self defense ready' firearm ie accessible from your bedroom, with a round in the chamber or a mag within reach is a real hazard. i personally don't trust drunk me near a gun, because drunk me is an idiot. when i lived with my parents, i got the scare of my life when i found my 14 year old brother playing with my ak one day. it doesn't matter how secure your lock is, or how well you think you hid it, the people that live with you know how to get in there, and know where it is. 5 in many cases, calling 9 1 1 and barricading your door is going to do a better job of protecting you. the police officers who are awake, unlike you have legal authority to shoot, and will be be better equipped to deal with the bad guy. i realize this may not apply if you live in a super rural area where 9 1 1 could take 20 minutes to get a cop to you, but the overwhelming majority of americans don't live on a wilderness preserve in alaska. compare this to a dog. for the purposes of this cmv, i'm assuming a housebroken dog of at least a somewhat large breed, although not necessarily a mastiff or something huge. 1 your dog will absolutely hear somebody messing with your door in the middle of the night. your dog will also make it abundantly clear to that person that they've been detected, which may be enough to convince a would be home invader to try another house. they're ready to roll as soon as they spring awake, even if it's just going into a barking fit, during which time you can call 9 1 1. all of this happens without you having to go to the range on a regular basis to practice shooting. 2 laws about a dog biting somebody on your property vary wildly, but they generally don't treat it as harshly as shooting somebody on your property. this is also, of course, assuming your dog bites somebody, which they might not do, they might just go into a barking fit, which still served a valuable purpose. 3 in my experience, dogs know who should and shouldn't be in the house and react accordingly once they've identified you. even when i used to come home from the bar at 1am trying to sneak in so my wife doesn't yell at me, my dogs recognized me as soon as they're close enough to smell me. but not before they woke up the whole house to announce that a potential robber was coming in! this drastically reduces the chances of 'friendly fire' from a panicky person firing gunshots randomly in their house. 4 a well trained dog isn't a hazard. my pit bull boxer mix patiently watches my son try to chew on him. my shepard mix thinks that my son is his best friend and tries to comfort him when he starts crying. i can leave my son alone with my 2 dogs and know that when i come back i'll still have an intact heir and 2 dogs. if i left my kid alone with a gun, i'm not so sure. you can only defend your home while you're physically there. i'm writing specifically about the 'home break in overnight' scenario. i also feel that concealed carry for self defense is not as sound of an ideas as people think it is, but that's not in the scope of my argument above. i'm also writing for, say, 80 amp; 37; of households. obviously not everybody can have a dog either because their lifestyle, their allergies, or their landlord won't allow it. and an untrained dog is a hazard. i would never advocate getting a big scary breed and leaving in the backyard for its entire life. that serves no purpose, and imho creates its own hazard when this unsocialized asshole dog inevitably does get loose. what would change my view would be something that really refutes any of my above points, especially if you can show me statistics proving a gun is a more reliable for of defense than a dog. or if you can show me some legal precedent that a dog used for self defense is at least as legally precarious as shooting a gun at a home invader."," Dogs Are

" The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part","the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation? answer: they know people will pay to see it. 3. i think all the changes they have typically made between the original and the modern remakes have been 100 for the worse from my standpoint but 100 for the safer from a marketing standpoint. e. g. instead of the beast from beauty and the beast being a beast , he s like a tall muscly guy with a hairy face. in the cartoon he was an actual monster, not unlike a bearwolf hybrid. but this was more palatable in the 3d animation medium to marketers."," The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part : the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation?

 People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion.,"i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to? i feel like my life would be over if i was forced harshly to be a mother. also, i understand some of you will say that the child could be put up for adoption. however, i still believe that the woman shouldn t have to go through with the pregnancy, it should be her choice. even if somebody else can t conceive a child doesn t mean somebody else should. having a few less children in the world will be good. i understand that you may be pro life, which is fine. but i just think that they shouldn t project their views onto other women as we all deserve to make the choice for ourselves. it has been brought to my attention that things are different in the us than in the uk."," People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion. : i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to? i feel like my life would be over if i was forced harshly to be a mother. also, i understand some of you will say that the child could be put up for adoption. however, i still believe that the woman shouldn t have to go through with the pregnancy, it should be her choice. even if somebody else can t conceive a child doesn t mean somebody else should. having a few less children in the world will be good. i understand that you may be pro life, which is fine. but i just think that they shouldn t project their views onto other women as we all deserve to make the choice for ourselves. it has been brought to my attention that things are different in the us than in the uk.",i believe that women should be able to choose whether they want a child or not.,"to be honest, if someone wants to take an abortion, they should probably just do it because it's best for them, society and the baby if they just had the abortion because they clearly weren't prepared to have a child yet. but i feel that we should actually shame women for it because of the economical implications of abortion! there have been more than 58 million abortions, most of it would be due to not being able to raise the child, not wanting the child or accidental pregnancy while the rest would be to not want to bring an ill child to this world or something to that effect. now, abortions can cost from 0 975 so i read, could be more so we have spent billions at most and millions most probably on abortions that wouldn't have happened if these people took contraceptive pills, we need to shame them so that they more likely take steps like taking contraceptive pills because that money wasted could've gone to somewhere else more productive!","i don't think it's fair to force a woman to have a child when she doesn't want one. it's not fair to coerce a woman into having a child, it's unfair to force her to have one.","i agree with you, but i think it's important to remember that people are not entitled to their own opinion. if you want to have a child, you should be able to do so. for example, if you have a disability, you can't be forced to have sex with a disabled person, but if you get pregnant, you have to give up your disability.","i don't know what you're trying to say here, but i don't think you're going to change your view. if you don't want to have kids, you shouldn't be forced to have a child."

before ethnic nationalism, those questions weren t particularly important. with ethnic nationalism, it took multiple catastrophic wars to settle them. you mention foreigners going back to their homeland. but in many cases people were in their homelands, only for their homeland to become someone else s ethnostate. if the german ethnostate was going to use these ancient homelands to lay claim to territory von der maas bis an die memel and von der etsch bis an den belt, then the obvious solution was to expel everyone from those homelands. by the logic of the ethnostate, ethnic cleansing makes sense. the same story repeats itself for every ethnostate. france looks unified today, because they spent the last 200 years suppressing anyone who didn t fit the mold of french. the spanish attempt at an ethnostate inspired a violent ethnic revolt yugoslavia united itself under the banner of the southern slavs, until they remembered that croatians, serbians and bosniaks are completely different, even if their families had lived next door for hundreds of years. ethnostates look great if you re in the dominant group, but there really isn t any way to make one without a trail of atrocity and abuse along the way.","i don't see how this is a good thing, but i don't think it's a bad thing at all.",i don't see how this is a good thing. i think it's a good idea to have a system where people are free to go wherever they want. i don't think that's the best way to do it.,"i think it's important to remember that multiculturalism is not a new thing, it's just a way of looking at the world from a different perspective."

 Cast iron cookware fucking sucks.,"it is simply so heavy and unsanitary to me. so much stuff sticks to them and they seem so so dirty to me. if you scrub them, they are literally impossible to get clean if you run your finger across it, it s pretty much guaranteed to have stuff on it , and they are so high maintenance and rust prone. you have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off. it s disgusting, heavy, and high maintenance, with no super amazing benefits. change my view."," Cast iron cookware fucking sucks. : it is simply so heavy and unsanitary to me. so much stuff sticks to them and they seem so so dirty to me. if you scrub them, they are literally impossible to get clean if you run your finger across it, it s pretty much guaranteed to have stuff on it , and they are so high maintenance and rust prone. you have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off. it s disgusting, heavy, and high maintenance, with no super amazing benefits. change my view.",I think cigarette butts are disgusting.,"first, cast iron is far superior to others for many reasons, but to me mainly because of the very high heat retention, which is a product of the heaviness. this gives you much more uniform cooking all the way around. have you ever boiled water in a cheap pan on an electric coil stove and noticed you can see the bubbles in the ring pattern of the coils? your food will cook this unevenly too, but not so with a good cast iron because it distributes the heat better. this heat retention also helps with cooking meat. want to brown a roast? you need high sustained heat for that. the problem with other pans is that as soon as the roast touches the pan, the roast cools the pan down to too low a temperature to brown it well, while the stove struggles to keep the temperature up. but with cast iron, get that sucker smoking hot and go for it. the same applies to steaks. steaks made on aluminum suck, but they can be great on cast iron. it also helps for frying because the heat retention helps keep the oil at a constant temperature. you dunk your fries in, the oil tries to cool down, the pan has heat immediately available on all sides to keep it hot, then the stove works to reheat the pan. now as to care and expectations. don't take a brand new cast iron and try to cook an egg in it. cast iron is seasoned using carbon deposits from oils, that's the 'gunk' on it that you want to keep, and it protects it from sticking and rust. after a time, and with proper care, this seasoning only gets better and better. eventually it will form a practically non stick surface that will have your eggs sliding right off. i have a jet black pan that little can stick to. in the early days stick to frying things that don't tend to stick. in the exact opposite of teflon, the pan will only get better with each use. as for cleaning? who needs soap and scrubbing like with stainless steel? who needs to worry about harming that delicate teflon surface? with a well seasoned pan i can usually just rinse it in the sink and wipe with a paper towel. if something stuck a little, a light rub with a steel scrubbing pad takes care of it. added bonus, it makes for a great self defense weapon in a pinch. more bonus, treated right, the pan will last longer than you, your kids, and your grandkids. and more, when heated to high temperature they don't give off poisonous vapors like non stick pans do. if you way overheat them say, left a dry pan on high and you walked away for a while , the worst that happens is your burn off your seasoning and kitchen is full of regular smoke. then you re season and start over. okay, one last thing. they are the best for cooking food that goes from stove to oven. the absolute best corn bread is made by melting butter in a cast iron skillet on medium heat, pouring the batter in, waiting for it to bubble a bit, and then putting it in the oven to bake. the crust is heavenly. the same applies for pineapple upside down cake. you're missing out if you're just making that in a baking pan. no, get all that butter and brown sugar sizzling, drop in your pineapples and cherries, dump in the batter, then put it in the oven. with a properly seasoned pan the cake will fall right out. i suggest watching some videos about cast iron seasoning. it makes more sense when you can see what a good pan looks like and what it can do.","i think it depends on the type of thing you're talking about. if you scrub them, you can't get them off. if i scrub them with a toothbrush, i can get rid of all the stuff that sticks to them, but i can't scrape off the burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you.",i have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. i have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off.,"it's not disgusting, it's just that you don't like the smell. i'm not sure why you think cigarette butts are disgusting, but i do think they are disgusting."

' this, however, is self contradictory because predjudice for racial reasons is the definition of racism. i don't know what can change my view on this, but i am looking forward to hearing your counter arguments!",I believe that only white people can be racist.,"first, let us start with a pretty simple definition of racism: racism: treating a race as inferior to everyone else or believing your race is superior to all other races you can go check the dictionary, but they all basically boil down to this definition ' superiority' now, the whole superiority thing is important. if you think a race is 'different', but you don't think that the difference makes them better worse, then you aren't really racist. it may be a lot of other things, but it isn't automatically racist. example: i think that asians have crustier ear wax than other races this isn't racist reverse racism 'reverse racism' is really not describing traditional racism. when people are being 'reverse racist' against white people, they aren't assuming white people are dumber more violent etc. they are simply directing malice towards them based on their race. 'disliking someone because of their race' is not racism. it is bigotry. however, people don't really like using that word 'bigoted' for some reason. it is the technically correct word, but people won't use it. why do people use the term. people can absolutely be racist against white people. i know some chinese people who are racist as fuck about white people. however, this isn't what anyone is talking about when they discuss 'reverse racism'. 'reverse racism' is a buzzword to describe anti white bigotry and sentiment which exists in minority communities, frequently because of perceived racism from the white people against the minorities. many white people feel that the backlash against white people has become too severe and now this 'reverse racism' bigotry threatens to over correct and cause even more racial animosity than existed when white people were originally being super racist. it is just a word that tries to sum up a lot of political sentiment at once and wrap it in a neat little package. lots of terms like this one homophobe describes anti gay people and attempts to accuse them of secretly fearing gay people fake news a borrowed term, which was originally used to describe actual false journalism, but is now used to insult tainted or biased journalism or the appearance of bias these terms are used to quickly allow people of similar persuasions to connect and recognize one another and share the sentiment without having to share a long winded conversation. they are literally 'memes'. they are almost never as simple as you are trying to make them. if you appreciate the context and historical background of the ideas being expressed by the speakers, you will realize why they are used and why people argue against them.","you seem to be assuming that 'white people can be racist' is the same thing as 'black people can't be racist'. i'm not sure if this is true or not, but i think it's possible to be prejudiced against a group of people because of their race.","you're confusing 'racism' with 'nazi racism'. i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i'm going to try to change your view. i think you're confusing the two terms. firstly, i think it's important to understand that the term 'racist' is used to refer to people who are prejudiced against certain groups of people based on their race. i don't think that's a good way to define racism, but it's a useful way to look at it. second, i would like to point out that it's not the same thing as 'white people can be racist' or 'black people can't be racist.'it's just a way to use the word to describe someone who is prejudiced towards certain groups based on race. it's also a way of saying that people who have been prejudiced for racial reasons are not racist, because they are not. this is a very different way of defining racism. third,","you can be racist, but you can't be prejudiced against all white people. you have to be able to be racist against all black people."

anger. they also have broken logic, processing the world in black and white . even if you don't have 'severe' problems, everyone could use with therapy to see their own broken thinking patterns that they developed as a child. every time you see someone using a strawman argument, red herring, or 'whataboutemails', they're using broken logic that inevitably also makes other areas of their life

 art critics are full of shit,"don t get me wrong, i love art. i m an artist myself. yes, obviously art can have deeper meanings, however for most art which is someone trying to copy something they see or abstract , they are reading into something that isn t there. the prime example being abstract art. you can t look at a jackson pollock splatter painting and tell how the artist was feeling, he just threw paint at the paper. and better yet, every expert will have a different opinion on his emotion, but claim theirs is factually correct. likewise, you can t pull deeper meaning from a portrait because it s just a portrait of a person."," art critics are full of shit : don t get me wrong, i love art. i m an artist myself. yes, obviously art can have deeper meanings, however for most art which is someone trying to copy something they see or abstract , they are reading into something that isn t there. the prime example being abstract art. you can t look at a jackson pollock splatter painting and tell how the artist was feeling, he just threw paint at the paper. and better yet, every expert will have a different opinion on his emotion, but claim theirs is factually correct. likewise, you can t pull deeper meaning from a portrait because it s just a portrait of a person.",I believe art can not have meaning because it is just a painting.,"i agree with your premise that a critic is unable to tell you what the artist meant or felt while creating a piece, unless they were there while it was produced and were told by the creator how they felt why it was produced. so i will focus on the other half of your argument about evoking emotions. firstly, it s important to note that how a piece speaks to you is unique to you alone and does not make a blanket statement about how it evokes emotion in all viewers, because everyone will view a piece subjectively from their own point of view. art evokes emotions, even if they are simple. if you look at a piece and think i like that and nothing more, the piece has still had an effect on your perception. you don t hate it, you don t feel nothing; you like it. this feeling is unique to you and in no way more or less important than the way it affects anyone else. but it did evoke an emotion. same if you were to see a 2 year old s scribble and think that s not very good . my point is, while i agree that art critics have no right to tell other people how they should feel about a piece of art, they are entitled to voice how the piece has spoken to and affects them, regardless of how deep or shallow or pretentious they sound.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think you're missing the point of art. art can have deeper meanings, but it doesn't have to be'meaningful' to me. for example, if you look at a painting of a man, you can't really tell how the artist was feeling, because he just threw paint at the paper. that's not to say that a painting can't have deeper meaning because it's just a portrait of a person.","i don't think art critics are full of shit, but i think you're missing the point of art criticism. i think art criticism is a way to try to make a point, but it's also a way of trying to make sense of things. i'm not saying that art critics aren't full of crap, i'm saying that they're full of bullshit. however, i think they're trying to get their point across, and i think that's a pretty good way to do it. if you don't like art critics, you're probably not going to be able to convince them of their point of view.","i don't know if you've ever heard of the word'meaning' in the context of art, but i'm going to take a stab at it. it's not just a painting, it's a painting of a person. it can be interpreted as meaning, but it doesn't have to be meaning. it just has to have meaning. you can't just look at a painting and say, 'this is just a portrait of a man.'it can't have meaning because it is not a painting."
" Most cyclists on the road are incredibly inconsiderate and rude, and we should enforce them not getting in the way far more than we do.","maybe it's just where i live. but every morning evening when i drive to from work, there are packs of cyclists riding around. i think cycling is great. however my issue is often the attitude of these cyclists. they are less visible. it will be dark and many of them do not wear anything to stick out properly. they often travel in packs. packs that, instead of riding single file along the side of the road, clump together blocking huge portions of the road. i see no reason why this is necessary. the result is they cause traffic jams and instill fear in drivers like me."," Most cyclists on the road are incredibly inconsiderate and rude, and we should enforce them not getting in the way far more than we do. : maybe it's just where i live. but every morning evening when i drive to from work, there are packs of cyclists riding around. i think cycling is great. however my issue is often the attitude of these cyclists. they are less visible. it will be dark and many of them do not wear anything to stick out properly. they often travel in packs. packs that, instead of riding single file along the side of the road, clump together blocking huge portions of the road. i see no reason why this is necessary. the result is they cause traffic jams and instill fear in drivers like me.",I believe that cyclists cause more problems than they solve.,"cyclists are encouraged to cycle in the middle of the lane rather than against the curb for two main reasons. a the edge of the road contains most debris and drains which can be lethal hazards to cyclistsb you ve already alluded to trying to squeeze past cyclists within your own lane . this is dangerous and irresponsible and is the very reason cyclists block you from doing it. on your point about packs, they re far easier to overtake assuming they are in one lane than a long string of cyclists, simply by waiting for a space on the other side of the road. the only way to overtake a long string of cyclists is by dangerously squeezing past them as per b . treat it as a tractor. it s slow, it s an annoyance, but is has as much right to be there as you. only overtake when it is actually safe to do so. if you know that cyclists are prevalent on your route then leave an extra 2 mins early to account for the minimal delay you experience.","i think you're missing the point. there's a lot of people who ride in packs all the time. i'm not sure if you're familiar with it, but i think it's important to note that it's not just the people riding in packs, it's also the people who are riding in groups. i don't know if you've ever seen a pack of cyclists, but it's definitely a lot more prevalent than it used to be.",i think it's a good idea to have a limit on the number of cyclists you can see.,i don't think there is a reason why cyclists cause more problems than they solve.
 Artificial intelligence can't become conscious.,"i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there? ultimately, a computer is little more than a memory store and a processor. programs are stored in memory and their instructions are fed one by one into the processor. the instructions themselves are incredibly simple load and store numbers in memory, add or subtract these numbers, jump to a different instruction based on the result that's actually about all you need. all other instructions implemented by modern processors could be written in terms of these. computer memory doesn't have to be implemented via electrical transistors. you can use dots on a sheet of paper or a bunch of rocks sitting in a vast desert. likewise, the execution of program instructions doesn't have to be automated a mathematician could calculate by hand each instruction individually and write out the result on a piece of paper. it shouldn't make a difference as far as the software is concerned. what if our mathematician, hand computing the code to our ai, wrote out all of his work a complete trace of the program's execution? let's say he never erased anything. for each instruction in the program, he'd simply write out the instruction, its result, the address of the next instruction, and the addresses values of all updates to memory or, alternatively, a copy of all memory allocated by the program that includes these updates . after running the program to completion, what if our mathematician did it all again a second time? the same program, the same initial memory values. would a consciousness be created a second time, albeit having exactly the same experiences? a negative answer to this question would be very bizarre. how could the universe possibly remember that this particular program was already run once before and thereby force all subsequent executions to not develop consciousness? what if a layman came by and copied down the mathematician's written work, but without understanding it. why should it matter whether he understands what he's writing? arguably even the mathematician didn't understand the whole program, only each instruction in isolation. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, when written down, would automatically develop consciousness? what if our mathematician did not actually write out the steps of this second execution. what if he just read off all of his work from the first run and verified mentally that each instruction was processed correctly. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, if even just read , would automatically develop consciousness? why should the universe care whether or not someone is actively reading these symbols? why should the number of times the program develops consciousness depend on the number of people who simply read it? to change my view, you could explain to me how a program running on a modern future turing equivalent computer could develop consciousness, but would not if run on a computationally equivalent but mechanically simpler machine. alternatively, you could make the argument that my absurd consequences don't actually follow from my premises that there's a fundamental difference between what our mathematician does and what happens in an electronic fluidic mechanical computer. you could also argue that the human brain might actually be a hypercomputer and that hyper computation is a realistic direction for ai research, thereby invalidating my argument which depends on turing equivalence. what won't change my view, however, are arguments along the lines of 'since humans are conscious, therefore it must be possible to create a consciousness by simulating a human brain'. such a thing would mean that my absurd conclusions have to be true, and it seems disingenuous to hold an absurd view simply because it's the least absurd of all others that i currently know of."," Artificial intelligence can't become conscious. : i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there?

" The phrase ""that's just the way things are"" shouldn't be considered valid justification for cultural norms","we're currently seeing a huge paradigm shift on how we perceive people smoking marijuana, for example. there are plenty of catalysts for these reversals, but a large component involves people seriously thinking about whether accepted beliefs are good for society. this often involves people discussing what the merits of a social norm are. this is a non answer, and when i find myself discussing this sort of thing, i don't see it as a good reason to keep the norm. of course, it's not a reason to discard it either. when people say this, it usually means one of two things. sometimes it's just a way of blindly following the status quo. i'm of the opinion that shaking up the norm is sometimes required, so this feels unsatisfactory as well. change my view."," The phrase ""that's just the way things are"" shouldn't be considered valid justification for cultural norms : we're currently seeing a huge paradigm shift on how we perceive people smoking marijuana, for example. there are plenty of catalysts for these reversals, but a large component involves people seriously thinking about whether accepted beliefs are good for society. this often involves people discussing what the merits of a social norm are. this is a non answer, and when i find myself discussing this sort of thing, i don't see it as a good reason to keep the norm. of course, it's not a reason to discard it either. when people say this, it usually means one of two things. sometimes it's just a way of blindly following the status quo. i'm of the opinion that shaking up the norm is sometimes required, so this feels unsatisfactory as well. change my view.",I don't think there's any good reason to keep a social norm.,"i mean do people actually consider that valid justification though? i ve only ever heard that said when the point is basically there is no good reason but that s how things work so tough shit . that s not really a justification, it s just another way of saying well life s not fair . now if you re trying to say it s not a good argument when people say we ve been doing this for thousands of years so that must mean it s a good thing then i agree with you. i think that s what you re trying to get at but that s different than what you actually said",i don't think it's a good reason to keep the norm. i think it is a good way to change your view.,"i'm not sure if you're familiar with the phrase 'that's just the way things are' or not, but i think you're missing the point. i think it's important to understand that when people talk about cultural norms, they're talking about what they consider to be the norm, not what they actually mean. for example, if you were to say that you don't believe in a certain type of religion, you would not be able to prove it. if you believe that you believe in certain kinds of religions, you'd be unable to prove that you actually believe in them.","there is a good reason to keep a social norm, and there is a bad reason to not keep it."

 It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged,"i am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. english is not my native language so i will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. for the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million usd. any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. in fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. now, i am not saying hand out the poor free money. that makes people dependant. rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. what benefits society is considered the most important. reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. the virtues of simple living are prized highly as well."," It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged : i am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. english is not my native language so i will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. for the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million usd. any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. in fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. now, i am not saying hand out the poor free money. that makes people dependant. rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. what benefits society is considered the most important. reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. the virtues of simple living are prized highly as well.",i believe that we should not spend any money on the poor.,"is it fair to say that you see the suffering of poor people as far and away the best use of money? assuming that's true, might i be able to do more good for them with more money than just donating it? an example might help here. lest say i have 1 that i can donate. the best i can probably do with that is to give it to some poor person so they can afford some food or a bottle if clean water or whatever. but if i have 100, can i find a way to do more than 100x the good? like, maybe by building a water pump to get clean water. that pump would provide more than 100 worth of food for those people over its lifetime. but what if we scale it further? maybe if i had 100million that i could spend, i could finance the building of a factory that makes the water pumps in their country. so i'm providing jobs for people while still indirectly helping them get clean water. if i'm improving the entire country, i'm probably doing proportionally more good than just giving a million pumps. if you follow this line of logic, then it makes sense to make as much money as i can, and simply donate most of it when i die. this is because it's a lot easier to make a lot of money if you already have a lot of money, so if i'm keeping myself at your 50 mil cap, i'm limiting the net amount of good that i'll be able to do in my lifetime.","i don't think you can change your view. i think it's important to understand the concept of 'capitalism' in the context of the us. if you want to argue that the poor have a right to this ridiculous amount of money, then you can argue that it's the same thing as the rich. but the problem is that the rich don't have the right to that amount. they have the ability to pay for things they don't want to. they can't afford to buy things they want to buy, but they can buy things that they want. you can't force the rich to buy stuff they want, but you can force them to buy something that they aren't willing to buy.",i think it is immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged.,i think you're missing the point. there are a lot of people who don't want to spend money on the poor. they don't need to spend any money at all. they just need to get to the bottom of the problem.

 We can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of AR-15-pattern rifles,"i'm pro 2a, and am licensed for concealed carry in several states. here's why: the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation , and quick amp; easy reloading. for sure, there are other competing semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal, but the proof is in the pudding: ar 15 popularity is through the roof compared to those. the mini 14 suffers from awkward slow reloads, and an odd method of inserting a magazine. just that alone is good reason to consider restricting its availability. these shooters rationally chose the best, most inexpensive, most effective gun for taking down masses of people. i believe that the overwhelming majority of ar 15 owners aren't mass shooters. the problem is that their guns are often taken or stolen. i believe that there's a line acceptable to the 2nd amendment between what's acceptable for civilian use, and what is restricted for military use. tanks and bombs are on one side of that. i believe that ar 15's should be on that same, off limits side. i also believe it's easily possible to draft a law to limit them. i saw that on a quora answer."," We can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of AR-15-pattern rifles : i'm pro 2a, and am licensed for concealed carry in several states. here's why: the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation , and quick amp; easy reloading. for sure, there are other competing semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal, but the proof is in the pudding: ar 15 popularity is through the roof compared to those. the mini 14 suffers from awkward slow reloads, and an odd method of inserting a magazine. just that alone is good reason to consider restricting its availability. these shooters rationally chose the best, most inexpensive, most effective gun for taking down masses of people. i believe that the overwhelming majority of ar 15 owners aren't mass shooters. the problem is that their guns are often taken or stolen. i believe that there's a line acceptable to the 2nd amendment between what's acceptable for civilian use, and what is restricted for military use. tanks and bombs are on one side of that. i believe that ar 15's should be on that same, off limits side. i also believe it's easily possible to draft a law to limit them. i saw that on a quora answer.",i think the ar-15 should be restricted to military use.,"less than 1 of all ar 15s will be used to shoot up a school made up guess, but it's probably true i know there's a pattern, but millions of ar 15s are used entirely legally. you said something about guns being stolen, but that really doesn't happen that often iirc. if it does, just make gun safes mandatoryalso, the civilian ar 15 has never been used in the military. ever.","the ar 15 is one of the best light rifles ever designed. it's easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation, and quick amp; easy reloading.",i don't think you can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of ar 15s.,"the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed, but it's not the most effective. it's also the best weapon that can be used against a large group of people. i'm not saying it should be restricted to military use, but i don't think it's the best way to use it. the ar 15 has a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation, and quick amp; easy reloading. the fact that it's easy to put down masses of people doesn't mean that it shouldn't be restricted for civilian use."

would it be better to split the north and the midwest into two separate states?,"the problem with this is that it's a lot more complicated than what you're describing. it's not like the us is a single country, it's just a bunch of different countries with different political philosophies. for example, in the united states, there is a state called texas. texas is part of texas, and texas has part of california. the midwest has some of the most diverse political philosophies in the world, but they are not part of the us.","i don't know what you're talking about, but i'm going to try to give you an idea of what you'd want to happen to the united states of america."

 Crimes involving breach of trust should have more severe legal repercussions than the similar ones without.,"to elucidate my view, i'll try to frame an illustration. consider two acts of theft being performed which constitute as a crime under legal purview. case a: a man is walking down a lonely street late at night. suddenly, a mugger appears out of nowhere and robs him at gunpoint. case b: a man is walking down a busy street. a stranger walks to him seeking for help, describing a life and death situation. on humanitarian grounds, the man follows the stranger who leads him to not so happening street only to realize that it's all a setup. he is then robbed after being held at gun point. now, it is reasonable to state that the ultimate outcome in both of the cases was the man ended up being robbed. however when considered on a profound level, the varying experiences have resulted in different psychological impacts on that person. in case a, it is streetwise to avoid a deserted road to prevent from being taken advantage of. hence, the man would have estimated the probability of getting mugged and made a conscious decision. this would then conform to his existing prejudice about travelling isolated roads at night, which he would definitely avoid in the near future. however an experience from case b would have definitely scarred him by affecting his school of thought towards humanity. it would drive him to a conclusion that it is better off to avoid helping a human or anybody for that matter to avoid the risk of a false case. the next time he sees someone asking for help, even though his conscience would provoke him to provide assistance, his previous experience would say otherwise, thus deterring him from bestowing a respectable act of humanity. on an individual level it would not make a big difference, but consider the impact it would have if hundreds of individuals were robbed in a similar manner. it would then go on to be a preconceived notion that helping somebody en route to an isolated location would have disastrous implications. now imagine the plight of a person asking for help if his case was genuine. statistics suggest that majority of rape victims knew their perpetrators at least at a hierarchical level of an acquaintance. if this keeps on increasing individuals would be wary of accomplices, thus developing trust issues. events like this would make humans lean on individualism and would make them think twice before trusting other humans. and this, as far as the functioning of society is considered, would be the worst thing to happen to it. the basic intention of law is to ensure that humans act in a civilized manner in a society. however what use would the law be if society ceased to exist."," Crimes involving breach of

types of laws do already exist, though they often involve some sort of binding contract. there's also theft by deception, which seems to fit your mugging example pretty well:different states have various definitions of what is considered deception, but they typically include language such as words or conduct that create a false impression. this is probably more often invoked when someone misrepresents themself in a professional setting, e. g. a fake sales pitch or business transaction, but if the wording is something like what's shown on that legal advice page it could potentially be applied to more personal and less professional breaches of trust.","i think it's important to note that this is not a case where a man was robbed. it's a case of a man being robbed in the middle of

crime, he's probably going to know what the crime is, because he knows what it's like to be robbed. but if he was robbed, he wouldn't have known what he was doing.","what if you are a rapist and want

 The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist.,"note that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed. at the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless. i am very aware i am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber. a few of my thoughts summed up: 1. ken: hey did you hear about janet?

i m sure you can see my point here. 2. both men and women are capable of being condescending, but a man doing it to a woman needs a specific term for it? i think if you break it down the sexism lies in the assumption that a man who is condescending is just an asshole if it s towards a man and sexist if it is towards a woman. 3. why not just use he is condescending or she is condescending because both sexes are capable of being condescending. i feel like if you make a special word for one of them you are being obvious sexist. my whole point is if we say he yelled at her we should also be saying she yelled at her. just like we should be saying she was condescending and he was condescending instead of she was condescending to her vs he was mansplaining to her 4. you don t know if the man you are speaking to is being condescending simply because he is an asshole. this is in effect creating a double standard where the belief is women can freely explain things to men but men cannot freely explain to women under risk of appearing to be a sexist. i don t care for the societal institutional argument where the claim is that sexism hurt women in the workplace and society because men had more power in those roles. i did not do that. i took no part in that and don t know anyone that has. i m sorry if someone you know was hurt by that happening but i had nothing to do with it and if you can associate me with that kind of sexism because of my gender, then you are the sexist one. i am very open to other perspectives and would love to hear what you have to say :"," The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist. : note that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed. at the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless. i am very aware i am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber. a few of my thoughts summed up: 1. ken: hey did you hear about janet?

a few examples would really help as they always help get a point across for me. also, if it is to do with being condescending in general, is it solely defined as a man talking down to a woman or can it include a man talking down to a man? i'm also a man if that helps anyone's replies. thanks :","i'm not sure if you're aware of institutional sexism, but there's a very real difference between being condescending and being mansplaining. it's not sexist to be condescending, it's just that you don't know how to deal with it.","mansplaining is not sexist. it's just the way it is used. i don't think it's sexist, but it's still sexist.",mansplaining is sexist because it is sexist. it is not sexist because men are capable of being condescending. it's sexist because women are incapable of being empathetic.

 Certain private companies like the social media/tech giants should be bound by similar free speech laws as the government.,"let me start off by saying i do not think we should tolerate intolerance, but at the same time i am against censorship. these laws exist for very valid reasons, and in some places have a few, also valid, exceptions, such as calling for violence against a person or group. this means that a restaurant for example, can expel guests who are obnoxiously sharing extreme political opinions. now here is where my issue arises. take facebook for example. a social media site with billions of users. whether you agree with it or not, many people get their news from facebook. be it through news outlets posting articles on their pages, or groups sharing them, a very large number of people get their information about a plethora of topics from facebook. due to this fact, facebook has almost unprecedented power over what people can see. what can start off as extreme opinions that call for violence, ie something very clear cut and easy to determine, can slowly erode into something more grey and harder to define like 'no bigotry'. now i know this may seem like a slippery slope argument, but i am not saying it will necessarily turn into this, but simply highlighting that it is possible, and i don't think it should be. if facebook decided to update their policy to exclude things in a more vague way this could have far reaching impacts on the social sphere. there simply aren't any other platforms besides maybe twitter that can compete with facebook in terms of reaching a large audience. if you have an opinion or something you want to share, if you are barred from the widest used social media network, you are cut off from the largest way to share that idea. another perhaps more effective example would be if google skewed search results to favour a certain narrative. if searching something neutral like 'trump' in google brought up almost exclusively negative or positive articles, that would seriously impact how information was shared. google is perhaps the biggest example because they are not only a search engine, but the premier search engine for most people globally. i am aware that this would infringe upon the company's right to do what they want with their own property, but in the circumstances i think it is a reasonable concession.","

" My roommate, who is away for a month, should still pay all flat rate bills for that month","my bills are internet, gas, water, electric, and rent. i have two chief arguments for this. first, him being away does not affect these at all. if i were not living here too, then he would still have to pay all of these fees. by agreeing with these companies to have these services, he locked us into paying at least x per month in service fees. even if we decided that we no longer need water and stopped using it, we would still have to pay these fees for a year. therefore, him not using these services should have no bearing on whether or not he pays the service fees. this is assuming that we mutually agreed to these service, which we did. i would not use this argument if i had purchased cable tv that he did not want to begin with. second, these fees would have to be paid if i also left. for example, if i happened to plan a month long vacation at the same time, we would both be away and both not using these services. however, someone would have to pay the bills. by assuming his argument true, neither of us are responsible for the bills. yet, they must be paid by someone. therefore, using proof by contradiction, i must be correct."," My roommate, who is away for a month, should still pay all flat rate bills for that month : my bills are internet, gas, water, electric, and rent. i have two chief arguments for this. first, him being away does not affect these at all. if i were not living here too, then he would still have to pay all of these fees. by agreeing with these companies to have these services, he locked us into paying at least x per month in service fees. even if we decided that we no longer need water and stopped using it, we would still have to pay these fees for a year. therefore, him not using these services should have no bearing on whether or not he pays the service fees. this is assuming that we mutually agreed to these service, which we did. i would not use this argument if i had purchased cable tv that he did not want to begin with. second, these fees would have to be paid if i also left. for example, if i happened to plan a month long vacation at the same time, we would both be away and both not using these services. however, someone would have to pay the bills. by assuming his argument true, neither of us are responsible for the bills. yet, they must be paid by someone. therefore, using proof by contradiction, i must be correct.",i believe that my boyfriend is not responsible for paying all of my bills when i am not here.,he should pay half of the rent and internet because they have to be paid every month and it doesn't matter if they are used or not. the rest are dependent on usage. they do cost to be shut off and turned back on at least where i am and have a base rate. for that reason he should pay 25 or 33 of the other bills. start with 33 and agree to 25. ultimately it's better than finding a new house mate.,"i don't think you are correct in assuming that you are not paying for these services. you are assuming that he is not using these services, which is not the case. i don't see how you can be wrong in assuming he is using the services. if he was not using them, you would have to pay for them. if you were not using those services, you wouldn't be paying for them, because you would still be paying them.","you're saying that he should still pay the bills for the month, but that he shouldn't have to pay them at all.","if you're not living here, you're responsible for paying all of your bills when you are not here."
 Male and female heterosexuality are different,"based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective? i mean after all male bisexuality was prominent in certain circles of greek and roman culture, but is on the fringe of our own culture."," Male and female heterosexuality are different : based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective?

 The N-word is overly stigmatized and should be used freely in certain settings (such as academics),"i'll preface this by saying: for those of you that don't know, the n word refers to 'nigger'. i'll simply refer to the term by 'nword' from here on out to avoid offending people. and although i may share this view on other euphemisms, i'll strictly be discussing the nword to keep the conversation scope narrow. when discussing the root origins of the word, people fear speaking it out loud. even i cringed when i typed out the nword in my first paragraph. stigmatizing the word gives it more power. that's like saying, 'hey! don't remind black people that they were once oppressed slaves! keep it on the hush hush. ' i believe the attitude should instead be more along the lines of, 'blacks should be proud of how empowered they've become despite societal oppression. so keep using it. we don't care because it only shows the leaps and bounds they've made in recent decades. ' we don't use 'the c word' for chink or 'the c word' for cracker. in fact, especially stigmatizing the nword over other racial slurs seems to send a message that other racial slurs are more ok when they should all be equally frowned upon in colloquial language."," The N-word is overly stigmatized and should be used freely in certain settings (such as academics) : i'll preface this by saying: for those of you that don't know, the n word refers to 'nigger'. i'll simply refer to the term by 'nword' from here on out to avoid offending people. and although i may share this view on other euphemisms, i'll strictly be discussing the nword to keep the conversation scope narrow. when discussing the root origins of the word, people fear speaking it out loud. even i cringed when i typed out the nword in my first paragraph. stigmatizing the word gives it more power. that's like saying, 'hey! don't remind black people that they were once oppressed slaves! keep it on the hush hush.

 Rape and domestic violence carried out by female perpetrators will never be taken seriously by society,"am i an advocate for both of these things? god no. maybe they'd be mocked or slandered, who knows. south park did a very good episode highlighting this topic if anyone has seen it. i've had this opinion for a while now but decided to make this post after hearing about a video regarding it on the front page yesterday."," Rape and domestic violence carried out by female perpetrators will never be taken seriously by society : am i an advocate for both of these things? god no. maybe they'd be mocked or slandered, who knows. south park did a very good episode highlighting this topic if anyone has seen it. i've had this opinion for a while now but decided to make this post after hearing about a video regarding it on the front page yesterday.",I think gay marriage and same sex marriage should be legal.,"i'm not really sure why you think you can say that it will never be taken seriously by 'society', unless you just mean in sitcoms or something. an ever increasing number of women are convicted of domestic violence will it be taken as seriously as domestic violence by men? probably not, because men are statistically stronger than women, and serious injuries and death among male victims are far lower than the reverse. but that doesn't mean that it's not taken seriously when it happens. will there be jokes about female perpetrators and or their male victims? sure. but surely you've encountered jokes about male perpetrators and female victims, have you not? what do you call a woman with 2 black eyes? a slow learner. i mean i really don't see a lot of evidence, for example, that lorena bobbit wasn't treated seriously by the legal system for cutting off her husband's penis, do you? the fact that there are jokes about the victim in this case doesn't change how seriously 'society', in the form of our elected government, took it.","i think it's important to keep in mind that south park is not the only show on tv that has a lot of controversy over this topic. it's not like south park isn't the only one on tv. they're the only ones that have a ton of controversy about this subject. i don't think they are the only shows on tv, but i think there are plenty of other shows that do have controversy over the topic. i'm not sure if south park has any problems with this, but it seems like it's one of the few shows that has an issue with this issue.","i'm not sure if you're aware of the fact that the majority of rape and domestic violence cases are carried out by women, but i think it's important to note that there are plenty of cases of domestic violence that are perpetrated by men. there are also a lot of cases where women have been abused by men, and they have been punished for it. it's not uncommon for men to be abused, and it's common for women to be raped as well.",the issue is that gay marriage and same sex marriage are not the same thing. they are both legal.
 It is unethical to expose your child to video games.,"when parents purchase their children playstations, x box's, gaming pcs, etc, i see this is a serious moral failing. i hold this view because of the following intuitions: it decreases the child's attentiveness to school work. it can increase their propensity for violence. it can lead to the development of addictive personality. it decreases the possibility of the child focussing on other more worthwhile pursuits, such as human reading, going outside, learning, etc."," It is unethical to expose your child to video games. : when parents purchase their children playstations, x box's, gaming pcs, etc, i see this is a serious moral failing. i hold this view because of the following intuitions: it decreases the child's attentiveness to school work. it can increase their propensity for violence. it can lead to the development of addictive personality. it decreases the possibility of the child focussing on other more worthwhile pursuits, such as human reading, going outside, learning, etc.",I believe that parents should not allow their children to play at all.,"have you played any video games recently? i ask because while there is certainly no shortage of games that include violence and lots of action, there are also a great many which do not, and in fact are about things like spirituality, exploration, and what it means to be human. they are thought provoking and morally enriching. to get a sense of what i'm talking about, check out a game called journey. here is a link to a full play through with no commentary about the length of a short film :","i think it's important to note that this is not a moral failing, it's a practical one. it's not the only moral failing that i've seen, but it's the only one i've ever seen. i'm not going to argue that buying a playstation isn't a moral failure, but i think it is a moral one. i don't think there's any reason to believe that parents should be forced to buy playstations for their children, but if they do, they should be encouraged to do so.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to note that it's not unethical to expose your child to video games. it's immoral to expose them to other things, such as human reading, going outside, learning, etc.",i don't think that parents should allow their children to play at all. i think parents should be allowed to allow their kids to play on their own.
 We are all terrible people* knowing that the products we buy employ slavery.,"terrible defined as: extremely bad in a serious fashion. including, but no where near limited to: iphones, apple devices, samsung devices, many walmart products, nestle products, h amp;m products, cannabis, firestone tires, diamonds, internet pornography, and more. most of these labor sources are found in africa, particularly the ivory coast, nigeria, liberia, the middle east, asia, particularly china, and various locations in south america. and it's not necessary, there are alternatives. some may be harder to acquire, some may be more inefficient, some may be more expensive, but there are alternatives. which, yes, requires strict research this makes us entirely hypocritical when we judge others for deemed 'immoral actions' such as 'sex trafficking, rape, political prisons, censorship, abortion if you don't like it and many more. although i don't condone these actions and they are inherently bad, who are we to say that we are much better? i obviously understand the difference between kidnapping someone and buying a phone that hires a company that hires a company that uses underpaid children 4000 miles away. please, for the love of god, change my view."," We are all terrible people* knowing that the products we buy employ slavery. : terrible defined as: extremely bad in a serious fashion. including, but no where near limited to: iphones, apple devices, samsung devices, many walmart products, nestle products, h amp;m products, cannabis, firestone tires, diamonds, internet pornography, and more. most of these labor sources are found in africa, particularly the ivory coast, nigeria, liberia, the middle east, asia, particularly china, and various locations in south america. and it's not necessary, there are alternatives. some may be harder to acquire, some may be more inefficient, some may be more expensive, but there are alternatives. which, yes, requires strict research this makes us entirely hypocritical when we judge others for deemed 'immoral actions' such as 'sex trafficking, rape, political prisons, censorship, abortion if you don't like it and many more. although i don't condone these actions and they are inherently bad, who are we to say that we are much better? i obviously understand the difference between kidnapping someone and buying a phone that hires a company that hires a company that uses underpaid children 4000 miles away. please, for the love of god, change my view.",I believe that there is nothing morally wrong with buying things made in other countries.,"slavery is not bad per se. one might say we all are slaves anyhow, just the shackles are more hidden in modern society. are you advocating us not to use the items from such origins or are you advocating us to say that, even if they are outcomes of slavery, we should still use it? in both cases one might say that personal comfort triumphs in such cases and justifiably so. if not, everybody would donate all their excess to fellow men.",i don't think you're correct in saying that 'immoral' is bad in a serious fashion. i think it's more important to understand that it's not inherently bad.,you can't just say that the products you buy employ slavery. you can't say that they don't.,what do you mean by 'bad'?
