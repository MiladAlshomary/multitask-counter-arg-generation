 The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions,"as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country."," The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions : as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country.",the republicans are just as bad as the tea party.,"the ultimate thing i can tell you is to always approach a subject with the conceptualization of perspective. you start off by assuming that the person you're talking to thinks your wrong, and unless your goal is to prove yourself right, the assumption that the person your talking to is either objectively wrong or unwilling to analyze demonstrable reality should be the option of last resort, and that is the point the conversation ends. imo, a conversation should aim to reach an elevated understanding of the truth for both parties even if one or both participants shift slightly then the conversation could be seen as at least productive. first and foremost, what is your criteria for changing your mind?","i think you're misunderstanding the problem. republicans are not racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish, or foolish. they're just trying to get the attention they want. it's not that they're racist or misogynistic or stupid, it's that they are trying to make the world better. the problem is that they don't know what they're talking about.","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i'm going to give you an example. i'm a liberal, and i'm not a big fan of the tea party. i don't think that's a good thing, but it's a bad thing. i think that there's a lot of people who don't want to have a party, and that's why they're upset. i also think that the fact that the democrats are so much more focused on","the tea party is far more about white identity politics. they are far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world as a whole. the republicans are much more concerned with social issues like education, healthcare, etc. than the tea party."

 god existing would make sense,"the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from? and 2, if god exists why is there so much suffering in the world. well think of it this way, as far as we know, humans are the smartest beings in the universe. even though animals have proven to be intelligent, like dolphins and monkeys, we can t teach them human things. you can t teach a monkey how to write, read, or build a house. they re just not smart enough. my point is we are the monkeys and god is the human. what if god is so powerful that before creation, nothing existed, and he was the one who created time and perception. the 2nd problem is people think that god doesn t care because there are horrible things happening in the world everyday. but a lot of suffering comes from other people s decisions. decisions like murder, abuse, rape, and slavery come from free will. imagine if every time someone was about to sin god stopped them, god would be the helicopter parent that no one would want, this is why god gives free will, because even though everything would be peaceful, it would be slavery. humans have always preferred dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. the problem with many christians is that they take the bible literally. the bible is probably like 55 true because the old testament is older than written language so the only way to spread the information was through words. many hardcore christians are too focused on the details and forget that the morals and point of the stories are what s important. i also believe that some of the bible was corrupted and used to control people and make money, because when people are scared, they re easier to control. i honestly don t care if you re a christian or an atheist because it doesn t effect me at all. but if you can t come up with a reasonable argument to why god doesn t exist then i won t take you seriously. k, thanks for reading now change my mind."," god existing would make sense : the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from?

it means you can believe there is a god but there is no current way to prove it. your view is that it simply makes sense. in essence, you invoke occam's razor: the most likely explanation the correct. the problem with this, is that while a divine ruler is possible or at least not impossible it certainly is not the most likely, in comparison to other ideas. so what do we know? we know the organic components necessary to for life to form namely amino acids were present on archean earth some 3. 5 bya and that these components are themselves formed through inorganic processes. we know certain organisms can self organize and all organisms can replicate sexually or asexually, and that large structures such as galaxies form by rules set forth by the principles of physics to form and unravel. we know evolution can explain forms and behaviors and mechanisms of life of all kinds: from flight in birds and chemical communication in arthropods to immune systems and four chambered hearts. there are explanations for the vast majority of systems both biotic and abiotic on our earth. but then, you also mention intelligence and morality. you also mention the christian god as the god likely orchestrating our reality. let's examine these two. intelligence and morality are both very relative. we consider ourselves the most intelligent animals on earth, but we cannot organize as precisely as an ant colony. we can't echolocate our prey and we can't hunt by smell or hearing. these activities take intelligence, albeit a different kind. but let's isolate to human intelligence. chimpanzees and bonobos are in their stone age. they use the same tools our ancestors homo habilis did: rocks, sticks, grasses. given time, would they reach our 'level'? current studies suggest they could, just as we did. morality is a human construct to be sure, in that we give it a name. but all social animals have rules. wolf packs, lion prides, baboon troops and even flocks of geese follow social constraints to keep the peace in their ideal forms. isn't that what morality is? rules to keep the peace? additionally, if the christian god is the head honcho, why do all human civilizations have a set of moral and ethical rules, even if they were unexposed to the christian god in his entirety? the secular answer is that it makes evolutionary sense to preserve the species. i offer not proof that god is not real, but simply some evidence that it doesn't necessarily 'make the most sense'. that said, it leaves us to wonder who sparked the original organism? or spurred the big bang? i suppose short of god descending to our plane, it remains but an issue of faith. forgot a thing","i think you're missing the point of christianity. it's not that there's no suffering in the world, it's that there is no reason to believe that there isn't. if god does exist, then that's not a problem.","if god exists, why is there so much suffering in the world?","i think you're missing the point of christianity. it's not about god, it's about the people who worship him. there are plenty of people who believe in god, and there are many people who do not believe in him. you can't just say 'god exists' and say 'he is responsible for all the suffering in the world.'it's like saying 'god created the universe, and he created everything.'that's not the same as saying '"

' it's never safe, driving is not a passive action. 'complacency kills' is a good motto to repeat in your head. i would hate for you to be the person that dies because you drove the same road to work everyday for 8 years but were looking at your phone the day that road crews decided to block off that lane or a tree fell the night before or a dog dashes across the street. you are texting in the slow lane because you are assuming it is safer but in reality the fact that you think that shows that you are becoming too complacent and that makes it all the more dangerous. i'm being tough on you because my gf looked down at her phone for one second and didn't notice that the curb suddenly jutted out so she clipped it and rolled her car over. driving for 8 years at that point, and only going 35 miles an hour on a straight, empty road that she was very familiar with. luckily she was ok but it was certainly life changing for all the wrong reasons.","i think you're right, but i don't think it's a good idea to tailgate. if you're in the right lane, you're going to have to wait for the car in front of you to pass you, and if you are in the left lane, it's going to be a lot easier to get in the back of the car than to get out of the way.","if you look at your phone while driving on the highway, there really isn't that much to worry about.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i'm going to try to change your view. first of all, if you're not paying attention to the road, you're going to be in the wrong lane. if you are paying attention, you will be more likely to get into an accident. second, you need to be aware of your surroundings. i'm not going to argue that you shouldn't use your phone while driving, but you should be aware that you"
" As a white man, the Sarah Jeong controversy is a nonissue for my demographic.","in my opinion, there are a few reasons why this notion is flawed. 1. as descendants of the perpetrators of almost unspeakable atrocities and as white males in the midst of a society in which many, if not most, minority groups have been made substantially worse off largely by white male authorities , being okay with being held accountable for that through humor is kinda the least we can do. i know this is gonna trigger a lot of whining about white guilt cuck and whatnot, and this is a bit of a minor point, but hear me out. america, as an idea, is built on a foundation of settler colonialism, slavery, and racism which is all too often ignored. as white people, whether or not that foundation was our own design, you can be damn sure we benefitted from it. one could easily make an argument that any wealth produced by whites in america is essentially stolen goods, since its genesis is free read: stolen land and labor. i m not sure i personally buy that argument, but frankly, i m amazed that even the most progressive social justice activists are mostly content to joke about cancelling white people which seems inherently silly and really hard to misconstrue as genuinely hateful to me . 2. privilege is pretty resilient. as an example of this, i ll use south africa. even after the anc assumes the leading role in south african government, massive differences between races persist. for example, in 2008, about 13. 6 of black south africans were hiv positive. however, according to the same study, only 0. 3 of white south africans were hiv positive. for comparison, in 2008 about 0. 2 of canadians were hiv positive. link to study: i m on mobile right now so i can t link too many more studies like this but hopefully it will suffice to say that this is but one example of how much better off ruling demographics end up even long after they exit rule. this makes me skeptical of the claim that someday racism against whites will be worse than it is now, justifying preemptive action. 3. equating racism against whites with other forms of discrimination is bad because it s an enormous false equivalency. so to clarify, in an ideal world, yes, i d agree in an abstract sense that racism is bad and shouldn t ever happen. however, in our world, lots of people are uniquely targeted by the world. black people are far more likely to be arrested, there s an ongoing epidemic of suicide in the lgbtq community, and hell, there are active concentration camps for hispanic children this side of the border. in such a world, not only is it really hard for me to care about some edgy tweets some fascist dug up, but it s also really hard for me to not feel really bad about trivializing these real and ongoing struggles against systemic oppression when magapepe1488 cries racism against a relatively harmless joke. anyway, thanks for listening to my enormous libcuck diatribe, and thanks for engaging in the discussion!"," As a white man, the Sarah Jeong controversy is a nonissue for my demographic. : in my opinion, there are a few reasons why this notion is flawed. 1. as descendants of the perpetrators of almost unspeakable atrocities and as white males in the midst of a society in which many, if not most, minority groups have been made substantially worse off largely by white male authorities , being okay with being held accountable for that through humor is kinda the least we can do. i know this is gonna trigger a lot of whining about white guilt cuck and whatnot, and this is a bit of a minor point, but hear me out. america, as an idea, is built on a foundation of settler colonialism, slavery, and racism which is all too often ignored. as white people, whether or not that foundation was our own design, you can be damn sure we benefitted from it. one could easily make an argument that any wealth produced by whites in america is essentially stolen goods, since its genesis is free read: stolen land and labor. i m not sure i personally buy that argument, but frankly, i m amazed that even the most progressive social justice activists are mostly content to joke about cancelling white people which seems inherently silly and really hard to misconstrue as genuinely hateful to me . 2. privilege is pretty resilient. as an example of this, i ll use south africa. even after the anc assumes the leading role in south african government, massive differences between races persist. for example, in 2008, about 13. 6 of black south africans were hiv positive. however, according to the same study, only 0. 3 of white south africans were hiv positive. for comparison, in 2008 about 0. 2 of canadians were hiv positive. link to study: i m on mobile right now so i can t link too many more studies like this but hopefully it will suffice to say that this is but one example of how much better off ruling demographics end up even long after they exit rule. this makes me skeptical of the claim that someday racism against whites will be worse than it is now, justifying preemptive action. 3. equating racism against whites with other forms of discrimination is

enormous libcuck diatribe, and thanks for engaging in the discussion!",it s not racist to make fun of white people.,"'it is okay for me to be racist against x group for y reasons,' justifies every racist ever. prejudice is either always wrong or it's sometimes wrong depending on who says so and why. the former statement is a safe way to end racism in the world, the second statement is a dangerous and convenient way of ensuring it never ends. and that justification can be used by anyone for any reason they see fit. everyone thinks that their reasons are good enough. ghandi said, 'be the change that you want to see in the world,' specifically because no one else can be expected to hold up your own ideals but you . if you think racism is bad and you want it to die off, then you're corrupting your own moral impotus if you make exceptions for that and are more guilty than those who don't think racism needs to end in the first place.",why do you think white people are more likely to be arrested? i don't think that's a bad thing. i think it's a good thing to be a white person.,"i think you're missing the point. there are a lot of things that can be said about white people, and that's a good thing. but it's not necessarily the case that all white people are racist, it's the fact that some of them are racist. for example, i'm white, and i've never been racist, but i've been racist to a certain extent. i'm not racist to black people, i just don't think it's racist to be racist","you seem to be conflating 'racism against whites' with other forms of discrimination. i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i think it's important to remember that racism against whites is not something that can be ignored, and that it's something that should be treated as such. it's not a matter of whether or not it's okay to joke about it, it's about whether it's ok to laugh about it. for example, if you're a"

 Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today.,"this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks."," Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today. : this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks.","I believe that if you are a white person in America, you should be able to identify people who are of a different race.","i see two major problems with your argument. first, you're using the phrase 'not likely' a lot. let's use a different example. your kid is not likely to get shot by a school shooter. when you compare the number of schools that exist in america over 100,000 to the number of school shootings that have taken place less than 500 in 175 years , we can definitively say that it is 'not likely' that your child will be the victim of a school shooting. the thing is, unsurprisingly, this doesn't make people feel better about school shootings. they still happen often enough for it to be something terrifying and abhorrent to most people, and when it does happen, it has long term and wide reaching affects. the whole nation is rocked by it, and the community that it happens in is shaken for years to come. not to mention that the lives of the survivors and of the victim's families are changed forever. all it takes is for one kid to get shot at school for thousands of kids to be afraid to go to school the next day. it's the same thing with racial issues. all it takes is one instance of blatant, public racism for black people everywhere to be afraid. so even if we agree that being the victim of racism isn't likely, is it likely enough to make whole communities afraid? that leads to the second point. racism is not always blatant. it doesn't always happen in a way that makes it clear that it is racism. most examples of racism are subtle. for example, several studies have shown that people with traditionally non white names have a harder time getting a job interview, even when they have the same qualifications as applicants with traditionally white names: since 1989, whites receive on average 36 more callbacks than african americans, and 24 more callbacks than latinos. we observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against african americans over the past 25 years, although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against latinos. so when you say, 'you likely did not get rejected from that job because you are black' we can demonstrate that that isn't true. that doesn't mean that betty in hr is a raging racist who dreams of dawning a klan hood one day. it could be that even she doesn't know why john seems more qualified than hakeem. it's just a gut feeling. the same reason why my grandmother always locked the car doors when we were sitting at a stop light and a black man was waiting to cross the street. she never did that with white men. this kind of subtle racism is the most prevalent, and the hardest to prove as well. i can't prove that your dad was stopped at that store because he was black. but how do you know that it wasn't, and what makes you believe that subtle acts of racial bias aren't as pervasive as people who experience them say they are?","i'm not sure what you mean by 'racism' or 'oppression'. i mean, if you're talking about people who are racist, you're not going to meet them. you're going to have to deal with a lot of people who don't like you. i'm not saying that you shouldn't meet them, i'm just saying that there's a difference between being racist and being a racist.","i don't know if you can change your view, but i'd like to know why you think black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today.",what if i am a white person in america and i don't identify as a black person? what if i identify as an african american? what is the difference between me and a black american who identifies as a latino?
 I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome.,"the title shows my basic premise when it comes to politics. i think people should have no governmental obstacles to stop them from being able to succeed from their own merit. i think that if you are a hard worker, you deserve to be able to work your way to the top, seek out knowledge, and stand above those who weren t able to succeed the way you did. you should be able to work your way from the bottom and get to be a ceo or the president or any other top level position if you work and learn and push yourself to the top. i don t think for instance, having affirmative action programs are a good idea. the way i understand it, they try to push for diversity by for example, if two people both have the same qualifications, or indeed even if one is higher than the other, the one with lower or equal standards could get accepted instead, solely based on their race or other criteria, even if they were less qualified. another example is if you have 3 people in a room, a, b, and c. a earns a lot of money, and gets taxed at a higher rate than both b and c, despite the fact that a works harder than b and c. just because he has more money, that money is redistributed to b and c so they can also get a higher standard of living, even though they didn t work for it like a did. these kinds of ideas i think are counterproductive, especially the more they increase. in my last example for instance, if everyone was to give all their money to d, who then combined all the money and then gave it back to a b and c equally, then you end up with a problem. if a knows their money will just be given back to the b and c anyway, why try and make so much more money? and b and c, why would they try and earn more money if they know that they can just rely on a to get it for them? so now a, b, and c all have less incentive to work, and therefore they all have less money. welfare programs promote this kind of behavior as well. instead if we took it in the complete opposite direction, and they all kept everything they had, then they would all have an incentive to earn more money. a could get richer, and even employ b and c if they were willing to work for a, and b and c would realize that they couldn t just rely on a to get everything for them. they would have to work in order to survive, and would therefore have to earn things for themselves. they all have an incentive to work, and therefore must better themselves to earn things. this principle can be applied to many things, such as speech, wherein the opportunity would be everyone can speak their mind. if b and c decided that they didn t like something that a said, they could simply not associate with him. they could instead speak how they wanted to, and tell a to buzz off, and associate with what they want. if outcome was put into place, and a was not allowed to say those things that b and c didn t like, then b and c would feel more comfortable, but a wouldn t be allowed to express their opinions, and would therefore lead to a less diverse group of opinions and discussions. also, if a was to open a shop and discriminate against gay people for instance, if they all had equal opportunity, then b could open up a shop, and c might decide that they don t like a s policy that much, or perhaps c is gay as well, and decide to go to b. this would rob a of his business, and he would either be forced to change his policy, or lose money because of the customers that didn t like his policy or were refused because of it. if they all had the same outcome, this couldn t happen, but if a was religious, and didn t want to serve these gay people for instance, then it would violate his freedom of religion. i should also mention that i think this is better from a moral standpoint as well, not just a logical standpoint. in the first example, b and c are taking a s money and giving it to themselves just because a earned more than they did. they are taking away a s right to their money. in the second example, b and c are taking away a s right to speak as he chooses. he said something they didn t like or agree with, and said by law, you cannot say that anymore. i should make a distinction that this is different if a said i am going to kill you. that implies he is about to attack you, and you should be able to criminalize that. i m referring to if a said b should die in a fire. that s not nice, but it doesn t imply action. a shouldn t be criminalized for saying something mean. in the third example, b and c are taking away a s right to choose who a gives their service to. no one has a right to someone s services. in this example, the government is forcing a to do something that he doesn t want to do, violating his religious beliefs as well. that is my stance when it comes to politics. change my view!"," I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome. : the title

change my view!","i think everyone should have the right to pursue their own dreams, and not be limited by others.","i wrote this quickly so i apologize if it isn't clear is rushed. i legitimately disagree with some of your claims so i looked through the responses and didn't find any that aligned with my own objections though there are a lot of responses so if you have come across this one already, then i apologize . your thought process is great. you are beginning with a certain simplified worldview and then elaborating based on motivation, taxation, notions of what makes a good society, a good economy etc. the fundamental problem is that your initial simplified worldview is fictional or, at the very least, it does not apply in general circumstances and is thereby of only partial use meaning that you ought to supplement your view with other views when the initial conditions do not hold . i will try to illustrate this in two ways. first, you begin with 3 people in a room, a, b, and c, and you ask us to imagine that a works harder than b and c, and that a thereby earns more money. a is taxed higher and yada yada yada. this is indeed a possible circumstance. but it is not the only possible circumstance. suppose, instead, you have 3 people a, b, and c. they are clones, equal in every way. equally hard working, equally smart, equally qualified etc. there is one job opening available in this room. all three apply. all are equally qualified, but one job cannot be given to three people. accordingly, an arbitrary decision process results in person a obtaining the job. person a now makes a bunch of money and person b and c have none. the inequality in outcome, in this circumstance, is not based on hard work, or skill, determination, merit, intelligence whatever else you want to apply. i propose that the situation i have put forth, is just as relevant to the world as the situation you put forth. but your conclusions do not apply to this new situation. i would go even further though i don't expect you to be convinced by this, and making such an argument isn't essential to making my point in this post and say that the meritocracy is fictional. second, inequality in opportunity is readily apparent in the world today. i was born into a middle class family with disposable income. i was raised in an enriched environment with lots of books, emphasis on education, sports, solid reinforcement etc. not everyone has such opportunities. i have friends who had more opportunity than me. they went to private school, international trips, family members in high ranking positions in notable companies who could get them job placements. i have friends who had fewer opportunities than me. raised by single parents who had to work multiple low paying jobs just to afford rent and food, and thereby couldn't direct as much time money to environmental enrichment. this is obvious not to mention political inequalities in marginalized groups, racial inequalities, sexual, other possible inequalities , but a more general point is worth making here. there is a common tendency illustrated in your own case to suppose that intelligence, hard work, resourcefulness, cleverness, cut throatness etc. are for some reason starting properties, rather than outcomes themselves. that is, you are assuming that 'hard worker' is something that people are born with and that this somehow serves as a starting point for an idealized equality of opportunity world. this is certainly not the case. being a 'hard worker' is as much the outcome of a process as is wealth inequality. is there even such thing is equality of opportunity? two general points in closing. 1. inequality of outcome will facilitate social unrest, if that inequality is sufficiently pronounced. social unrest can be extremely dangerous, and limiting social unrest is a benefit for those with and without power. if in your hypothetical room person b and c could get very pissed off and decide to burn the room down and overthrow the system that allows person a to have inequality of outcome, it may be in person a's best interest to give up some of what he has earned, so as to perpetuate the social conditions in the room that allow him such benefits. 2. there is a silly tendency to attribute social power success to something innate inherent in a person. and this long predates genetics and the notion that genetics determine who you are is generally a very silly claim and widely known to be such among biologists experts think of monarchs who had their inherent social power justified through god and, oddly, those who overthrew those monarchs also had their social power justified through the same god. such appeals to innateness may explain inequalities of outcome though other explanations are possible or may make such inequalities seem inevitable ostensible inevitability is a powerful mechanism of social control . but why does some innate inherent quality justify inequality of outcome? i'm not sure so i bring this up to point that out to you and others. why does innate difference justify inequality of outcome? it seems to me that, in some areas at least we generally do not think this to be the case eg. in democracies today at least in the west we generally allow equal political power to each individual at least as an ideal , regardless of whether the person is a genius or an idiot, wealthy or poor, man or woman, white or black, tall or short.","i don't think it's a good idea to have a system where people are given a lot of money, but it's not a good system at all. i think it should be a system that encourages people to work hard to get what they want, rather than being forced to work for it. i don't see any reason why it shouldn't be a bad system.","the problem with affirmative action programs is that they are designed to help people who are not qualified to succeed from their own merit. let's say you are an american and you

'don't be such a special snowflake'. i personally don't understand the whole 'xzhe, xzher' thing myself and don't consider myself to be a sjw. but i do believe in standing up for what i believe. i also believe that i am not making a 'big deal' over nothing, or blowing things out of proportion. i have personally witness korean international students fall into depression and self harming due to racism. some of which, had decided to go back to korea rather than continuing them study. i don't think this is a 'small deal'. my parents own a shop in a minority asian part of town. for the first decade or so, they have been targeted due to their race fortunately the neighbor are now very much welcoming of us and are mostly very pleasant! asian people are fetishized. you guys probably know what i mean already. the notion that asian females are 'submissive' 'meek' 'eager to please' 'tighter' are all very sick. asian guys are emasculated. i guess if statistic shows that on average, asian guys are smaller in certain areas, i can't really argue with that. but they aren't less of a man because of that alone. i'm going to be 100 honest. i'm a very feminine guy so i can't really give personal examples for this one. but i have seen quite a bit of my korean acquaintances get rejected on the sole grounds of being asian. i'm not stating that asians have it the worst. i'm not stating that asian people aren't racists themselves. i'm stating that there are racism against asian people that people of other race might not consider racist when they really are. please. don't say 'well asian people are the most racist people i know so ' yea, my mom's super racist.",I believe that racism towards asians in the US is not as big a deal as it is made out to be.,"u eli1323 op has awarded 1 delta in this post. all comments that earned deltas from op or other users are listed here r deltalog comments 87y7ul , in r deltalog. please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal or that the conversation has ended. delta system explained deltaboards","i don't know what you mean by 'racism', but i think it's important to remember that asian people are not the only race in the world. there are many other races that are more successful than asians. for example, japanese people are more likely to be successful than chinese people. there is also the fact that asians are less likely to commit crimes. this is because asians don't commit crimes, they commit crimes because of their culture.","i don't think it's fair to say that asians are more successful and smart than other races. i think that's a good thing, but it's not the same as saying that black people are less successful than white people. there are plenty of black people in the world that are successful, but there are also plenty of asian people who are poor and poor, and there are a lot of asians who are successful.","i'm not sure if this is a good thing or not, but i think it's important to remember that asian people are very different from chinese, japanese, and korean people. there are a lot of different ethnicities, races, and ethnicities that are distinct from each other. for example, if you were born in the us, you would be born in china. if you're born in japan, you are born in a chinese country"

 The future of humanity is NOT in outer space,"i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system? well, first let's consider our reasons for colonizing these planets in the first place. most of these planets are either too hot or too cold to sustain life, with the most likely exception being mars, venus, and a number of moons, including our own. even so, these planets present incredibly hostile environments; they are home to extreme temperatures, little to no oxygen, and most likely no liquid water whatsoever. there are theories as to how we might be able to terraform these planets, making it possible for humans to survive there, although needless to say that won't be an easy process. while there is little doubt earth is becoming less habitable to humans, the reality is we currently have water, oxygen, food, plant life, and temperatures humans can survive in almost everywhere on the planet. if it is possible to terraform an environment which is as hostile as mars or venus, shouldn't it also be possible to re terraform earth? wouldn't this be much easier, and a much more productive use of our resources? so perhaps we don't need to colonize other planets, but they are still home to a number of resources that we can benefit from here on earth, right? maybe we can simply set up mining stations throughout our solar system, and bring minerals back to earth. the problem with this is that inter planar travel costs a lot of resources as it is. transporting mining equipment and mining staff to another planet, and transporting a significant quantity valuable minerals back to earth would be extremely cost inefficient. admittedly we would also be granted access to entire planets worth of raw materials, so some might argue that the trade off is ultimately worth it, but keep in mind that we would also need to burn enormous amounts of fuel, and since we currently depend primarily on fossil fuels, we most likely wouldn't be able to find anything of comparable value anywhere else in the solar system. remember that we are currently facing the risk of running out of fossil fuels entirely, and that they are, as the name suggests, made of organic material. with this in mind, it is almost impossible that we will find anything like it elsewhere in our solar system. like i said at the beginning, this is a massive bummer, and i truly hope i'm wrong. i do not have a background in science, and there is a good chance i don't know what i'm talking about, so if you are able to change my view, i would be extremely happy. that being said, if i'm right, i believe the scientific community would be better off recognizing this hard truth, and dedicating their resources to something more productive than space travel, such as researching ways to make the earth continue to be inhabitable."," The future of humanity is NOT in outer space : i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system?

 Weed is bad for you. Smoking it has many short and long term consequences.,"everyone likes to argue that it's not as bad as other drugs but it still can be very psychologically addictive and damaging. smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes which society has agreed are bad for you so why does everyone pretend that this is ok? everyday it seems i can find new studies that have more and more downsides to marijuana smoke in the short and long term and i just don't understand why people seem to think that there are no downsides here. medicinally it still is considered to have no medical benefits and i don't really see how it possibly could as current understanding of thc which is the strongest known cannabinoid in marijuana seems to cause more harm then good. i can understand that cbd is being shown to be successful in treating things like chronic pain and anxiety however thc vastly outnumbers cbd in weed and smoking to get these effects seems counterproductive. i feel as if medical marijuana companies are trying to piggyback off the false notion that it's a harmless drug and push it onto people asap similarly to how tobacco companies operated back in the day. at the end of the day these companies are profitable off addiction and they have ulterior motives when it comes to testing this stuff. they say things like it's not as bad as alcohol or tobacco cigarette but to me this seems like a logical fallacy as one could really justify any reckless behavior this way. one of the main reasons i've been so torn up on this lately is that a lot of my friends including my girlfriend started smoking and have definitely changed. it bothers me. it bothers me that they started presumingly under age and were not fully aware of the consequences and now a lot seem to have dependencies on the drug. they claim it's fine but in my eyes it's the same as smoking as cigarette, at least in the physical sense, and if people smoke tobacco to unwind most people would agree that it's very unhealthy to form habits around that. at the end of the day, smoking every once in a while won't kill you in the same way occasionally smoking a cig won't kill you, however i believe that having a dependency on anything is not healthy and weed is no exception."," Weed is bad for you.

article to another person? but why link a 2007 article over the newest one? although it does have similarity to the other article with cons. it newly states that marijuana has never been proved to be linked to lung cancer, and that a link hasnt been found. they say thats due to limited time for research. because its illegal on a federal lvl research is hard to come by until recently. it also states that in animal research there are things in marijuana that might actually fight tumor growth, but further research is needed. and people have actually used weed to help cancer. which supposedly worked in this young child, that was given suppliments to try to fight cancer. i would link this but im drunk and jus chillin and its gonna take awhile. i dont think weed cures cancer, especially if you smoke it, but i think its possible that it did something to help this girl. i personally only use a vaporizer, and drink very rarely. heres the part where i kinda support part of your argument, weed can be very addictive and is totally a gateway drug. although the other than weed and alcohol iv just tried xanax ones or twice. xanax is powerful, dangerous, not in a psychedelic way, but in a ruins your life and you forget everything tired depressed way. but ever since iv started smoking weed the habit only gets bigger, now its pretty much daily, every night before i go to sleep i always chill w a quick smoke, always vaporizing, which release no tar like smoking does. it only heats the thc and cbd to a temperature where it is active, kinda what they do to make weed ready for edibles, before adding it to the mixture. there are many studies showing that the smokes chemicals and tar excretion from vaporizing is significantly less from just regularly smoking weed like in a joint. and when weed is smoked through a water pipe bong some of the tar and carcinogens are removed through the water. i digress, i kinda wish i never started smoking, its a nessesity that i spend a good amount of money on and that makes me happy. i want to do most things high, and pretty much always smoke if i got weed. and i always can get some so i always buy some. i am noted as an extremely intelligent person, weird wording but me and all my siblings have gone to ivy league schools harvard, standford etc i am not trying to flex, but because i started generally young, i feel that smoking weed has limited my potential. i think if i stopped for a long period of time, my great memory would come back, but come on did i ever have a great memory or do i just think i had a better one. sometimes i take a week break to reset tolerance a bit, or if i really need to focus on something, out of weed etc but i always have the intention to start again in a week and always do. its pretty much impossible to break the cycle because why the fuck would i break the cycle. smoking weed is just, great sometimes. its not meth its not coke, but it can really let you appreciate life, especially music. its not too late for me, i hope. i dont fit in with stoners, or dealers. i fit in with smart sober people. when im sober. when im high im just a responsible guy whos tryna smoke because everything fucking sucks. im sorry for the rant, im pretty sure iv been writing this for over around 45 minutes. what if this post was archived or some shit and i just wasted all that fucking time lmfaoooo please nooooo. i wonder if any of this even makes sense. dont start smoking. its not good for you, and in my opinion somehow extremely addictive, without being addictive at all. the analogy i always use is, weeds like pizza for pizza lovers , its good as fuck. its not nicotine, or opiods. it just tastes good, or feels good. and you kinda want it, when your sad, when your happy, when your bored, when your in a great mood. pizza could just make life fucking great if we could eat it all the time without gaining weight. well some people see the possibly negative effects because weight gain is visible but weed abuse isnt. if i could eat pizza all day any day. i truly would cause that shit is great. and although weed so far isnt a gateway drug for me. you'll start w it and move on to something else especially if its offered to you. acid overall isnt horrible, it isnt addictive and most people take it to have a crazy trip extremely rarely, others take it every weekend, but that is the low 1 or less. coke, meth, heroin, crack, are some of the worst most addictive terrible things in the word, they are pure man made chemicals, that fuck up your appearance not really coke but the others yes , and are so extremely addictive that you literally need them. immediatly. while molly mdma and acid are on the safer side. xanax and alcohol are very similar to weed, alcohols more addictive and definetly impairs driving way more than weed. but never drive with any drug in system. xanax is the most addictive and most dangerous. its a legal prescribed medicine that you can overdose on like every thing iv mentioned except weed and it completely changes personality and destroys memory and emotions. i need to stop writing damn. goodnight bro. i hope you read this, please argue w me","i'm going to take a different approach. i'm not going to try and change your view, but i want to say that i think it's important to note that it's not as bad as smoking cigarettes. i

 The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive.,"what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies."," The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive. : what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies.",I believe that we should tax the rich and give the money to the poor.,"it increases the price, but not be nearly as much as you apparently think it is and not really a cyclical problem as you've suggested either. basic economic principles means that the government paying x for everyone's college would raise the price of college somewhere between 0 and x depending on the elasticity of supply and demand how consumers and providers choose to respond to price changes . the fact that the government doesn't offer financial aid to everyone is just going to make the price rise that much closer to the 0 end of things. but consumers as a whole will never be worse off if the government offers to pay for some college expenses. suppose widgets sell for 25 and the government comes along and offers everyone a free 10 if they buy a widget, so now it only costs people 15. suppose each person has an internal value for how much they are willing to buy a widget for. people who were willing to pay 25 were already buying widgets. people who aren't willing to pay even 15 will continue to not buy widgets. and anyone paynig between 15 25 will now buy widgets and claim the government money. the widget maker can respond to this in a number of ways. they could start producing more widgets to serve the people who are willing to pay 15 25. or they could raise their prices to up to 35 and get the whole 10 for themselves but get none of the benefit of additional sales. the only case in which they'd probably do the second one is if there is a strictly limited supply and making more just isn't really an option. why can't they raise the price above 35? well they would sell even less than they were originally and that isn't how sellers respond to things. as they make more money per sale they make more, not less. here is a more visual explanation of how the supply and demand curves respond to a subsidy like this one. unless the supply curve is vertical, meaning they just don't respond to changes in price by offering just as many spots no matter the price they can get and no new colleges opening up offering classes either when the price increases , then the consumer will also benefit from the subsidy. the overall price for consumers will be cheaper. but with a selective subsidy you can have some consumers hurt a little . the base price won't increase by as much as if everyone got the subsidy, but for anyone not getting the subsidy, they could end up paying a little more then before the subsidy.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'bailing them out'. if you mean 'let them do whatever they want' then i'm going to agree with you. however, i think you're misinterpreting what the government is doing. the government has no right to dictate to the people that they can and cannot do what they want. it's not like the government can dictate what they can or cannot do. it is the government's responsibility to make sure that the people","the problem is that the government doesn't have the power to force universities to do what they want. they can't force colleges to do whatever they want, but they can force them to do it. it's not a matter of government giving money to universities at the rate they want it to, it's about the government making sure that they do what it wants.",tax the rich and give the money to the poor.

found that men are more likely to not be turned off by an overly interested woman in their first meeting while woman are more likely to be turned off by an overly interested man in their first meeting. this makes sense. woman are more likely to be victims of gendered violence and harassment and are pretty much told from a young age to be wary of overly interested men whom are strangers in this study . 2nd source: someone who is arrogant and manipulative, and willing to be so, is more likely to have more sex, volk's team found. well nah shit. people who manipulate people are going to be able to have more one night stands. you do realise the person being manipulated does not realise they are being manipulated. this invalidates your point completly. manipulates pretend to be great people. that is the point. they found that regardless of gender, teens with low humility honesty readings were more likely to bully and to use that bullying as a strategy to have more sex. so they manipulate and bully someone into sex or a relationship. so the victim here the person being bullied clearly isn t making a choice. this study completly invalidates your points. bad people manipulate pretend to be good people and bully partners into sex. 3rd source: however, bullying may be an effective behavior primarily for adolescents who possess personality traits that make them willing and able to use bullying as a strategy for obtaining sexual partners. same as the previous one. bad people either manipulate pretend to be nice or bully their partner into sex. this is not willing. this is not a choice. clearly if they have to manipulate or bully someone into sex then the partner isn t choosing based off bad traits they are either being forced or they believe the person has good traits. both these studies say there is no gender split. the same results occur with females and males. 4th source: this is an artical reporting on your 3rd source. are you reading your sources? are you just reading headlines? 5th source:link is broken for me. 6th source:this is another artical reporting on your 3rd and 4th source. please read your sources. why are you quoting sources and not reading them? 7th source: this is another artical about a study you have already quoted. this is an artical about your 1st source. 8th source:firstly, this is about short term relationship. it is about how men are able to manipulate read: pretend to have nice traits women for short term sex. narcissism and psychopathy are about short term charm and short term manipulation. this does not support your point at all. this shows that woman prefer nice traits. it shows that some men know woman prefer nice traits and use this to manipulate them. the traits of the prefered man are: the manipulation, exploitation, deceit and flattery of others; a lack of remorse, morality concerns and sensitivity, and cynicism. you do not realise when you are getting manipulated or exploitation. that is the point of them. you do not realised whem you are getting decited. that is the point. this study completly goes agaisnt what you say. the obvious conclusion is that to sleep with women men pretend to be nice guys. they pretend to have nice traits. woman fall for this. because they want nice traits. these men can only keep up the lie so long. after the lie and thus the nice traits stop the relationship stops as well. 9th source: i am going to put this in all caps because i do not understand why you have done this so many times. is it to inflate the number of sources you have so it seems more real? is it because you thought no one would read your sources? this is another source reporting on a source you have already posted. 10th source:this study admits itself that they do not think it is fully complete and they don t want to make conclusions. a key point of narcissism is manipulation. again, bad people pretending to be good people. 11th source: oh great. it starts off with a bloggers opinion. i m going to compeltly ignore the begining on some random person s opinions and skip to where they quote a study. i mean i m sure you won t mind since you didn t even read the sources. the study involves data extracted from the internet. great. no one lies on the internet for attention. no one pretends on the internet. and it was based on web searches, posts, and erotica. that is solid. none of that is exaggerated at all. i mean, when i look into what attracts men i just look up the most popular video on pornhub and conclude that is what all men are attracted to 100 of the time 100 of men. yep. oh, super. the data collected is so vaired that you could draw two completly different conclusions on it. by the way, ted bundy dod recieve letters from a large amount of women read: a couple hundred at most . he was a psychopath. he was manipulative. do we need to talk about what manipulative people do? they don t tell people they are manipulative. wanna know who recieve thousands and thousands and millions of letters and fans? boy bands. all of whom have an uptight, nice, gentleman like attitude. 12th source:1st, are you really really really legitmatly sourcing an anonymous blog post on incels. men who wish cancer on women, men who wish rape on women, men who degrade women and call them feminoids , men who expect sex. shouldn t they, according to you, be recieving sex? they are horribly degrading and disgusting people. shouldn t, according to you, women be falling head over heels for them? why aren t they? 2nd, i am not going to trust an ed out blog post of several studies. that is not a legitmate source. link the actual studies. oh look. look what we have here linked as a source. a source you have already linked stop repeating sources it does not make anything more legitmate. so in conclusion. you only have maybe 5 sources here of different studies. nearly all refute your point since it is about manipulation. the one that isn t about manipulation is about woman worrying about manipulation. do you have any sources that support the point you are making? if not, why do you believe your point despite there being no evidence?","i'm not sure what your view is, but i think it's important to note that you're assuming that 'nice guys' and 'narcissists' are the same thing. that's not necessarily the case. in fact,

the answer requires acceptance of the premises explained above that:1. this life is not all. 2. this life is the means to an end, which end is joy in the presence of god. 3. god provided a way that all that is unfair in this life can be made right in an eternal perspective. 4. the suffering we experience in this life intimately helps us to grow and progress this progression is essential in an eternal perspective. specifically, depending on which judeo christian religion you ask about children that die, you ll get different answers. here s the answer that makes sense to me given the above premises:children and innocents who suffer and die early in this life will have everything made right in the next life. babies that die go to heaven. in summary, you can reconcile the suffering that takes place in this world and the statement that god loves his children if you believe in the statements above. even if you don t believe in the statements, you can still accept that this is how those who do believe in god reconcile believing that he loves them with the suffering in the world.","i'm not going to change your view, but i'm going to try to address your first point. 1. if god is omnipotent and omniscient, then why does god have to be omnipotent? 2. if we removed the number of children that died at the hands of another human, the number would still be massive, in our context as humans. 3. i'm sorely disappointed in the lack of butts in your inbox, shame on you cmv readers.","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i think it's important to realize that there are a lot of people who believe in a loving god, and there are many people who do not. i think the best way to approach this is to look at how the world works. for example, let's say that there is a god who is omnipotent and omniscient, and he loves us. let's assume that this god is omniscience, and that","i'm not sure what you mean by 'proof' or 'proof'. i think you're looking at it from the perspective of someone who doesn't believe in god. i'm not going to try to change your view, but i would like to point out that the number of children that die every year in the world is proof that god exists. it's not that there's no god, it's that there are people who believe that there is no god."

" The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason.","a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident."," The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason. : a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident.","I believe that a senate that is elected in this waywarts the will of the people,","although the eu is not a federation or structured in the same way as the united states, it s certainly reasonable to draw parallels. for the us, each state is partially sovereign, but also a part of the overall federation. they are granted representatives in two ways. one way is weighted based on the population of its member states. that s the house of representatives. the other is based on the virtue of being a state. prior to the creation of the the federal government, each state made a conscious agreement to join based on different contingencies. the more populated states have more of a voice in the federal government. but the less populated states would not have been incentivized to join if their voice was almost entirely drowned out by other states with larger populations. so they came up with the connecticut compromise to make an adjustment so that those less populated states had both representation based on population and the virtue of being a state. now, although again it s not a perfect parallel, 4 countries make up 50 of the population of the eu. if germany, france, uk, and italy had more similar interests than the other 24 and voted solely based on population, they could enact policies that harm the other 86 of member states. the us federal government is set up in a way where this won t happen. more populated states still get louder voices, but the representation of the states is corrected to a fair way that their membership was predicated on. more populous states have their representation corrected downwards, less populated states have their membership corrected upwards, but the rank order of the representation of all states still falls perfectly in line with their population. and they all agreed to this, again due to the weight of their population and the virtue of being a state. it would be entirely unfair to backtrack and revise the structure of representation without giving the delawares and wyomings and north dakotas the choice to leave the federation.","i don't think this is a good idea. it's a bad idea because it would make it harder for the people to vote for a president who has a lot of power over the people. i think it would be better if the people of the united states were able to vote on the president they want to elect. i don't know if this is the best way to do it, but i think this would be a great idea.","the senate is a collection of states. it's not just about the size of the states, it's about the number of people in each state. if you want to abolish the senate, you have to abolish it.","i don't think it's a good idea to have a senate that is elected in this way. it's not a perfect system, but it's better than the current system, and it's more effective than it's been in the past."

 Pascal's Wager is ultimately meaningless because it ignores the existence of other religions.,"arguments for the belief in a god or gods fascinate me, but none have ever really made me question my agnosticism as much as pascal's wager. amp;

 Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control. Forgiving this shows lack of self respect.,"i noticed that cheating has been normalized especially with people of color poc in the media and in real life. it's sexist if you ask me. let me first define cheating. cheating is telling your partner you won't be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship, but still doing it. it's not considered cheating to me if it's an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot. also, when talking of relationships, i mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them. i don't want to hear of forced marriages, abusive relationships, or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what i'm thinking about. if the passion has died in your relationship, it is better to break off the relationship. i don't mean divorce though cause i know that involves money and can be messy, but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least. to me, if you cheat that means you don't love your so. if you really love your so and understand the pain it would cause them, you wouldn't consider cheating. if your so is having problems sexually and you cheat, that's basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared. there's also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue. and if it's that big of a deal and unsolvable, you can move on to an open relationship or seperate break up. people who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship and or the emotional support they felt in the relationship. i feel when people take back people who cheat, it's because they don't feel they'll ever find anyone to replace what they had which can be a valid point, but still sad desperate . imo i feel it's a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that. i feel this all makes perfect sense, but it's like the older i get the more people are acting like i'm living in fantasy land. beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women. great men are taking back women who cheat too. what's going on?"," Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control.

people consistently undervalue is that while cheating is a horrible thing to do to a person, it doesn't necessarily disregard the entire history that two people may have shared together. i've seen several older couples that find out one of the people cheated over decades. to be sure, once that knowledge is out, the relationship is forever changed. also note, that there was a huge discrepancy in the two people's understandings of what the relationship was to begin with. one person thought they were both being faithful, the other spent a significant amount of energy hiding some amount of their activities from their partner. once cheating becomes known, the relationship cannot be what it was, because it wasn't what it was claiming to be before that point anyway. to get back to why someone might forgive a cheater and it's ok: have you tried dating people? 90 of the people you will find in the dating pool are just not a good match for you, and a significant portion of those people are just not ready for a meaningful relationship to begin with. comparing that to a partner who cheated, in a simple pros cons format, will often place the cheater on the better side of the comparison, even with the huge 'cheated on me' con. the relationship likely had many positives before the cheating was known, and most of those positives haven't changed. ie: if the partner was worth staying with before the cheating and actively making the subjects life better, then once the cheating is known, they aren't making the subjects life as good as they once were, but it's still a net positive. going back to the older couples, sometimes it just isn't worth it to go back into the dating pool, you simply don't have enough time left in this world for it to be worth it. you might argue that is because they are showing less self respect, but i would argue that is merely accepting the facts of life. the world is what it is and you can do a simple math analysis on how many years it takes to get to a point of trust with a person. clearly, a cheater has ruined a significant amount of trust, especially physical intimacy, but relationships are about a lot more than that, and a truly sorry cheater can spend the rest of their years how many years is that anyway? making it up to their partner. not a very romantic solution, but definitely a situation that favors the forgiver. you mentioned the financial aspects of a relationship, and cheating actually has basically 0 impact on that. i once sat in a psychology class having to write an argument about the phrase 'those who marry for money get all that they deserve' and my only critique on the statement was 'why are the words 'for money' in that sentence? those who marry get all that they deserve, it doesn't matter what your reasons are, if you marry purely for love, you're just as big a fool' maybe the love is gone, maybe they aren't a really big fan of their partner personally, but the financial aspects of the marriage mean their whole life is fairly easy as long as they don't separate, or in some cases, initiate separation. this can, again, be a net positive. sometimes, people are just punishing themselves or whatever by keeping a cheater, but a lot of the time, it's not so much forgiving the cheater for cheating as much as acknowledging that life is just better by keeping them, even though it will never be as good as it might have seemed. that might sound depressing, but i've seen it in action. i've seen someone leave a cheater, only to come back 4 years later because things just weren't working out, and life with a cheater is better than what it was without the cheater. easy decision to make from that perspective. typo's and stuff, at this point i'm done.","i don't think it's fair to say that cheating is a bad thing. it's not like you're saying that it's okay to cheat, but it's that you're not okay with it. if you're ok with it, then it's fine. but if you don't like it, you shouldn't do it. and if you do, then that's fine, but that's not the same as cheating.","i think it's a bit of a semantic issue, but i'd like to address the main point of your post. you seem to be conflating two very different things. firstly, i think you're confusing 'cheating' with'self control'. i'm not sure what you mean by self control, but it's important to note that the definition of self control varies from person to person. if you're talking about a person who cheats on their partner, then","i think it's a bit of a stretch to say that a relationship is better than a relationship without cheating. if you're in a relationship with someone you love, then it's better to break up than to continue the relationship with them."

 School success is (not) a measure of intelligence or future success,"school education traditionally relies upon rote learning, rote memory, and rote tasking. this means 'retaining' large amounts of factual information without needing to understand it. a school pupil student can tell you that milk and calcium helps our bones to grow strong, but that is about as far as their understanding goes. they generally won't have a deep profound understanding of nutrition, nor would they get critical with what they are supposedly learning. to say that it does has always been a big fat lie pushed by academics in the west. as a grown adult, i certainly know the difference between learning abstractly and learning by rote. the difference to me is a fundamental one. abstract learning demands constant critical thought, the application of logic to an idea, such as that you must always make sure that you have carefully removed the errors from your work. 'logic' is about being as 'consistent' as possible with your thoughts, ideas and theories. this is hard, time consuming mental work and that's how you know when you're challenging your brain. and how dare psychologists reduce intelligence to basic memory skills just because it fits nicely with their agenda of academic supremacy. it is offensive to the human species! humans, at least the intelligent and creative ones, are much more capable than what psychologists give us crfor! yuck! also, 'success' is naturally a subjective matter because we don't all strive to accomplish the exact same things. academic success, as we know it, is morbid to many people. suicide in young people between 15 and 24 is on the rise! nobody should be telling anybody else what they should or should not be accomplishing! if anyone here can construct a well reasoned argument, i'll definitely be waiting, thank you"," School success is (not) a measure of intelligence or future success : school education traditionally relies upon rote learning, rote memory, and rote tasking. this means 'retaining' large amounts of factual information without needing to understand it. a school pupil student can tell you that milk and calcium helps our bones to grow strong, but that is about as far as their understanding goes. they generally won't have a deep profound understanding of nutrition, nor would they get critical with what they are supposedly learning. to say that it does has always been a big fat lie pushed by academics in the west. as a grown adult, i certainly know the difference between learning abstractly and learning by rote. the difference to me is a fundamental one. abstract learning demands constant critical thought, the application of logic to an idea, such as that you must always make sure that you have carefully removed the errors from your work.

Capitalism is a better economic system than Socialism,"this is crucial to keep growing a stronger economy and helps goods become cheaper than they would be under a socialist government. my problems

in the United States.,"the assumption here is that competition keeps society moving, that it s what fuels scientific innovation and all. however, it does not. rather it halts innovation, and we get stuck with shitty versions of technology that could be. for example, part of the cause of the great depression was that goods in the us were being made too well. they lasted too long without needing replacement, so eventually, business halted and people lost their jobs, as a result, goods have to be produced more shittily to keep business up. under capitalism, production requires financial incentive. when there s no financial incentive, things aren t made. then there s imperialism, which is the only logical extension of capitalism. growing capitalism needs more and more markets. it s a self destructive system that will always either fall to shit and be replaced or heavily modified with government safety nets, and when it withstands crumbling of being overthrown, it s maintained through military means or extreme human rights violations. if a society with the technology and infrastructure of somewhere like the us were to transition to a socialist society, education would be far more accessible, as would food and housing empty houses outnumber homeless people here and society would function more efficiently because everyone would have adequate food and shelter, at the very least. then more people would be able to pursue medicine or astronomy or engineering and better society instead of having to work late night retail shifts for years.","i think the problem with

 The Term ‘LGBTQIA+’ is Actively Harmful Towards the Cause it Tries to Support Because it Drives Away Potential Supporters for Being... Too Much.,"let me explain what i mean by this. i recently came across an ad for the democratic party in which people in regular clothes held up cardboard placards with the group or cause they were advocating for written on them. women s rights , racial equality , etc. what i found particularly eyecatching was a young man who said, i support the lgbtqa community , or the like. at that statement, i cringed. before i say anything else, i want to mention that i am by no means homophobic i have friends who are gay, how could i possibly be homophobic? i support equality for all, and find it ridiculous that in 2018 we still come to an agreement as a nation what consists a marriage, and what is equality. that said, i believe there is absolutely no need to add the two three new categories to the already wordy phrase, as if trying to say that people who fall under those categories were not already represented with lgbt, and especially q: intersex, asexual, and allies who are heterosexual . i have voiced my concerns in the past about how the term feminist may possibly have an adverse effect because those who are already colored to believe that presently the two sexes are equal enough already are going to reject the term, believing the term to mean what it does not: advocacy for the supremacy of the female gender, above the male. i have since recinded that argument, partly because i believe now that to force society to change certain aspects of revolutionary concepts need to be superlatively termed to give them the attention they need, and partly because i am a man and it s really really difficult to say the above to a well concerning woman. in the case of lgbtqia , i ask again what is gained by the addition of three extra categories? lesbian, gay, and transgender are self explanatory. bisexual i had trouble in the past because as a heterosexual man i could not comprehend why those who are both homo and heterosexual would want a whole different category to describe them in advocacy, but i ve come around to accept the notion that they are different from lgt. i did not exactly know what queer meant until a few years ago when that term was added into the already existing lgbt , and the way it was explained to me was they represent all of those sexual minorities who are neither heterosexual or transgender, a sort of umbrella term to make sure that nobody is left unrepresented. what would the addition of those who are asexual or intersexed, and hetero but supporting address exactly? let me say, in my opinion, what the addition does . it creates further confusion for those who are on the fence about the issues of gender and sex. it makes the group less appealing to stand for if you were already against the movement wait, you re telling me they added another category of people?"," The Term ‘LGBTQIA+’ is Actively Harmful Towards the Cause it Tries to Support Because it Drives Away Potential Supporters for Being...

 I think capitalism favours crony capitalism.,"laws, regulations, subsidies, and so on affect the exchange of private property. politicians therefore are a service that can help private actors in gaining profit. this service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped my mind. unfortunately i don't know what would convince me, but because this cmv is theoretical, i will accept theoretical arguments."," I think capitalism favours crony capitalism. : laws, regulations, subsidies, and so on affect the exchange of private property. politicians therefore are a service that can help private actors in gaining profit. this service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped my mind. unfortunately i don't know what would convince me, but because this cmv is theoretical, i will accept theoretical arguments.",I believe that politicians are just people who can buy votes.,why would investors inject their money into a corrupt market when better markets exist?,i think you're missing a big part of the problem here. politicians are a service. they are not the only service that can help private actors in gaining profit.,"the profit motive under capitalism favours the commodification of politics. the profit motive is a service that can help private actors in gaining profit. this service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped your mind. this is the same way that low entropy is favoured in closed systems. i don't know what would convince you, because you will accept theoretical arguments.",i'm not sure if this is a good argument or not but i think it's important to keep in mind that politicians aren't just people who can buy votes. politicians are people who are elected by their constituents. they are people that are elected through their votes.

Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law,"my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law : my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.",I think abortion should be 100% legal everywhere.,are miscarriages manslaughter?,"i think you're conflating two different things. the first is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. the second is that a fetus is not a living thing. it's not a person, it's a human being. if you want to have a child, you need to be able to do so.","i think the problem with roe v wade is that it was based on the idea that the fetus was not a human being. if the fetus is not a person, then there is no way to determine whether or not it is a person. if a fetus is a living thing, then it is not morally wrong to kill it.","i'm not sure if you've heard of roe v wade, but i think you're missing the point. roe was a case of the law being wrong. it's not about whether a fetus is alive or not, it's about whether or not it's a human being. if a fetus isn't a living thing, then it shouldn't be able to reproduce. if you're saying that the government should pay for birth control, then you're making the argument that"
" Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral","you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter? no matter how real it looks, it isn't . it may look uncomfortable to some people to see what looks like themselves in vulgar scenes, but just because something is uncomfortable to look at to some, does not mean it is inherently immoral. 2. you don't own the image of your face. every day you willingly give it away by walking in public or posting selfies of yourself online. this is especially true for celebrities. it's almost their job to make their appearance as widely known as possible. and even if you don't, you're not entitled to 'own' illustrations of yourself like a copyrighted piece of art anyway, at least not by default. it's human nature for people to remember how other people look and picture them in their heads, even in thoughts such as sexual fantasies. and if that's okay then i don't understand why it's not okay to just copy these thoughts into a tangible format such as an illustration. 3. technology is ever improving, and faked imagery is only going to get more realistic and easy to produce. i'm sure last century there were people equally offended by faked porn that would to our eyes look ridiculously bad and unrealistic. fakes are here to stay, and we need to adapt our sense of morality to reflect this reality. i believe this will happen and such images will get normalized sooner or later either way, but i think it would be in everyone's interest to just get it over with and make it sooner rather than later."," Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral : you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter?

 Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords.,"by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name? ' , then that is almost certainly easier to guess than it would be to guess their password. the overall security is reduced. instead of forcing password restrictions, users should have the freedom to choose a password as 'strong' or as 'weak' as they wish. inform the users when they are making their account how strong their passwords are, and give recommendations. but at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion. cmv!"," Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords. : by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name?

their race and sexuality are irrelevant. however, politically, all of these people range from center left to far left. i have never worked with a conservative professionally, because they either don't want to go into my field or don't make the cut. there is no ideological litmus test that stops conservatives from becoming scientists. they're not being persecuted. they just don't make it. part of the issue is that conservatism in the modern american form holds some very stupid ideas that repel intelligent people who have a wide range of life experiences. for example, anyone who goes to college for several years is likely to have at least a few gay friends and want them to be happily married if they so choose. it's hard for someone who knows several gays as normal people who want to live normal lives to be afraid of them getting married or see it as a threat; that view can come only from unfamiliarity and or fervent belief in a self contradictory book of ancient fables. conservatism is also closely associated with several anti science views and policy actions, including rejecting evolution and denying the existence of anthropogenic climate change. people intelligent enough to become scientists are very unlikely to hold those conservative views. likewise, scientists are likely to have traveled quite a bit for research and to conferences, and to have lived in several different places; all of these things provide some exposure to other cultures and reduce the fear of other cultures, or of mixing of cultures, that's implicit in mainstream conservative positions on issues like immigration. if you were to insist that teams of scientists must have political views proportional to those of the country at large basically affirmative action for political views you'd have to reach for completely unqualified people to fill the conservative spots, and they'd have nothing to do but sit around picking their noses. conservatism in general rarely imbues somebody with ideas that make them valuable for any task, and certainly not in the way a different measure of diversity of knowledge such as college major does. there is certainly a role for center right conservatives, or at least for centrists, in opposing the occasional excesses of the far left. i would like to see a reasonable, good faith opposition to the far left as a moderating force in our politics. but conservatives who fit that mould are pretty rare.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'diversity.'i think you're conflating a group of muslims with a board of white, men, women, and whatever else inbetween that all have leftist opinions.",diversity of beliefs and thoughts is not the same thing as diversity of identity.,i'm not sure what you mean by 'diversity of thought'. diversity of thought is more important than diversity of opinion.

he repents at the end, but i would say satan won the bet here. furthermore, job is obviously right in saying that he is punished through no fault of his own, and therefore unfairly. he never explains how his action was fair, apparently because 'god works in mysterious ways' tm and no human could ever understand. except we can, it's right there, black on white, in the beginning: god punished job to prove a point to satan, and if people can't grasp the reasons for their suffering, they are probably either nonexisting or preposterous as they are in the case of job . basically the take away seems to be that sometimes, god is just a bully. phew, sorry about the rant, really needed to get this off my chest. anyways, i know that there are much more knowledgeable people than me in this sub, so i hope you can show me where i've completely missed the point which is probably the case and tell me why i'm wrong!",the story of job is a disempowering piece of literature,"the story of job illustrates the idea that it's just as important or even more so to stick to your morals in hard times as it is in good times. it also demonstrates kanye's age old axiom, 'to whom much is given, much is tested. '","i think it's important to remember that the bible is written by a man who is not a man. he is a man, and he is the only one who is capable of understanding the laws of the universe. it's not that he can't understand the laws, it's that he is incapable of understanding them.","i think the book of job is a good example of a book that has a lot to teach its religious audience. for example, the bible is a great book about how the world works. the book is also a great example of how the bible can be used as a tool to teach people about the world. it's also a good book about the history of the world, and it's a good way to learn about how to live in a world where you don't have to be","i think the problem with the book is that it's not a religious text. it's a philosophical text. the bible is a collection of stories, and it's very much about theodicy. the book has a lot of interesting insights, but it doesn't really address any of the important theological questions. for example, the israelites are taught time and again that they have turned away from god and sinned. they are led to believe, convinced by prophets send by god"
 I believe that it is both a waste of resources and unjustifiably selfish to have children in these times. I would go so far as to say it’s immoral.,"i got into an argument with someone over my opinion today, and they weren t able to articulate a convincing counter argument so i m wondering if one of you might be able to. my thinking is thus: we are living in an era of upheaval and political unrest all around the globe. we are just beginning to feel the effects of global warming and climate change, and in the years to come the effects will become even more dramatic. the planet is overpopulated. and it s been estimated that there are 153 million orphans around the world who need homes. if you simply must have a child, adopt one of the many who need a family. with all that said, what incentive is there for having a biological child? some people want to have a child that shares their dna, that looks like them, that will continue their lineage. and i m sorry, but in my book that s just plain old fashioned selfishness. why do you think you re so special? it s that kind of limited, self centered thinking that has gotten us to a crisis point as a planet. once all the orphans in the world have been adopted, and we ve turned back the clock on global warming and overpopulation, then maybe it ll be acceptable to procreate again. there was a point in human history where we needed to procreate so that the species would survive. now the opposite seems to be true we need to not procreate if we want to survive. i realize this is a very emotional subject for a lot of people. but really, why would you do that when you could adopt a child in need? for the sake of our planet and our species. can someone can come up with a different argument, that can withstand the scrutiny of logic?"," I believe that it is both a waste of resources and unjustifiably selfish to have children in these times.

 I'm Pro-choice.,"first of all sorry for the abortion topic, this is a view that has been beaten to death. i hate read lot of conservative sites like townhall or fedaralist and there is an anti abortion piece in the site almost everyday. it's almost like propaganda to me at this point. yet clear and convincing arguments for abortion is never presented. my anecdotal view of abortion is, if i were to get a genetic kidney disorder i cannot use the government to force my parents to give me their kidneys. without that kidney i would die but that is not the same as my parents killing me. same way a women should not be forced to bear a fetus that is parasitic to her body. without the mothers support the fetus would die but that is not the same as her killing it. until a fetus achieve viability outside the womb a women retains the right to on demand abortion. afterwards restrictions should be put in place like a threat to the mothers health. denying the right to a women her bodily autonomy i believe is a slippery slope. a pregnant women whose food , medication, smoking, alcohol that is harmful to the fetus can be construed as child abuse and pave the road for criminal legislation. i wrote this on my phone so there might be some grammatical errors. cmv"," I'm Pro-choice. : first of all sorry for the abortion topic, this is a view that has been beaten to death. i hate read lot of conservative sites like townhall or fedaralist and there is an anti abortion piece in the site almost everyday. it's almost like propaganda to me at this point. yet clear and convincing arguments for abortion is never presented. my anecdotal view of abortion is, if i were to get a genetic kidney disorder i cannot use the government to force my parents to give me their kidneys. without that kidney i would die but that is not the same as my parents killing me. same way a women should not be forced to bear a fetus that is parasitic to her body. without the mothers support the fetus would die but that is not the same as her killing it. until a fetus achieve viability outside the womb a women retains the right to on demand abortion. afterwards restrictions should be put in place like a threat to the mothers health. denying the right to a women her bodily autonomy i believe is a slippery slope. a pregnant women whose food , medication, smoking, alcohol that is harmful to the fetus can be construed as child abuse and pave the road for criminal legislation. i wrote this on my phone so there might be some grammatical errors. cmv",i believe abortion should be legal but restrictions should be put in place.,"fetuses don't achieve viability outside of the womb even after they are born. humans specifically baby humans are really weak on their own. they need at least one adult to care for them. so should we be able to neglect fetuses after they are born too? most people don't think so. most people consider it wrong to leave a baby in a trash can. the argument against this, that i can imagine, is that someone else can take care of the child after it is born after roughly 6 months of pregnancy. however, why is there a compelling interest to taking care of the child? most people don't want to adopt. why don't we just leave the orphans on the street to fend for themselves? overall, you always have a choice for everything. if i decide to cheat on my wife, that is my choice. if i decide to speed, it's my choice. if i decide to kill someone, that's my choice. the main argument is, is the fetus human alive, is killing something that is human alive wrong? personally i'm fine with killing things. i eat meat, i'm fine with kill shelters, with animal testing etc. however, i value human life. there is a religious reason i have for valuing human life. i believe that humans are made in god's image and that other animals are given to us, with our dominion over them. we shouldn't kill animals recklessly because we have dominion, but it is amoral whether or not an animal dies. however, i think it is moral whether or not a human is killed or not. if you are not religious, then according to the atheistic logic that makes sense to me, you get to define what is right and wrong. so you decide if human lives are moral or not, whether animal lives are moral or not, whether plant lives are moral or not. if you aren't deciding for yourself, then you are deciding from a relativist cultural standpoint i'm assuming you aren't, but i'll cover it just in case . if this is the case, then it is legally acceptable in america and it is something that is hidden. don't ask, don't tell. you only risk cultural shame by mentioning it which is why i'm assuming you aren't talking about relativism .","if you have a genetic kidney disorder, you should be able to opt out of it. if you don't, then you shouldn't be allowed to have an abortion.","note: your thread has not been removed. your post's topic seems to be fairly common on this subreddit. similar posts can be found through our wiki page or via the search function regards, the mods of r changemyview. i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose?

lip service to social issues and being center to center right on foreign policy, wall street regulations, and especially on issues regarding all the money swirling around congress. the hot topic right now is how radical mainstream democrats are and how scary and new that is. mainstream democrats have been moving to the right for decades to appeal to moderates and to pad their pocketbooks, and only recently have started to shift back left when they finally started to realize the were losing more of their base than was being gained in new moderate voters. this isn't new, it's a return to a compromise second approach rather than compromise first, and is more aligned with the largest portions of their base. my point is, i'm still an independent progressive. i could have called myself a member of the democratic party the whole time and been more right than wrong on sheer percentage. hell, i'm probably 70 80 aligned at this point in the shift, at least with the rhetoric, and that's

' incel before 'incel' was really a buzzword. like an incel, he was lonely. like an incel, he felt 'entitled' to a woman. like an incel, he saw fit to punish that woman for being with someone else, even though that woman didn't know he existed. and like an incel, he was very depressed and unhappy with life in general. and like many incels, he eventually ended up killing himself. and what happened? he wasn't seen as some piece of shit like minassian was. bj rk even mourned his passing. because she and many others understood that what he was doing was not acceptable, but his mind was too far gone for him to just stop doing it. amp; x200b; and it wasn't just cho or lopez or aghdam or the columbine kids. there's stack, there's huberty, there's a whole long list of them, who commit extreme unjustified acts, but somehow we're able to see the tortured existence inside. not being able to date bj rk is no reason to actively try and mutilate her. just like not having had sex is no reason to call for the enslavement of all women. but for lopez we understand that while his reasons are unjustified, something's wrong in his head that turns his loneliness into a reason to kill. so why can't we see that in minassian, or rodger, or the many other incels out there? and in aghdam's case, only just slightly before. how did our attitude towards mental health change so drastically between aghdam and minassian?",Incels are suffering from mental illness and should be helped,"when you say 'mental health issues,' are you thinking of any specific disorders? unless you name some depression, schizophrenia, etc or give some guidelines for what counts as mentally ill e. g. obsessing over something to the point that it causes self harm , i think calling someone 'mentally ill' is subjective and can't be debated very well. for example, some extremely religious people think that atheists are mentally ill but that's not a view that most other people would agree with. simply googling 'what is mentally ill' showed me a lot of debate on the topic. here's one of the article","i think it's important to realize that incels aren't just violent misogynists, they are also violent psychopaths. i don't think you can argue that they aren't violent assholes, but i think you're missing the point. they are not inherently violent, they're just people who act in ways that make them feel good about themselves. it's not like you're saying that they don't deserve help, it's just that you think they're selfish assholes.","i don't think it's fair to say that incels are violent misogynists. i think the problem is that they are not violent at all. it's not like they are violent, it's just that they don't have the mental capacity to be violent.","i'm not sure what you mean by incels. i think you're conflating the two. i don't think it's fair to say that the term 'incel' is used to describe a group of people who are in a position of power. it's used to refer to people who have been in power for a long time, but it's now used to mean people who want to be in power. the term incel doesn't mean that they are inherently"

view on this from a different angle. i think you're missing the point of a job. it's not a job, it's a social contract. it doesn't have to be a contract, it has to be an agreement. that's why you want to work. if you're going to work, you'll have to find a job that you like. that way, you don't need to be the breadwinner. you'll be","i'm going to try to change your view, but i think it's important

enjoy. second, you need to understand that you're not the only person who is unhappy with work. many people are unhappy with their jobs because they don"

 Contemporary Feminism is sexist,ok so first of i think of everyone as equal and i don't think any race or gender is better then the rest. it's sexist for both men and woman actually. so they get stuff handed to them. a small example of this is a female adaptation for every movie. if hollywood was truely feminist they would make their own movie with a female lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie. now on the male end of this. so a man can't make a valid point without being called priveleged white scum or what have you. yes i know all men aren't white but you see my point. i truely think it's coming from a good place. however they need to become more self aware and realize they are who they hate. so yeah that's it. change my view, Contemporary Feminism is sexist : ok so first of i think of everyone as equal and i don't think any race or gender is better then the rest. it's sexist for both men and woman actually. so they get stuff handed to them. a small example of this is a female adaptation for every movie. if hollywood was truely feminist they would make their own movie with a female lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie. now on the male end of this. so a man can't make a valid point without being called priveleged white scum or what have you. yes i know all men aren't white but you see my point. i truely think it's coming from a good place. however they need to become more self aware and realize they are who they hate. so yeah that's it. change my view,"i think men are always the ""bad guys"" in society.","the best way that i ve been able to describe modern feminism is with the analogy of a race. normally, everyone begins at the same starting block, and when the gun goes off, everyone goes on a runnin. however, due to inequality, there are very few races in the world that have everyone on equal footing, if they could even be let in to start the race in the first place. in short, some racers don t even get to start at the start. in this specific case, we ll focus on women. the first wave of feminism brought western women up toward the starting line a whole bunch! the right to vote, divorce, etc, moved women s rights forward and gave them more of a fighting chance at equity. however, they still were not starting as far forward as men. next game advancements in attitudes toward female sexuality and reproductive freedom, equality in the workplace, each step bringing women a bit closer to the starting line. however, we are still not there. now, let s tackle modern examples that you ve given, like female representation in the media. this is, to some including me , a comparatively small step forward when it comes to getting to the starting line. however, it is still a step forward. think about it from the prospective of women in this race we see ourselves pushing closer and closer to the starting line, more and more toward equity. some people may see this, however, as their chance at the proverbial first place being threatened. technically, yeah. the more people there are in the game, the more likely someone else will win out. however, this is where i like to make things a bit bigger picture. yes, human nature is self preservation. we want the best for ourselves, and this is not always a bad instinct. however, it s entirely possible to want the best for yourself and want the best for others as well. that is why feminism has also fought to ensure that male rape victims are treated fairly in society and in law, that fathers have an equal chance in custody cases if they choose to pursue it, that men do not suffer from the same generalisations and stereotypes that harm women. i will not deny that every movement has its fringes that must be challenged when they make harmful statements, generalisations, and accusations. feminism is no different. however, it still holds the equity of sexes at its heart, and that means getting everyone to the same starting line. cassini.","i don't think you're making a valid point, but i think it's important to recognize that you're talking about a minority of people, not just a group of people. the problem with this is that it doesn't make sense for the minority to be treated the same as the minority. it's not like the majority of people can't make valid points without being called priveleged white scum or what have you.","feminism is not sexist, it's just a group of people who want to make a point. it's a group that wants to make the point that men are better than women. that's what feminism is about. feminism isn't about making a point about women being better than men. feminism is trying to make sure that men don't have to make that point. that doesn't mean that men aren't good at making that point, it just means that men can't make that","i think you're right that men are always the 'bad guys' in society, but i don't think it's fair to say that men aren't always the bad guys in society. i think the reason why men are the 'good guys' is because they have a higher chance of being the bad guy in society than women."

 It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa,"high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives."," It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa : high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives.",I believe that iq is a stupid measure of intelligence.,"i think that if you join any kind of society for the express purpose of being able to brag about your eligibility, you probably have some insecurity to work through but this is hardly unique to members of mensa. another example that comes to mind is paying to be listed in who's who directories and the like. on the other hand, there are people who join societies like this because they enjoy the activities and social programs therein. many older people in particular, who may be lonely, might look for any kind of group or society they are eligible to join. i've never heard a bragging word leave my elderly neighbor's mouth, but she goes to mensa meetings every week because she likes to simultaneously have human interaction and keep her mind sharp by doing brain games with other people who enjoy them. anytime she mentions mensa, it's usually because she want to share a cool puzzle she got there. in brief: if your motive for joining mensa is to brag, then you have issues with insecurity. but that is not the only reason people join mensa. so i think that to say the organization itself is stupid because a certain subset of its members join only for status is not a tenable argument. societal attitudes toward praising intelligence or other heritable traits is a separate issue entirely, of which certain individuals' mensa membership is at most a byproduct.","i'm not sure if i can change your view, but i think it's important to note that iq is a measure of intelligence. it's not an indicator of intelligence, but it's a measurement of intelligence that can be used to measure a person's intelligence. i'm sure there are people who are smarter than you, but there are also people who aren't as smart as you, and there are plenty of people who have a higher iq than you.","i don't think it's stupid to join a high iq society like Mensa, but i do think it is stupid to be a member of a society that revolves around a mostly genetically inherited and very narrow aspect of intelligence.","i think it's important to note that iq is not a measure of intelligence. it is an indicator of how well you are functioning in society. iq scores are the measure of what you are able to do in society, not what you can do in your own life. i don't think it is stupid to have a high iq, but it's not stupid to not have a low iq. i'm not saying it's stupid, i'm just saying that it"

our knowledge of how atoms function, leading to developments in many fields, and enable our technology to take advantage of more mechanics of the universe than before. however, recently the amount of useful results to come out of the physics field seems to have dwindled. now, most of what is produced seems to deal with highly conceptual research, such as string theory and quantum gravity. other avenues of research, such as particle physics research, produce information with little to no practical uses for humanity. the large hadron collider alone cost 4. 75 billion, and annually requiring approximately 1 billion to continue operation. although the collider was instrumental in proving the existence of the higgs boson, the particle has no uses. other experiments involve not investigating anything new at all, merely proving and re proving what we already know about relativity and its related research. instead of continuing to pour money into a field which has extremely limited benefits, i believe funding should be taken out of the physics field and used to solve real problems in the world. the money used to build the lhc could have been used for things like feeding the poor, fixing the education system, or advancing medicine. if the lhc's annual budget was taken away, there would be an extra 1 billion dollars every year dedicated to solving tangible real world

quantum computer, which would drastically reduce latency between computer connections. physicists are working on breakthroughs in the field of solid state matter, which in the future will be applied to more efficient energy storage. others are working on breakthroughs in nuclear fusion. which will be applied to greener safer energy. the thing with physics is that the benefits aren't felt immediately. that's why people aren't as aware of the practical applications. physicists lay out the roadmap for engineers to develop a practical product. this has been true throughout all of history.

' 3. i'm not really sure what work 'regiment' is doing in your definition, but this is the part that seems to least relevant to fascism. economic interventionism, the left most certainly is. but that does not make them any more or any less fascist than the right. amp; x200b;",the problem with your definition of fascism is that you're conflating 'fascism' with 'fascist' and 'fascist.'the difference is that the two are very different things. one is a fascist. the other is a republican.,"i don't think it's fair to say that the left is more in favor of censorship than the right. if you look at the history of the us, you'll see that the vast majority of the time, the majority of times, the left was more in favour of censorship. in fact, it's more likely that the right is more likely to be against censorship.","the problem with your argument is that you are using the word 'fascism' as a synonym for 'fascist'. the term 'fascist' is used to refer to a group of people who do not have the same level of power as the majority of people. it's not just 'fascist', it's 'fascist.'the problem with the term is that it's used in a lot of different contexts. in the us, the word is used in different contexts to describe"

the world we live in has drastically changed with our new ideas. for this reason the cycling of human life is necessary. those who are old overwhelmingly tend to become stuck in their ways, believing that their longevity makes their points of view valid. curing a death will either put a halt to this change, or slow it dramatically due to the need to control our population. 3: having a cure for death would require us to impose extreme controls on our population. currently, our population is growing at an alarming rate, while the condition of our planet deteriorates. if we find a death cure, and continue to grow in the same way, we will very quickly outgrow our means for sustaining ourselves. the solution to this problem would be imposing extreme controls on who can breed and when. these things would need to be monitored, and rules would need to be enforced. i don't think i need to describe the dystopian future that this would create. the idea of even being able to successfully control the breeding of 7 billion people is extremely difficult. rather than keeping one organism alive for a potential eternity, it is far easier to have that organism breed, multiply, and have their offspring do the same. this allows for the spreading favorable traits, creating new and better version of each organism. 5: with an eternity to live, inevitably you will get bored. sooner or later in an infinite time span you will no longer be able to find joy in what mortal life might have to offer. when you've seen an done everything over an infinite amount of time, you'll eventually decide it's time to check out anyway. this isn't inherently bad, a desire to live is necessary for life to carry on. cmv currently my comments aren't coming through properly are being tacked on to the wrong posts. i will reply to comments as soon as i can."," Attaining biological immortality would not be good for the human species and, ultimately, is a selfish idea. : firstly, this post is inspired and essentially a response to the following two videos by youtuber cgp grey: typically, i love content from this channel, but i find myself vehemently disagreeing with the simplicity of his view about the function of death as a part of life. the following are reasons why i believe death needs to happen. the idea that suddenly everyone will be immune to death, and that the last person will die forever is preposterous. this would cause widespread issues including backlash from those whos religion does not agree with immortality, for example panic, and most likely a desperate struggle for people to gain access to this 'death cure'. the presence of a death cure itself would cause a great deal of chaos, and even if the chaos ends one day, there will be other issues that arise 2: having a world where old ideas, practices, beliefs, and ideologies remain with the people who hold them sounds awful. the way things are now, new people are being born every day bringing new points of view, movements, and ideas forward. with new generations comes innovation and change. think of some of the points of view or ideologies held by people as early as 20 years ago. now think about 50 years ago. 100 years?

 Not everyone should be allowed to have children,"the three main bases of assessment would be: 1 financial economic, 2 psychologically, 3 criminal history. 1. economically financially: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to provide for the child's basic needs housing, food, reasonable estimate of healthcare etc. , and education at least through high school . this would be based on a holistic assessment of the person's and or couple's current income both active and passive , earning potential, availability of fairly liquid capital; the total earning potential should be able to cover the benchmarked costs for the above mentioned necessities without incurring excess debt i haven't calculated exactly what that'd be, but it'd be leveraging themselves up to a certain percentage of their current income 2. psychologically: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they pass a psychological evaluation that deems them fit to be parenting. i haven't completed figured out what the guidelines would be yet, but it would basically have to demonstrate that the person or couple doesn't have any severe mental disorders nor a recurring history of disorders . 3. criminal history: the person or couple cannot have a lengthy or recurring history of criminal activities this would be based on a has a lengthy history of criminal offenses; not civil offenses their past would need to be evaluated and indexed based on severity; e. g. first degree murder would pretty much rule out your chances, while involuntary manslaughter would be need to be further examined . ultimately, i think successfully implementing these measures would: increase gdp per capita, increase household income per capita, increase household expenditure per capita, decrease income inequality, increase literacy rates, reduce violent crime, decrease household debt, reduce underemployment and unemployment note: unemployment is different from underemployment . these quantitative changes would also qualitatively lead to a 'better society' with a higher quality of living. this is still a developing view, but it's a rough idea that i've been thinking about recently. i did a lazy job of fully fleshing out my thoughts because there're just way too many changes and causal links to list, but feel free to pick something and question it. you won't be able to cmv if you talk about how this isn't feasible in terms of implementation."," Not everyone should be allowed to have children : the three main bases of assessment would be: 1 financial economic, 2 psychologically, 3 criminal history. 1. economically financially: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to provide for the child's basic needs housing, food, reasonable estimate of healthcare etc. , and education at least through high school . this would be based on a holistic assessment of the person's and or couple's current income both active and passive , earning potential, availability of fairly liquid capital;

suffered from gun violence. we can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. to build on the success of the lifesaving brady handgun violence prevention act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy; and keep weapons of war such as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines lcam's off our streets. we will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. there is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue. what part of this troubles you enough to vote for someone from a different party? note that in these modern times, the 4th amendment is much more important than the 2nd amendment in securing our freedom from tyranny. however, i appreciate that some people are in situations where they need guns to ensure their personal security.","i'm not going to try to change your view, but i'm going to point out that you seem to be a bit confused about what the second amendment is. i don't know what the first amendment is, but it seems to me that you're confusing it with the 'right to self defense' clause of the constitution. that's not to say that you don't have the right to defend yourself, but that it is not the same thing as the right of self defense.","i'm a democrat, and i don't think you should vote for a democrat. i'm not sure what you mean by democrats, but i think it's important to note that democrats are not the only ones who want to restrict gun rights. i think they are the ones who are trying to limit gun rights, and that's a good thing, but that doesn't mean that they are all the same. there are plenty of democrats who don't care about gun rights","i don't know what your view is, but i don't think it's fair to say that democrats want to restrict your rights to self defense. i think they're trying to restrict the rights of people who don't want to have guns. i'm not saying that they should be allowed to own guns, but that they shouldn't be able to own them. it's not like they want to ban them, it's just that they don't have the right to have them"

Most recreational drugs should be legalised.,"the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why? well when any society attempts to control the consumption of any substance by banning it, we get black markets. that is essentially all strict drug laws do, they create a black market. that black market fuels organised crime and demonises certain persons from society. my second reason, is that if you legalise certain drugs people are consuming anyway you remove the taboo of them seeking help if they become addicted. as it currently stands there is help for those who want to quit smoking tobacco or quit consuming alcohol. these drugs are arguably far worse than most other substances available on the black market. my last reason is i fully believe that a lot of people can take other substances responsibly, in the same way one consumes alcohol. not every user is an addict. i think we need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable. i welcome any counter arguments here, in which may change my view.","Most recreational drugs should be legalised. : the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why?

" Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance.","let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k. 's claims that he did not fully understand how much power he wielded over these individuals because of his celebrity. to his cr, in every one of these instances, c. k. did ask before committing these acts. these instances seemed to happen at the time when his career was first starting to really flourish. i take him for his word when he said he didn t understand how, in his newly found celebrity, asking wasn t really asking. that is in no way an excuse for what c. k. did because his behavior was still wildly inappropriate, but i am still somewhat sympathetic to his explanation, which leads into my third point 3 lack of predatory nature: louis c. k. made bad judgments, but his behavior does not seem predatory to me the same way cosby's, spacey's, and weinstein s were. he never threatened to ruin a woman's career for not allowing him to expose himself in front of them, and based on the information we currently have, it seems as if this behavior stopped at some point. now, it is alleged that c. k. s agent david becky may have made vague threats on louis' behalf to the women who accused him, but i don't think that is enough to put that blame on louis. it is possible becky was acting without c. k. s knowledge. furthermore, when the ny times article was published, i found louis c. k. 's response to be a no bs acknowledgement of both the accusations and the hurt he caused. i think we have to give c. k. crfor that. 5 a learning moment: undoubtedly, the importance of metoo is that it finally gives victims of sexual assault a voice. but perhaps also we should hear from truly contrite men who have behaved inappropriately in the past to understand their reasoning and learn from their thoughts and regrets. i don t believe we should give predatory monsters like cosby, spacey, and weinstein a voice to explain their actions. it may be too soon for c. k. to make a comeback , but i think some day he should be allowed to."," Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance. : let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k.

 Addiction is a choice not a disease,"at least initially. there is a time in everyone s life where they may be offered the opportunity to engage in excess drinking, smoking, etc. you choose to either take or not take the pill. you choose to either inject the needle or not inject that needle. you choose to drink that alcohol."," Addiction is a choice not a disease : at least initially. there is a time in everyone s life where they may be offered the opportunity to engage in excess drinking, smoking, etc. you choose to either take or not take the pill. you choose to either inject the needle or not inject that needle. you choose to drink that alcohol.","Taking drugs is not always a victimless crime, as drug users can harm others.","do you consider diseases to be only those things with tangible representations in the real world? meaning something which can be isolated and examined on some level, like a bacteria or a virus or a patch of cancerous skin cells or a particular brain formation even the absence of something like a depressed person missing their correct balance of neurotransmitters? because a great deal of mental disorders psychopathologies would not meet that criteria. there are many debilitating conditions which have no physical representation in reality. it would be nice if you could take someone with ocd, put them in an mri, and say, 'you see this bump right here? that's your ocd. ' unfortunately most conditions like this don't work that way. also . . . if someone is regularly taking a substance drugs for a long time, then goes off that substance, the nerve dendrites which normally recieve the neurotransmitters produced by taking the drug can actually start to grow seeking more of the drug. imagine the dendrites are like garage doors that drugs use to park their cars. if you deprive those garage doors of cars, they will start making more garage doors in the hopes of enticing more cars to park in them. it's a literal ramping up of the craving for more drugs that someone who has not been taking a lot of drugs wont feel. and when the next time there's a big flood of cars, well look at all these nice new garages to house them all.","i don't think it's fair to say that everyone should be able to choose to take the pill, but it's also unfair to assume that everyone has the right to choose whether to take it or not. for example, if someone wants to drink alcohol, they can choose to not drink alcohol at all. if they want to take a pill, they could choose not to drink at all, but they can also choose to smoke at the same time. it's not fair to assume","i think you're missing the point. addiction is a choice. it's not a disease, it's a choice, and that's what it is. you can choose to take a pill or not take the pill, but that doesn't mean that you can't choose to be addicted to it. it just means that you have to choose between taking the pill and not taking it.","i agree with you that taking drugs is a victimless crime, but i disagree that it's a 'victimless crime.'for example, if you are in a car accident, you are going to have to deal with the consequences of your actions. if you have a gun, you can use it against someone else. if someone has a gun to your head, you cannot use it to kill them. you can't force someone to kill you, but you can force someone"

 I believe nudity should not be illegal,"so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic."," I believe nudity should not be illegal : so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic.",I believe that public nudity should be completely legal.,"honestly my first thought, what if ladies leave snail trails on park benches and weird dudes with boners get their pre on stuff that we'll all touch? it's a fucked up idea but cmon i'm thinking if you let people be naked in a place like nyc, there would be way too much weird fucking shit going on man.","i don't see how it's going to change your view. if you don't want to be a part of public nudity, then you should not be allowed to be in public.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i'm going to try to change your view. first off, i don't think you should be forced to be nude in public. if you're in a public place, and you're exposed to a bunch of germs, then you're not going to be able to get away with it. secondly, i think you're forgetting that public nudity is not a protected right. it's a protected class. you can't","i don't see how this is going to change your view. if you want to ban nudity in public, you should be able to do so in public. if it is legal, then it should be legal. but if it isn't legal, why should it be legal?"

" Defining sexuality as ""attraction to sex"" is an unhelpful way for people to label themselves: it should instead be ""attraction to gender"".","small background: argued this point in another post, but the discussion was pretty cancerous and got nowhere, so i won't bother linking it; but feel free to look it up in my post history if interested the big comments, basically . i am very interested in legitimate counter arguments, so i posted this here. words have definitions, and are used to describe the world in useful ways. definitions cannot be proven wrong because they are axiomatic: they change overtime when a new definition for word x is better , not when the old definition is 'wrong'. this is not a good argument, as i see it. it's the rhetorical equivalent of 'it's wrong because it's not right', when the debate isn't about right or wrong, but more vs less useful, and definitions are never estabilished fact they change along time, locale, context, even between dictionaries . also: reminder that gender is, in pragmatic terms, gender identity expression, independent from sex. and for those unaware, 'trans woman' means male to female transgender, vice versa for trans men. just to avoid potential confusion. onto the real point: why is my definition more useful?

 Public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a major part of the base curriculum.,"if you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . also, i m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. i m not talking about teaching kids a few basic social skills. productivity, stability, cooperation, families and relationships are all greatly dependent on having a healthy understanding of one's own emotions and an understanding of how emotions work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on subjects of mental health and happiness because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. this is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. and teaching the foundations of that science to students as they live with emotional responses as a constant and resonating force in their own minds and as they interact with others in any all situation s could very likely improve

random subjects taught in base curriculums. interchange them with other core classes if you disagree with those choices it's not really relevant to the opinion itself. psychiatry is only one small aspect of mental health."," Public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a major part of the base curriculum. : if you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . also, i m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. i m not talking about teaching kids a few basic social skills. productivity, stability, cooperation, families and relationships are all greatly dependent on having a healthy understanding of one's own emotions and an understanding of how emotions work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on subjects of mental health and happiness because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. this is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. and teaching the foundations of that science to students as they live with emotional responses as a constant and resonating force in their own minds and as they interact with others in any all situation s could very likely improve productivity and senses of fulfillment and belonging for millions of people and generations to come. i should also note that saying 'math and english' was not

responsibility of the parents. schools are good for teaching standardized information to lots of kids at once. the mental health aspects i think are more person specific. people respond to different stimuli differently, have different chemical imbalances, have different dispositions towards depression anxiety, etc. i don't think a standardized approach that would be found in a school is going to work very well. also, psychology and ap psychology are taught in a lot of high schools already.","i don't think it's fair to assume that mental health is a mental health issue. i think it is a medical issue, but it is not a mental illness.","i think you are missing the point of the science of emotion. it is a mental health issue. it's not something that should be taught in schools, it's something that needs to be taught at home. if you want to teach it in public schools, you need to be teaching it at home, not in the classroom.","i think it would be a good idea to teach mental health as a core subject in public school, but i don't think it's the right way to go about it. i think that mental health should be taught as a primary subject, but that's not the same as teaching it as a secondary subject."
 It's completely acceptable and understandable to not agree with homosexuality because of your religion.,i often find on the internet and in real life that people believe any person to disagree with being gay due to their religious beliefs is ignorant or a homophobe. it's so often in the media that some religious person such as the owner of chick fil a will come under fire for being a homophobe yet even he was simply telling his beliefs. it says many times in the bible that a man shall not lay with another man. for someone to read these words and to take them to heart makes them a bigot? if someone is religious but they also hate gay people then they are homophobic. however if someone disagrees with homosexuality but treats anyone as their neighbor and loves them regardless as the bible and quran and torah say then they are just people who hold a belief. if it's a sin to be gay then it's possible not to be gay. i'd also like to say that this is not my beliefs at all i'm an atheist but i have a lot of experience with religion in my family., It's completely acceptable and understandable to not agree with homosexuality because of your religion. : i often find on the internet and in real life that people believe any person to disagree with being gay due to their religious beliefs is ignorant or a homophobe. it's so often in the media that some religious person such as the owner of chick fil a will come under fire for being a homophobe yet even he was simply telling his beliefs. it says many times in the bible that a man shall not lay with another man. for someone to read these words and to take them to heart makes them a bigot? if someone is religious but they also hate gay people then they are homophobic. however if someone disagrees with homosexuality but treats anyone as their neighbor and loves them regardless as the bible and quran and torah say then they are just people who hold a belief. if it's a sin to be gay then it's possible not to be gay. i'd also like to say that this is not my beliefs at all i'm an atheist but i have a lot of experience with religion in my family.,i don't think being religious makes you a homophobe,i find your view too vague for a response. what does disagree with homosexuality entail? does it include using your religious beliefs as a rationale to treat gays differently? or is it just limited to not officiating at a gay wedding?,"i don't think it's really a matter of whether or not someone is a bigot or not. i don't know if it's a question of whether a person is homophobic or not, but i think that's a very important distinction. if a person believes that it's ok to be gay, then they're not homophobic. if they believe that homosexuality is a sin, then it's not a homophobe.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'completely acceptable and understandable' here, but i would like to point out that it's not entirely acceptable to not agree with homosexuality because of your religion. for example, if you believe that it is a sin to be gay, you are a bigot. if you don't believe that being gay is a choice, then you are not a bigot either.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'homophobe', but i think you're missing the point. if you're talking about someone who believes that homosexuality is a sin, then you're not a homophobe."

1. 2. provides freedom to both people and rewards high earners in exchange for providing more this allows both parties to win. 3. this makes their life much more difficult and makes them less capable of affording more. 4. gifts are more meaningful in a fully shared money situation, gifts are important but also become difficult to justify. makes for a difficult situation. 5. use your own money. no problem! want to buy a ps4? no need to ask me, go for it! want to go out and treat 10 people out to drinks? go for it! not my money, not my problem. again this is basically the freedom argument. caveats i know there are exceptions to this rule. i'll try to list out as many as i can. and yes some of this repeats from the beginning of the post but i thought mentioning it twice makes it more likely for everyone to see it. here's a real life example. i make 80k and my girlfriend makes 30k post taxes. but neither of us works harder than the other. she makes 30k because she chose a career that's important for the world, but pays very very little. if we do a 75 75 split, then i end up keeping 20k per year. she gets 7. 5k. maximum retirement contribution is 5. 5k. so now i have 14. 5k left and she only has 2k. 2k for a whole year is nothing. she can barely afford anything for herself. i keep 20k, she gets 15k. now it's more even, now it's fairer. cmv"," A joint account with a percentage-of-income (with a few other considerations) is the best way to split money : i know this can have a lot of exceptions. please don't make your arguments about pointing out 2 or 3 exceptions that are technically true. i'll list a few to save the trouble: a person with reckless spending or addiction gambling issues should not have this split. significant inheritances should not necessarily have this split the extremely rich or extremely poor should not necessarily have this split massive debts massive differences in work time lots of other exceptions but for most people, i think this split is the best method. money has an economic value. if you compare the salary of a strategic consulting manager and a veterinarian assistant, you're going to get 200k versus 40k or something crazy. but in a relationship, i don't think economic value should necessarily be considered, unless the difference in income is so vast that one person's income is literally chump change i. e. 500k vs 30k . in a relationship, especially that of a marriage, the 'most important value' is time and effort of the individual. person1 makes 80k after taxes; person2 makes 40k. person1 would input 40k into their joint account, while person2 inputs 20k. as a result, in real money, person1 is providing more. person2 is also providing 50 . caveat. please read this caveat. let's say for example i make 100k and my partner makes 20k. i put in 50k and keep 50k while she puts in 10k and keeps 10k. unfortunately, that means that i get to live it up and have a pretty damn good life whereas she has to keep both savings and expenses under 800 per month. so why this view?

no need to ask me, go for it! want to go out and treat 10 people out to drinks? go for it! not my money, not my problem. again this is basically the freedom argument. caveats i know there are exceptions to this rule. i'll try to list out as many as i can. and yes some of this repeats from the beginning of the post but i thought mentioning it twice makes it more likely for everyone to see it. here's a real life example. i make 80k and my girlfriend makes 30k post taxes. but neither of us works harder than the other. she makes 30k because she chose a career that's important for the world, but pays very very little. if we do a 75 75 split, then i end up keeping 20k per year. she gets 7. 5k. maximum retirement contribution is 5. 5k. so now i have 14. 5k left and she only has 2k. 2k for a whole year is nothing. she can barely afford anything for herself. i keep 20k, she gets 15k. now it's more even, now it's fairer. cmv","i think the most sensible split of money in a relationship or any relationship is: ""you get what you deserve, she gets what she can afford.""","while i haven't personally dealt with large scale financing with a long term partner, i have been on many multi day dates or trips with friends that involved some amount of covering who paid for what, or people paying up front for rooms and getting paid back by the group later, or whatever. what i noticed was that there were two very distinct philosophies regarding payment. some people wanted extremely equitable payments, keeping track of most all expenses and the relative amount owed by most everybody. they would be very upset if they felt transactions were 'unfair', or if people failed to remember even minor exchanges who went on a donut run in the morning, or w e . another group of people, while obviously not willing to cover everything for people, would basically just take things as they went and expect all the little expenses to even out over time. if they noticed a trend e. g. they're paying for every donut run , they'd bring it up and ask somebody else to cover, but not try to figure out how much anybody 'owed'. to this group of people, not only did they not need to have everything turn out 100 equitably all the time, it was actually deeply unpleasant to deal with the sort of exact tallying and scorekeeping and reminders that were part of keeping things equitable. to use an analogy, it's the difference between the people who keep track of whose turn it is to buy a round at the bar, versus the people who figure that rounds at the bar will even out in the long term. relationships are no doubt the same way. some people might really want things to be equitable and to figure out exactly how much is appropriate to spend and who pays for what from the get go. if that's what works for you, more power to you. but plenty of people don't want that, and in fact find that sort of tallying to be a tremendous and unnecessary burden when a combination of trust not caring about exact quantities spent works out well enough.","i think you're conflating two different things. first, it's important to understand that money is a product of our society, and that we value it more than other things. for example, if i make 100k and you make 50k, then you're giving me 100k, and i'm giving you 100k. second, it is important to realize that money isn't just a product. it's also important to recognize that money can be used to buy things,",i don't think you have a good argument for why a couple should split their money. i don't see any reason why a single person shouldn't be able to split their own money.,"i think the main issue is that you are assuming that money has an economic value. if you believe that money does have a value, then you are correct. however, this is not always the case. for example, if you were to say that a person with reckless spending or addiction gambling issues should not have this split, you would be correct. but if you are saying that gambling is the most important thing in a relationship, then it would be a huge mistake to assume that gambling"

gives incentive to progress, weather its building shelters, eating food or getting money, the brain rewards good actions that help the body. but the world has changed since we truly had to hunt food. so many replaced that with there jobs. and money being the prey. the brain rewards you for progression at work, like a raise. because the brain loves to work on big projects that take a ton of time.

" Poe Dameron was not simply just wrong for questioning Admiral Holdo and taking action, nor was he the ""true villain"" of TLJ.","i think i maybe should've made this 'cmv: holdo should have done something to inspire all members of the resistance to trust in her and not come up with a plan of their own especially considering poe's history . ' poe obviously made some serious mistakes previously, but i believe that in regards to the chase and their plans, he and holdo were both right and wrong in some respects. i recently had a discussion with someone where they told me that they thought that he should have just trusted her and done as he was told, that all in the military should always follow their orders without question though i'm not trying to open another rabbit hole with that , and that the scene was meant to illustrate how men need to just shut up and listen to women. she may have had a plan and it may have worked and by that one could argue that she was right; i see this as a parallel to the jedi at large. i believe this ties in with luke's saying the jedi need to end and all of that to illustrate how even if one group may be in some way right, if they can't effectively communicate why they're right or something else to get people to trust in it enough to actually implement it, it's not going to succeed or produce the desired change or outcome regardless. like how much anakin was preached to about the evils of the dark side but was never communicated the realities of it well enough to successfully instill in him what it would take to get him to have not gone down that path. holdo failed as a leader by failing to instill the faith in her needed for her plan to work successfully. it's 100 fair for her to not have wanted to divulge specific details in an effort to safeguard the plan, but given what she thought of poe as a person i think it's completely fair to say that she definitely should have at least simply told him that she did have a plan and that she wasn't just going to let them all die without even trying to do anything, which is what she led them to believe was happening. she didn't even have a look of confidence when saying what she said to the crew, again that could have been intentional in an effort to keep the plan secret, but she should have said something more to, at least, poe. what good is a leader who knows exactly how to fix all our problems if they aren't actually a leader and can't get people to actually do the things to make those changes happen? poe was faced with a situation where he was basically told that they were just going to fly til they ran out of fuel and the enemies caught up and killed them, without even trying to do anything about it. he was given, so far as i perceived, no reason to support this order other than the fact that she was of superior rank. he made the call in his mind that since they were just going to let them all die that he would at least come up with a plan to try and do something about it, a plan which a black guy and an asian woman both also supported and helped to come up with but no one seems to talk about the black guy or asian woman who also didn't follow holdo and supported taking action on their own . this whole thing seems to be getting reduced to being about sex, or more specifically, the evils of white males and the patriarchy, and the fact that a black guy and asian woman also opposed holdo doesn't fit in with that notion very well. the other person also said how if he just would have followed his superior's order how the plan would have worked perfectly. one could, perhaps fairly, say that this wouldn't even be a factor or a point for me to make if he had followed orders, but i can also, i believe fairly, say that if finn and rose had followed orders and gotten the right person at the casino instead of deciding that they could make due with the option that presented itself as opposed to the one they were ordered to find that then poe's plan would have worked. really, both plans could have actually simultaneously worked. if finn and rose had gotten the right person and managed to covertly board the enemy ship and disable their shields, anyone not necessary for the fight could have escaped in the landing pods and just a few could have stayed back to try and destroy the enemy ship; in which case they would again already be facing death and if the battle started going south then they could have still simply flew lightspeed through it as holdo did on her own. i may be wrong but i think it's also fair to speculate that it would have taken fewer people in the ship for the battle than the number that died in the pods in the failed escape attempt. the last jedi, to me, was about how much more complicated these things are than any of us generally like to contend with. about the problems with the mindset of 'i'm right so you just need to shut up and do what i say because i'm right.

' they may damn well be right but that is certainly not an effective way to act because it will not inspire people to come to follow you. we must demand more of our leaders and we must be more sympathetic to and have more empathy for those we view as being in opposition to us, if not out of care for them out of care for actually advancing your own correctness instead of just ranting about how smart you are and how dumb everyone else is and how the world would be so much better if we just listened to you continuously because no matter how much you rant it doesn't cause the change you wish to see. yoda told luke that the best thing he may have to offer as a teaching are his mistakes, and from that he tells leia that no one is ever really gone. they can't give up on kylo, ben is still there. luke can't try to kill his nephew because of a dream he had and we can't declare people to be evil and delete them from our lives because they voted for trump. if we actually are so much smarter and want the world to be better then we need to be better and we need to do more and we need to care and work not just within the frame of how we feel things should be people should just follow orders and consider and work also based on how things actually are at the present moment consider your feeling that this person is wreckless and in your mind simply sexist and realize that they will probably not follow you if you don't do something more to get them to, regardless of whether that's something you should have to do or not . that is not, however, to say that we shouldn't also work to move things in the direction of how they should be. tldr some are acting like it's just an issue of sexism and i think that's an almost comically absurd i say almost because it's too troubling to really be funny for me, i thought the movie made such a beautiful statement that seeing it so severely oversimplified and misperceived damn near makes me sick oversimplification at best and to a degree just plain wrong.",poe and finn were both right in some respects,"i think your view can boil down to yes and no . as an enlisted service member, i can tell you that poe was 100 wrong. and if he had pulled that stunt in the armed forces, he would have been tossed in jail and court martialed. there are two levels in the battlefield; tactical and strategic. poe, as a fighter pilot directly albeit the best in the resistance is at the tactical level. his technical knowledge is incredibly strong, he can think on his feet, and he can be relied on to win any battle. admiral holdo is at the strategic level. she s not focused on the battles, though winning them is important; she s focused on the war. a consequence of that is what leads to a lot of lower ranking officers and enlisted personnel not thinking very highly of anyone with stars on their shoulders; generals and admirals are often not seen as being very in touch with their junior personnel. holdo has the entire resistance to think about, not just the ego of the hot shot fly boy who just cost them their entire bomber fleet. but this is where the resistance itself comes into play. the resistance is not a military. they have ranks, but not uniforms, and a very loose chain of command which can beat be described as tldr; leia s in charge. i would honestly classify them as more of a guerrilla unit than an army. without those reinforced chains of command, you open yourself up to a situation where a junior officer leading others into a mutiny could happen. you could argue that this is a good thing, but at the end of the day you have a situation where poe jeopardized the escape plan holdo put together because he didn t trust his leadership.","i don't think it's a good idea to try to change your view on the subject. i think the problem with your view is that it assumes that the jedi have a plan and that it's the right thing to do. that's not the case. the problem is that you assume that all jedi leaders have some sort of plan, and that they don't. if you think that's the case, then you're wrong.","i don't think it's possible to change your view without changing your view. i think you're right that the jedi need to end, but that's not the point of the plot. the plot is to show that they have a plan, and that they are willing to go through with it. it's not that they aren't willing to do it, it's that they don't want to risk losing their trust in their leader.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i think it's important to remember that the jedi are a very different species than any other. they are a group of people with very different values and beliefs, and that's why they need to be able to communicate their beliefs and beliefs with each other. in the end, there is no point in trying to convince everyone that they are right or wrong. it's a matter of trying to get everyone to believe in"

 Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing,"for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me? ' and you're reluctant to tell them the real reason, you're probably using them and you should probably break up with them. response 1: 'as long as it's between consenting adults, there's nothing wrong with it and we shouldn't judge them too harshly. ' consent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an action to be ethical. that is, for a relationship to be ethical, it must at a minimum be consensual, but it takes more than that. it must also be genuinely good in the long term for all parties involved. for instance, it wouldn't be ethical for two completely incompatible people to date each other just because they're both terrified of being alone, even if they both consent to it. they could even hurt others if they have children. response 2: 'as long as you're upfront about your motives, you're in the clear.

' and they buy them anyway, sure, that's better than lying to them about it. but isn't it even better not to sell placebo drugs at all? similarly, if someone's just a rebound for you, it's better if you tell them that upfront rather than make them think they're special, but isn't it better still not to use someone that way in the first place? besides, our motives are often obscure even to ourselves. we may not realize someone was a rebound until the relationship is over. if you're not really, truly excited about someone after a few dates, then what are you still doing with them? response 3: sex is no big deal. it's just our messed up society that puts such an unhealthy emphasis on it. our society probably does have an unhealthy attitude toward sex. but sex is a big deal, and it's not just another activity like skiing. otherwise, we can't explain why forced sex is a special kind of crime. here's what i mean. rape is a serious crime, one that can potentially cause serious psychological damage. likewise, it's a serious crime for an adult to have sex with a child. part of the reason is that they can't meaningfully consent to sex. but why is meaningful consent necessary in this case? young children can't meaningfully consent to getting their hair cut or being taken skiing, either, but that's no crime. rape and sex with children are evil because it's a particularly heinous type of violation, perhaps a violation of something that should be sacred. it's not just an activity that our society places too much emphasis on. sex is intimate in a way that can cause lasting psychological damage if forced upon someone. presumably this is because sex is so deeply rooted in our biology that we can't help but have certain psychological reactions to it. sex does something to you, and you can't necessarily help it no matter how enlightened you are. or even if you can completely separate sex from all the messy emotions, you can't know if your casual partner is capable of doing the same, because you don't know them well. if sex is special, perhaps even sacred, we're playing with fire if we act as if it's no big deal. we risk hurting ourselves and others psychologically, even if it's all perfectly consensual. addendum: there's some part of me that still feels like i'm being ridiculous and unrealistic about my approach to dating, but my conscience won't be clear unless i can see why. or if i'm not being ridiculous, then at least i'll feel more confident about refusing to date anyone for any reason who doesn't meet my possibly unrealistic standards. i can't seem to settle this on my own, so i would appreciate some outside perspective and wisdom."," Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing : for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me?

we wouldn't accept that from any other sort of treatment. if we didn't collect that information we would still have the same poor treatment of hiv that we did in the 80s and 90s, same goes for cancer, and just about any other illness you can name. finally it seems that aa believes it s program is a one size fits all program when we know that many ailments require different treatments for different people. this is especially true for ailments that affect people mentally which i think it s safe to say that addiction falls under that same umbrella. people deal with various addictions in different ways, why aa treats alcohol as a one size fits all approach i can t say, maybe i m wrong, but based on the text of their twelve steps and twelve promises that doesn t seem to be the case. instead they seem to say that the only reason people fail is because the fail to give themselves over fully to the program which seems to be very very odd.","Alcoholics Anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasn't tried to improve it's system since it's inception : i have a friend who has been attending aa meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a dui for the record i don't know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or 'choose' jailtime and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not aa works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program. below i've listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner. this means that i m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change. 1. we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable. 2. came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understoodhim. 4. made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. admitted to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character. 7. humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings. 8. made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. sought through prayer and mation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. 12. my current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30 s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases. here are some of my thoughts on the matter. first up, as many have pointed out, there's a whole lot of god involved throughout the 12 steps 6 direct references and 7 if you count 2 , i'm not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend. if a person does not believe in god they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety. if alcoholism is a disease then why does aa treat it simply as a matter of will power?

 Rap is lower quality music and is overrated.,"before i get into this, let me be clear what i'm not trying to say : all rap is bad. rap takes no talent. people shouldn't listen to rap at all. people who listen to rap are less intellegent. all the problems i list are exclusive to rap and not other genres of music. ok, now let's get into this : 1. rap uses less people to create, which does not always indicate, but usually indicates less effort overall . obviously, the more people working on something, the more hours that can be put into something. that doesn't mean one person can't create something good, but the likelihood of an individual creating something good is statically less than that of a group. 2. most rap songs use rhymes, which can alter what the creator wants the song to mean . the creator of a song might want to portray a message, express an emotion s , or cause the listener to critically think in some way. since many rap songs rely heavily on rhyming their lyrics, they have to alter the words of the songs in order to rhyme. while this can be entertaining, the meaning of the song is often lost, misunderstood or not taken seriously. 3. rap relies too heavily on vocals and not a variety of instruments . that's not to say that rap never uses anything else, but vocals are always at the forefront; everything but the vocals is just background noise, vocals are emphasized. this means that rap as a genre lacks variety within artists and between artists. it becomes more difficult to distinguish between rap songs, and they start to blend together. this begins to ruin the perception of what's good and what's bad. on top of that, if the vocals are bad, the whole song is bad vs. if one instrument were bad, the entire song is not necessarily ruined. 4. rap is easier to learn than other genres that use other instruments, and most anyone can do it if try tried. there's no hand eye coordination with vocals as with a guitar or piano. on top of that, traditional vocals require the singer to use certain pitches consistently and at loud capacities and to a beat. this makes it easier to learn than other interments or vocals. meaning, people without natural talent can start rapping, and lesser quality songs can be made in abundance. of course, a rapper can spend an equal or greater amount of time practicing as any other musician. but remember, people can also get really good at sitting down and standing up, that doesn't equate to quality. i try to be objective, but i obviously wouldn't be making this argument if i didn't have a bias. i do enjoy some rap, i'm not completely adverse to it. other genres have similar problems, i would say the same of a lot of pop or country music. let me know what you guys think, am i way off base?

 The method of punishment should change,"'whatever undeserved evil you inflict upon another within the people, you inflict upon yourself' kant murderers should be murdered, exactly how they committed the murder. killed someone by throwing rocks at them?

 Race is a biological reality and IQ is partly genetic.,"hello, i m a white nationalist. i d like to change my view, i find myself seeing people as statistics and iq numbers instead of other humans. used to be a libertarian before i start, i don t believe in the superiority of any race over another, nor do i believe every white is smarter than every black or that every asian is smarter than every white. what i ll be discussing is averages. averages that explain a lot of inequality there are plenty of stupid asians smart blacks or average whites. everyone has the potential and is an individual. socioeconomic and cultural factors are the other very important half of this argument. i ll cite a few different sources and give a brief description jared taylor in the video he cites several different sources showing global iq tests, brain size variation between human subspecies specifically comparing east asians and african kenyans with a cranial capacity difference of almost a cup as well as studies that show brain size correlates highly with intelligence. these studies has been done countless times in different parts of the world and some were completely culturally neutral they didn t use a language and instead use shapes asians have an average iq of 105 110, whites 100 105, arabs 90 100, latinos 80 95, american blacks 80 90 and finally african blacks with a score of 75 on average. the bell curve cavalli sforza cluster tree. png here you can see a genetic map done with tests showing the different mapping s of the genetics of the different human subspecies. more studies have been done like this showing the distant genetics of different races. crime statistics it has been shown that low iq highly increases the likelihood that someone will commit crime. especially

white. what i ll be discussing is averages. averages that explain a lot of inequality there are plenty of stupid asians smart blacks or average whites. everyone has the potential and is an individual. socioeconomic and cultural factors are the other very important half of this argument. i ll cite a few different sources and give a brief description jared taylor in the video he cites several different sources showing global iq tests, brain size variation between human subspecies specifically comparing east asians and african kenyans with a cranial capacity difference of almost a cup as

didn t use a language and instead use shapes asians have an average iq of 105 110, whites 100 105, arabs 90 100, latinos 80 95, american blacks 80 90 and finally african blacks with a score of 75 on average. the bell curve cavalli sforza cluster tree. png here you can see a genetic map done with tests showing the different mapping s of the genetics of the different human subspecies. more studies have been done like this showing the distant genetics of different races. crime statistics it has been shown that low iq highly increases the likelihood that someone will commit crime. especially

that racial differences are averages and not inherent 100 of the time, then why not instead advocate for homelands based on those traits directly? for example, instead of a white homeland, why not a homeland for individuals of every race who have over 110 iq? why use race as a proxy for this?","i don't think you can argue that there is a biological difference between asians and asians, but i do

we should let people get comfortable with more gender conforming trans people that fit into cis society without requiring many changes, before we unleash the ey em genderfluid pansexual anarchocommunist demigirls i make fun of you 'cause i love you! . a few examples of strategies i'd like to see in the movement: redefine gender as something along the lines of 'if your birth certificate and sex hormones agree on one of 'male' or 'female', that is your gender. if not, you may self identify as either gender, and use the faculties of either gender, but may not participate in women's sports. ' this is, as the trump administration would say, 'grounded in science', while also being trans inclusive, and making at least some sense. it cedes some ground to the conservatives, while not really negatively affecting very many people's lives. i think it's a bad final definition for a variety of reasons, but i think it makes a decent starting point that is resistant to the conservative bogeyman of the weird creepy man that starts wearing a dress one day so he can use the women's room. i think that conservatives are imagining trans women as 'men in dresses' and trans men as 'women with buzzcuts'. so maybe we should make the image of trans people less 'weird androgynous in between folks' and more 'people who are basically the same as everyone else but changed their gender'. this is an example of something i'd like to see more of. we really have to stop minimizing people's concerns with the really thorny parts of the trans movement, like women's prisons, or women's sports. i think there are reasonable objections that we should take into account and think about , not just assume everyone raising them is a transphobic asshole. i am sure there are really good potential compromises on this stuff, but if we create a moratorium on anything that even kind of looks like transphobia from a distance, we're really hamstringing ourselves and there's no way we'll be able to find an effective solution that people are okay with.","i think it's important to recognize that the movement is not a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights. it's a movement that seeks to change the way people think about themselves, and that's a good thing.","i don't think it is a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights as it asks the rest of the population to change their behaviour, and tells them that not only the things they say but the way they act is likely to end up in the 'bigot' category.","i think it's important to note that you're talking about a very small group of people. there are a lot of people who are transgender, but i don't think that's necessarily the case. i think the issue is that there are so many people who don't identify as their gender, and it's not like they aren't going to be able to do so, because they don't know what they're going to do with their body. i'm not saying that it's"

the first months of the bush presidency were taken up with the popping of the tech bubble. in retrospect it wasn't that big of a deal and certainly got over shadowed by other events, but at the time it was a big deal and demanded a huge amount of time dealing with the economic and social impacts. which means i don't think any reasonable president acting without advanced knowledge could have avoided 9 11. would you agree with me on that? now if you accept that 9 11 has happened, i am also going to propose to you that the invasion of afghanistan was also unavoidable. even if you had perfect knowledge of what would happen there, any president would have be compelled to invade afghanistan. lets then talk about iraq. post 9 11 the usa quickly realized that the status quo in the middle east was not acceptable to it. people chanting 'death to america' in the streets was going to eventually lead to attacks. philosophically it became clear that america couldn't simply wall itself off from the rest of the world but instead needed to get involved more directly. so we had a list of hot spots. russia, iran, iraq, north korea, saudi arabia, and 'palestine' that were the major issues. bush put a lot of diplomatic effort into russia and thought he had developed a good working relationship with putin. he read putin wrong. but someone had to. someone had to give putin the chance to play the good guy and let him make the active choice to instead play the bad guy. bush took the hit on that. but look at hrc at state and the reset button. they tried again, and failed again, so it isn't as though bush's actions here were unreasonable. if anything bush was ahead of the curve figuring out who putin was. north korea bush engaged in some pretty successful diplomacy and definately got the pot down to a simmer there. it was obama who allowed the heat to be reapplied. on the saudi arabia front the kingdom basically got on a path towards reform and has been making little steps along it ever since and while its still a shit show and a lot of crgoes to obama for continuing the good work and building on it , its better than iran or iraq so that's some kind of win right? so bush was left with iraq and iran. historic enemies of each other, both enemies of america, and both actively funding terrorists and interesting in wmd's. iraq however was giving good cause for war. they were violating the terms of the first gulf war's end by frustrating the work of weapon's inspectors this was a deliberate policy of saddam so that other players in the region would think he had wmd's available to him . they were firing on us warplanes patroling the no fly zone on a regular basis this is independently a near weekly act of war against the united states . they were funding terrorism in israel and around the world openly paying the families of dead terrorists for successful attacks . and so they were invaded. the decision was put to congress, and virtually every democratic senator and congressman voted in favor of it. would clinton have done otherwise had he been in office? i doubt it. it was, to a certain extent, a war of choice. however post 9 11 saddam's course of conduct was no longer acceptable to america. clinton might have tried deeper negotiations or pushed for more sanctions, but that would have sent a weaker message to iran. furthermore there was good reason to think, at the time, iraq was going to be a relative cake walk. or at least much less of a mess than it turned into. so i don't know if you can really say that clinton wouldn't have done exactly what bush did there. the one thought i will leave you with. the sanctions applied on iraq didn't personally hurt saddam. he had his lifestyle and if ten thousand children a month had to starve to death so that he could throw a lavish party using the food that would have saved them he threw the party. hundreds of thousands of people were dying in iraq yearly due to the sanctions we imposed. imagine we were 15 years later and the sanctions were still in place. who's the mass murderer now?",i'm not sure what you mean by bush jr.,"i don't know if you've read the whole post, but i think you're missing the point. the president of the united states is not a criminal. he is a war criminal, and he has done nothing to stop the war. he has been in office for more than a decade, and that's not a bad thing.","i don't think you should change the law in the uk to make it easier to travel. if you want to travel, you should be able to travel in the united states."

 Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication.,"my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable."," Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication. : my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable.",I believe that psychiatrists should not be allowed to diagnose children with mental illness.,"i think this decision should be left to doctors who study thousands of patients for years to determine what works and what doesn t. it should be left to their skilled opinions, not a layman s debate. doctor s wouldn t prescribe medicines that hurt unless the benefits outweighed the consequences.","as someone who has been on adhd for a few years, i can tell you that it's not a problem. it's a mental disorder. that's why it's called adhd. adhd is a disorder that's caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. there's a lot of research on it, but it's really not that big of a deal. the problem is that adhd has been around for a long time, and it's very difficult for people to",i don't think it's a good idea to put children on psychotropic medication because they don't yet have the maturity to be mature enough to be able to be fully responsible for their own actions. i don't see how it's wrong to put a child on a psychiatric medication if they aren't mature enough.,"i'm not sure i understand what you're trying to say, but i think it's important to note that adhd is not a mental illness, it's a neurological disorder. adhd isn't a mental disorder, it is a cognitive disorder. it is not something that can be treated by a psychiatrist. it isn't something that is a disease, it can be something that needs treatment. there is no such thing as a'mental illness', it's something that cannot be treated"

 I see no reason to get the flu shot,"first i am in good health and have a strong immune system. it has been years since i've suffered any notable illness. i am strongly in favor of most vaccines. one of my uncles died at a young age due to my grandparents on one side of the family being part of a well known deadly cult which shuns modern medicine. i have every standard vaccine given to someone born in the 1980s. the cdc states that the flu vaccine only reduces risk of influenza by 40 60 with notable reduction in effectiveness for certain types of flu. i have little to no contact with young children, the elderly, or those i know to have compromised immune systems. it is my belief that i should not pay money for the inconvenience of feeling unwell and being sore for a few days for a mildly reduced chance of an already unlikely event. it would likely make work miserable for me during that time and i am not willing to sacrifice my precious time off just to feel sick on purpose. i feel that the negatives severely outweigh the positives in this case. do you have any arguments to change my view?"," I see no reason to get the flu shot : first i am in good health and have a strong immune system. it has been years since i've suffered any notable illness. i am strongly in favor of most vaccines. one of my uncles died at a young age due to my grandparents on one side of the family being part of a well known deadly cult which shuns modern medicine. i have every standard vaccine given to someone born in the 1980s. the cdc states that the flu vaccine only reduces risk of influenza by 40 60 with notable reduction in effectiveness for certain types of flu. i have little to no contact with young children, the elderly, or those i know to have compromised immune systems. it is my belief that i should not pay money for the inconvenience of feeling unwell and being sore for a few days for a mildly reduced chance of an already unlikely event. it would likely make work miserable for me during that time and i am not willing to sacrifice my precious time off just to feel sick on purpose. i feel that the negatives severely outweigh the positives in this case. do you have any arguments to change my view?",i don't want to get the flu vaccine.,"please tell me if this makes no sense. i don't enjoy getting sick, and i do care enough about other people to not want to get them sick, however:i am neither young nor elderly mid 30's , and haven't had the flu in several years. i feel lucky for that, not naturally immune. i have convinced myself that it's okay, and possibly beneficial to get sick from time to time, because the body produces tumor necrosis factor when mounting an immune response. correct my logic if i'm way off, but maybe it's worthwhile if i get ill every so often if it means tumors are less apt to develop? and much as i enjoy life, i think it's okay if a bunch of humans die of natural causes. the world might be a better place for those who survive. amp; x200b;","i think it depends on what you mean by 'good health.'if you mean 'bad health' then i don't see how you can argue against that. i mean, if you're talking about people who don't have a strong immune system then you're probably right. but if you are talking about a person who doesn't have strong immune systems, then i think you're going to have a hard time convincing them that vaccines are good for them.","i don't think it's a good reason to get the flu shot, but i think it is a good idea to get it if you don't want to get sick.","if you don't want to get the flu, don't get it. it's not something you want to do."
 I think the Internet could eventually replace universities,"universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university? can disciplinary knowledge also become social knowledge that is freely accessed, produced and disseminated by literally anyone that might choose to participate? for this to be possible, i think we would need to see a couple big changes take place. first and foremost, we would need a sort of second wave enlightenment which would throw out the current paradigm of alternative facts and insulated echo chambers of information. society as a whole would need to accept a common sense of objectivity and rationality, such that it is able to uphold its own standards of legitimacy. bad faith research and education would need to be quickly marginalized; but we would also need to be willing to accept innovation and new ideas, as long as they meet the standards of our collective scrutiny. secondly, we would need to see some sort of system of compensation that would fund research and education as goods in themselves . as it currently stands, this is the biggest issue in higher education and research. during his presidency, reagan criticized the disciplinary knowledge produced by university researchers, claiming that they were merely satisfying personal curiosity about obscure or useless issues, and using this criticism to justify a massive defunding of higher education. the legacy of this defunding has been the increase in student tuition and debt, an increased presence of private businesses on university campuses, a new focus on collegiate athletics and recreation to attract students, the co opting of research by private interests, etc. research and education have been re cast as means to capitalist ends; research to provide technological innovations to industry, education to equip laborers with knowledge and or general capabilities needed for workplace success. for the internet to become the new medium for research and education, we would need to somehow return to a social paradigm where knowledge itself is a valid end to pursue, and education is inherently enriching , and these goods are willingly funded by society without some expectation of an economic return. can we reach this point in our future? i would speculate that we can for a couple reasons. there will come a tipping point where the continuous expansion of higher education devalues the degree such that it is no longer economically feasible to pursue. secondly, while much of what we see happening on the internet is not encouraging, there are still some bright spots, and there is still the fact that the internet is very young. we have future generations that will grow up not even knowing a time before the internet existed; we can hope that these new immersed generations will make better use of the internet as a medium for research and education. we can hope that these younger generations will react against the uncertainty and relativism of our current generations, and bring about this second wave enlightenment that would need to take place. change my view."," I think the Internet could eventually replace universities : universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university?

we fighting, and exactly what our goal is. mohammad mossadegh, president of iran during the early 50s, wished to nationalize the oil industry within iran. the company that is now known as british petroleum cried to the us and british governments of profits being impeded so the two governments teamed up to depose mohammad from power and install a puppet president, the shah, who would bow to the wills of the western world. the iranian people did not like that so in the late 70s, the citizens got together overthrowing the shah, taking over the us embassy there, and holding 66 americans hostage there over a year 444 days to be exact . thankfully, diplomacy ended the hostage situation amicably, but there is still a lot of anti american sentiment lingering in iran and they aren't wrong for holding it. 1990: saddam heussien, who were were allies with starting from the iran iraq war and ending in the above date, invaded kuwait. in response, president bush senior stationed troops on the border of saudi arabia and iraq on the saudi side which ticked off another one of our then current allies in the region, osama bin laden, the very same bin laden that led al qaeda until his death. a war on foreign soil can really only be won when you are not creating more enemies within its borders. among the reasons the vietnam war had to be declared a loss was because the viet cong was able to more easily recruit and replace its combatants that had been killed or captured. the growing disdain of the way at home didn't help any as well. by embracing the very same tactics they use against us, we are not proving ourselves to be the better man. rather we proving how shallow, careless, and greedy we are. if i were a citizen of the several countries the us is bombing, or one of its allies were bombing, i don't want the approaching squadron of helicopters to be what ends me, i want to be what ends them. you cannot expect to win a war by targeting civilians, you only give the civilians you didn't hit reason to take up arms against you. as much as it hurts to say this, the government of the united states deserved what happened on september 11th, and unless there is a major shift in foreign policy, preferably to one of non intervention, we are on a collision course for another terrorist attack of a similar scale. they don't hate us because of the freedoms afforded to us, they despise us because of what our government is doing to them. aside from south korea, i can't think of any country that has been made better off because the armed forces got involved in a conflict where they should've just stayed at home. tl:dr, when you embrace terrorist tactics, don't be surprised with disgruntled citizens employ the same tactics against you. sure, bombing isis territory with reckless abandon may end the threat that is isis for the time being, but what's stopping a civilian group from organizing a group that, in principle, is the exact same thing?","i agree with you, but i disagree with the idea that a tactical nuclear strike against a city is the only way to end the suffering of civilians. there are many cities in syria that are very important to the country, and there are also many cities that are important to muslims that are not important to isis. i would argue that a nuclear strike on a city would be a much more efficient way to kill civilians than a tactical nuke strike against the city itself.","i think it depends on what you mean by'moral high ground'. if we're talking about a war where there's a large number of civilians in the area, then we should be looking at a war in which there is a large amount of civilian casualties. if we are talking about an attack on a city, then i think that's a moral high ground. there are a lot of people who would be willing to die for the sake of the city, and it would be morally","i don't think there is a moral high ground when we shell cities and cause immense human suffering simply because we lack the'morality' to end their lives quickly. there are a number of reasons why a tactical nuclear strike would be more ethically considerable than a city siege:1. it would most likely kill all the civilians within the vicinity instantly. 2. the civilians in these cities will die a slow, painful and debilitating death because we carry out yearly sieges on cities"

criminal be more likely to rob, the neighborhood that has strict gun laws preventing owners in that community from owning firearms or the one that doesn't? not to say dogs aren't a good home defense

but you are not free to defend","i'm going to assume that you're not familiar with the second amendment. it was written as a way to protect yourself from violent criminals. it's not the same thing as using a gun to defend yourself from a violent criminal. it is the same way that a gun is used to defend you from a burglar. if you have a gun, you have the right to use it to defend your home, even if

" The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part","the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation? answer: they know people will pay to see it. 3. i think all the changes they have typically made between the original and the modern remakes have been 100 for the worse from my standpoint but 100 for the safer from a marketing standpoint. e. g. instead of the beast from beauty and the beast being a beast , he s like a tall muscly guy with a hairy face. in the cartoon he was an actual monster, not unlike a bearwolf hybrid. but this was more palatable in the 3d animation medium to marketers."," The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part : the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation?

 People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion.,"i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to? i feel like my life would be over if i was forced harshly to be a mother. also, i understand some of you will say that the child could be put up for adoption. however, i still believe that the woman shouldn t have to go through with the pregnancy, it should be her choice. even if somebody else can t conceive a child doesn t mean somebody else should. having a few less children in the world will be good. i understand that you may be pro life, which is fine. but i just think that they shouldn t project their views onto other women as we all deserve to make the choice for ourselves. it has been brought to my attention that things are different in the us than in the uk."," People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion. : i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to? i feel like my life would be over if i was forced harshly to be a mother. also, i understand some of you will say that the child could be put up for adoption. however, i still believe that the woman shouldn t have to go through with the pregnancy, it should be her choice. even if somebody else can t conceive a child doesn t mean somebody else should. having a few less children in the world will be good. i understand that you may be pro life, which is fine. but i just think that they shouldn t project their views onto other women as we all deserve to make the choice for ourselves. it has been brought to my attention that things are different in the us than in the uk.",i believe that women should be able to choose whether they want a child or not.,"to be honest, if someone wants to take an abortion, they should probably just do it because it's best for them, society and the baby if they just had the abortion because they clearly weren't prepared to have a child yet. but i feel that we should actually shame women for it because of the economical implications of abortion! there have been more than 58 million abortions, most of it would be due to not being able to raise the child, not wanting the child or accidental pregnancy while the rest would be to not want to bring an ill child to this world or something to that effect. now, abortions can cost from 0 975 so i read, could be more so we have spent billions at most and millions most probably on abortions that wouldn't have happened if these people took contraceptive pills, we need to shame them so that they more likely take steps like taking contraceptive pills because that money wasted could've gone to somewhere else more productive!","i'm not sure if this is a good or bad argument, but i'd like to ask you to clarify what you mean by'should' and'should'. are you saying that women are entitled to their own opinion?",i'm not sure what you mean by 'people should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion.

take germany. germany didn t even exist until 1871, and it was not at all obvious in advance how it would come together. what really united the prussians of koenigsburg with the swabians of w rttemberg? is schleswig german or danish? is alsace german or french? should the ethno state unite under prussian or austrian domination? what about the german speakers in suedtirol and sudetenland? or the volga germans? before ethnic nationalism, those questions weren t particularly important. with ethnic nationalism, it took multiple catastrophic wars to settle them. you mention foreigners going back to their homeland. but in many cases people were in their homelands, only for their homeland to become someone else s ethnostate. if the german ethnostate was going to use these ancient homelands to lay claim to territory von der maas bis an die memel and von der etsch bis an den belt, then the obvious solution was to expel everyone from those homelands. by the logic of the ethnostate, ethnic cleansing makes sense. the same story repeats itself for every ethnostate. france looks unified today, because they spent the last 200 years suppressing anyone who didn t fit the mold of french. the spanish attempt at an ethnostate inspired a violent ethnic revolt yugoslavia united itself under the banner of the southern slavs, until they remembered that croatians, serbians and bosniaks are completely different, even if their families had lived next door for hundreds of years. ethnostates look great if you re in the dominant group, but there really isn t any way to make one without a trail of atrocity and abuse along the way.","i'm going to try to change your view a little bit. i'm not sure if this is a good thing or not, but i think it's important to note that germany is not a european country. it's a country that was founded on the idea that europe was a melting pot. the idea of europe being a multicultural country is a bit of a stretch, but it's certainly not a bad idea.","i don't think it is okay to be a member of an ethno state. i think the problem is that there is a huge amount of overlap between ethno states and non ethno countries. for example, in europe, there are plenty of ethno nations that have a strong cultural identity. in the united states, there's a huge overlap between european and american cultures, and it's not uncommon to see a large overlap between the two cultures. europe","i don't see anything wrong with multiculturalism, because i don't think it's a bad thing. i think multiculturalism is a good thing, but i think it is a bad idea because it leads to a lot of bad things. i agree with you that it's good, but it's not a good idea for everyone. if you want to have a multicultural society, you have to be open to different cultures, and i think that's a good way to do that."

 Cast iron cookware fucking sucks.,"it is simply so heavy and unsanitary to me. so much stuff sticks to them and they seem so so dirty to me. if you scrub them, they are literally impossible to get clean if you run your finger across it, it s pretty much guaranteed to have stuff on it , and they are so high maintenance and rust prone. you have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off. it s disgusting, heavy, and high maintenance, with no super amazing benefits. change my view."," Cast iron cookware fucking sucks. : it is simply so heavy and unsanitary to me. so much stuff sticks to them and they seem so so dirty to me. if you scrub them, they are literally impossible to get clean if you run your finger across it, it s pretty much guaranteed to have stuff on it , and they are so high maintenance and rust prone. you have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off. it s disgusting, heavy, and high maintenance, with no super amazing benefits. change my view.",I think cigarette butts are disgusting.,"first, cast iron is far superior to others for many reasons, but to me mainly because of the very high heat retention, which is a product of the heaviness. this gives you much more uniform cooking all the way around. have you ever boiled water in a cheap pan on an electric coil stove and noticed you can see the bubbles in the ring pattern of the coils? your food will cook this unevenly too, but not so with a good cast iron because it distributes the heat better. this heat retention also helps with cooking meat. want to brown a roast? you need high sustained heat for that. the problem with other pans is that as soon as the roast touches the pan, the roast cools the pan down to too low a temperature to brown it well, while the stove struggles to keep the temperature up. but with cast iron, get that sucker smoking hot and go for it. the same applies to steaks. steaks made on aluminum suck, but they can be great on cast iron. it also helps for frying because the heat retention helps keep the oil at a constant temperature. you dunk your fries in, the oil tries to cool down, the pan has heat immediately available on all sides to keep it hot, then the stove works to reheat the pan. now as to care and expectations. don't take a brand new cast iron and try to cook an egg in it. cast iron is seasoned using carbon deposits from oils, that's the 'gunk' on it that you want to keep, and it protects it from sticking and rust. after a time, and with proper care, this seasoning only gets better and better. eventually it will form a practically non stick surface that will have your eggs sliding right off. i have a jet black pan that little can stick to. in the early days stick to frying things that don't tend to stick. in the exact opposite of teflon, the pan will only get better with each use. as for cleaning? who needs soap and scrubbing like with stainless steel? who needs to worry about harming that delicate teflon surface? with a well seasoned pan i can usually just rinse it in the sink and wipe with a paper towel. if something stuck a little, a light rub with a steel scrubbing pad takes care of it. added bonus, it makes for a great self defense weapon in a pinch. more bonus, treated right, the pan will last longer than you, your kids, and your grandkids. and more, when heated to high temperature they don't give off poisonous vapors like non stick pans do. if you way overheat them say, left a dry pan on high and you walked away for a while , the worst that happens is your burn off your seasoning and kitchen is full of regular smoke. then you re season and start over. okay, one last thing. they are the best for cooking food that goes from stove to oven. the absolute best corn bread is made by melting butter in a cast iron skillet on medium heat, pouring the batter in, waiting for it to bubble a bit, and then putting it in the oven to bake. the crust is heavenly. the same applies for pineapple upside down cake. you're missing out if you're just making that in a baking pan. no, get all that butter and brown sugar sizzling, drop in your pineapples and cherries, dump in the batter, then put it in the oven. with a properly seasoned pan the cake will fall right out. i suggest watching some videos about cast iron seasoning. it makes more sense when you can see what a good pan looks like and what it can do.","i don't know about you, but i don't think you can get rid of them without rubbing oils and salts into them. if i scrub my finger, i can get them off, but if i rub them with oils or salts i can't get them on. it's not like i have to rub oils into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get it off.","i don't know about you, but i have never used a cast iron cookware. i don't use it because it's too heavy. i use it for cooking. it's not like i'm going to use it to cook dinner, but it's just a way to cook it.","i don't think cigarette butts are disgusting. they are just a product of a chemical imbalance. i don't know if you've ever smoked a cigarette, but i'm sure you've."
 Parents should not tell their kids it's OK to be a failure.,"ok, so i already know that i'm going to get a lot of heat for this, and the kind of heat, so let me plea my case. it is my belief that each success, failure, good and bad person thing we meet experience brings us a step closer to who we truly are. that said, when we fail, go through a bad breakup, fall out with a close friend, etc. , therein lies the opportunity for growth, learning, and strength after some unavoidable pain and grief. here's my problem with that: in telling their child that it is ok to fail, which in some instances is totally fair and ok, there still lies a huge number of people who use this unconditional love as a means to blockade their inner feelings of inadequacy and mediocrity. i believe the most deep feelings of inner strength comes from within; it comes during the times you're sitting in a room, all alone with the weight of the world on your shoulders, and it being so heavy that you cease to feel anything at all. however, after this seemingly deadlocked state, something snaps and a fire bursts from within, and we become so consumed with the flame kindled from our own pain and emptiness, that we obsessively work to build a new self, and that self becomes volumes more indestructible than that which is cultivated after an extensive coddling period with mom and dad where you set off again at the suit of your leisure. this is the difference between intermittent rehab and surviving then living, and i mean being truly alive. it's in essence, the grown up version of when a little kid falls down and immediately runs to their parent's pantleg to cry and hide their face. i guess one could call it tough love, but because of the collectivist culture in america, this is the norm, because we have 'american family values.

want meaningful music. i know this has gone off topic but like i just keep typing and i can t stop. cardi b shouldn t have already gotten awards you have to earn those. like for many artists it takes a couple years. you have to grow. cardi b just came into the spotlight and in a year bam she s automatically the next madonna . like no, she needs to make real music. even ariana grande who charts without even trying she still makes music that s sounds unique to each album. like yours truly had kind of a 50 s vibe to it for multiple songs. my everything was a tiny bit r amp;b and pop. dangerous

but like i just keep typing and i can t stop. cardi b shouldn t have already gotten awards you have to earn those. like for many artists it takes a couple years. you have to grow. cardi b just came into the spotlight and in a year bam she s automatically the next madonna . like no, she needs to make real music. even ariana grande who charts without even trying she still makes music that s sounds unique to each album. like yours truly had kind of a 50 s vibe to it for multiple songs. my everything was a tiny bit r amp;b and pop. dangerous woman had it s own sound. sweetner has gone more hip hop. she s constantly reinventing her sound and doing a hell of a job of it. now i understand that cardi b hasn t had the time to release four albums but it all sounds the same. now i don t hate all rap but i just don t understand when it became this mainstream. that being said i think that all artists should be able to make it big without being a pop artist. who s to say what everybody likes. i don t know where this is going so i ll probably end it here. maybe i m just a bitch idk lol. also cardi b came out like last year or something hayley kiyoko released her first album this april. hayley kiyoko deserves so much love and fame. she sounds unique and writes her music from the heart. she helped me realize my true sexuality after repressing the thoughts over and over again because it was a sin . she taught me it was okay to be gay or bisexual in my case. okay imma go bye.",cmv: hayley kiyoko is way better than Cardi B,"what specific thing makes her super overrated? is it her english? the fact that you prefer another artist more? i understand the annoying part, just a little confused about why you think she's overrated?","i think cardi b deserves the award. she is the best new artist in the world. i think she deserves the awards because she is a good artist. i don't think she deserved the award because of the way she talks, but i think that she deserves it because she has been a great artist for a long time.","i don't know about you, but i don't think it's fair to say that she's the next madonna. she's not the first big lesbian artist, but she's definitely one of the most successful. that's not to say she doesn't have a unique sound, but that doesn't mean that she shouldn't be able to make it big without being a pop artist.","i don't know what you're talking about, but i don't think you're really trying to convince me that cardi b is the next madonna. if you want to make an argument, you're going to have to make a lot of assumptions about what you think

' just because you disagree with critiquing other leftists' tone does not mean that there might not be reasons for you to strategically modify your tone.,"i think it's important to remember that the left is a reactionary group, and the right is not. they are, by definition, reactionary. the left doesn't want to be racist sexist, they want to get rid of it, and that's what they're doing. the right isn't trying to change their rhetoric, they're trying to make it sound like the left isn't racist sexist. it's trying to convince people that they're not racist sexist and that they aren't","i don't think it's the fault of the sjw, but i think it is the responsibility of the left to change their rhetoric because it made them feel bad. it's not the left's fault, it's their fault.","i think the issue is that you're conflating 'being nice' with 'being racist' and 'being a racist sexist.'i don't think that's a good thing, but i think it's important to recognize that the left isn't going to be able to change their rhetoric because it makes them feel bad. the left is going to have a harder time changing their rhetoric, because they're going to lose the support of their base."

'disliking someone because of their race' is not racism. it is bigotry. however, people don't really like using that word 'bigoted' for some reason. it is the technically correct word, but people won't use it. why do people use the term. people can absolutely be racist against white people. i know some chinese people who are racist as fuck about white people. however, this isn't what anyone is talking about when they discuss 'reverse racism'. 'reverse racism' is a buzzword to describe anti white bigotry and sentiment which exists in minority communities, frequently because of perceived racism from the white people against the minorities. many white people feel that the backlash against white people has become too severe and now this 'reverse racism' bigotry threatens to over correct and cause even more racial animosity than existed when white people were originally being super racist. it is just a word that tries to sum up a lot of political sentiment at once and wrap it in a neat little package. lots of terms like this one homophobe describes anti gay people and attempts to accuse them of secretly fearing gay people fake news a borrowed term, which was originally used to describe actual false journalism, but is now used to insult tainted or biased journalism or the appearance of bias these terms are used to quickly allow people of similar persuasions to connect and recognize one another and share the sentiment without having to share a long winded conversation. they are literally 'memes'. they are almost never as simple as you are trying to make them. if you appreciate the context and historical background of the ideas being expressed by the speakers, you will realize why they are used and why people argue against them.","i don't know if you've heard of the term 'prejudice', but it's often used as a synonym for 'racism.'it's not that there's no such thing as racism, it's just that it's used to describe a certain group of people. it's like saying, 'it's okay to be racist against black people because they're black, but not against white people because you're black.'if you're talking about a group of","i think you're missing a key part of the problem here. racism against white people is not racism against black people. it's racism against people of different races. you can't be racist against a black person because you don't know the difference between black people and white people. the difference is that black people are more likely to be discriminated against than white people, but that doesn't mean that it isn't racism.","i don't think that you can be racist, but i think that it is possible to be prejudiced against a group of people based on their race. for example, if you were born in a country with a predominantly white population, you would be more likely to be racist than a white person. if you weren't born in that country, you wouldn't be racist either."

controlling all aspects of my life. i stopped having things to talk about in therapy, because i'm fortunately in a very healthy place right now. forcing me to go to therapy right now would not change much about my life other than the time it takes out my week and the money it costs. if you don't need therapy, then forcing someone into therapy isn't helpful. it would be a massive waste of time and money. therapy is important, but not necessary for everybody.","i think you're missing a key part of the problem here. we don't have a good therapist. we need a therapist to help us process our

 art critics are full of shit,"don t get me wrong, i love art. i m an artist myself. yes, obviously art can have deeper meanings, however for most art which is someone trying to copy something they see or abstract , they are reading into something that isn t there. the prime example being abstract art. you can t look at a jackson pollock splatter painting and tell how the artist was feeling, he just threw paint at the paper. and better yet, every expert will have a different opinion on his emotion, but claim theirs is factually correct. likewise, you can t pull deeper meaning from a portrait because it s just a portrait of a person."," art critics are full of shit : don t get me wrong, i love art. i m an artist myself. yes, obviously art can have deeper meanings, however for most art which is someone trying to copy something they see or abstract , they are reading into something that isn t there. the prime example being abstract art. you can t look at a jackson pollock splatter painting and tell how the artist was feeling, he just threw paint at the paper. and better yet, every expert will have a different opinion on his emotion, but claim theirs is factually correct. likewise, you can t pull deeper meaning from a portrait because it s just a portrait of a person.",I believe art can not have meaning because it is just a painting.,"i agree with your premise that a critic is unable to tell you what the artist meant or felt while creating a piece, unless they were there while it was produced and were told by the creator how they felt why it was produced. so i will focus on the other half of your argument about evoking emotions. firstly, it s important to note that how a piece speaks to you is unique to you alone and does not make a blanket statement about how it evokes emotion in all viewers, because everyone will view a piece subjectively from their own point of view. art evokes emotions, even if they are simple. if you look at a piece and think i like that and nothing more, the piece has still had an effect on your perception. you don t hate it, you don t feel nothing; you like it. this feeling is unique to you and in no way more or less important than the way it affects anyone else. but it did evoke an emotion. same if you were to see a 2 year old s scribble and think that s not very good . my point is, while i agree that art critics have no right to tell other people how they should feel about a piece of art, they are entitled to voice how the piece has spoken to and affects them, regardless of how deep or shallow or pretentious they sound.","i'm not sure what you mean by'reading into something that isn't there.'i mean, i can't pull deeper meaning from a painting because it's just a portrait of a person, but that doesn't mean that it's not there. you can't read into a painting and tell how the artist was feeling, because it just threw paint at the paper.","i don't think art critics are full of shit, but i do think they're full of crap for trying to pull meaning from splattered paint that is no different from if a 3 year old did it.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'art can have deeper meanings' or 'it can't have meaning because it is just a painting.'i think you're confusing 'art' with'meaning'.'meaning' is a subjective term, and it can be used to describe something that doesn't have any meaning."

 Artificial intelligence can't become conscious.,"i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there? ultimately, a computer is little more than a memory store and a processor. programs are stored in memory and their instructions are fed one by one into the processor. the instructions themselves are incredibly simple load and store numbers in memory, add or subtract these numbers, jump to a different instruction based on the result that's actually about all you need. all other instructions implemented by modern processors could be written in terms of these. computer memory doesn't have to be implemented via electrical transistors. you can use dots on a sheet of paper or a bunch of rocks sitting in a vast desert. likewise, the execution of program instructions doesn't have to be automated a mathematician could calculate by hand each instruction individually and write out the result on a piece of paper. it shouldn't make a difference as far as the software is concerned. what if our mathematician, hand computing the code to our ai, wrote out all of his work a complete trace of the program's execution? let's say he never erased anything. for each instruction in the program, he'd simply write out the instruction, its result, the address of the next instruction, and the addresses values of all updates to memory or, alternatively, a copy of all memory allocated by the program that includes these updates . after running the program to completion, what if our mathematician did it all again a second time? the same program, the same initial memory values. would a consciousness be created a second time, albeit having exactly the same experiences? a negative answer to this question would be very bizarre. how could the universe possibly remember that this particular program was already run once before and thereby force all subsequent executions to not develop consciousness? what if a layman came by and copied down the mathematician's written work, but without understanding it. why should it matter whether he understands what he's writing? arguably even the mathematician didn't understand the whole program, only each instruction in isolation. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, when written down, would automatically develop consciousness? what if our mathematician did not actually write out the steps of this second execution. what if he just read off all of his work from the first run and verified mentally that each instruction was processed correctly. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, if even just read , would automatically develop consciousness? why should the universe care whether or not someone is actively reading these symbols? why should the number of times the program develops consciousness depend on the number of people who simply read it? to change my view, you could explain to me how a program running on a modern future turing equivalent computer could develop consciousness, but would not if run on a computationally equivalent but mechanically simpler machine. alternatively, you could make the argument that my absurd consequences don't actually follow from my premises that there's a fundamental difference between what our mathematician does and what happens in an electronic fluidic mechanical computer. you could also argue that the human brain might actually be a hypercomputer and that hyper computation is a realistic direction for ai research, thereby invalidating my argument which depends on turing equivalence. what won't change my view, however, are arguments along the lines of 'since humans are conscious, therefore it must be possible to create a consciousness by simulating a human brain'. such a thing would mean that my absurd conclusions have to be true, and it seems disingenuous to hold an absurd view simply because it's the least absurd of all others that i currently know of."," Artificial intelligence can't become conscious. : i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there?

 We can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of AR-15-pattern rifles,"i'm pro 2a, and am licensed for concealed carry in several states. here's why: the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation , and quick amp; easy reloading. for sure, there are other competing semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal, but the proof is in the pudding: ar 15 popularity is through the roof compared to those. the mini 14 suffers from awkward slow reloads, and an odd method of inserting a magazine. just that alone is good reason to consider restricting its availability. these shooters rationally chose the best, most inexpensive, most effective gun for taking down masses of people. i believe that the overwhelming majority of ar 15 owners aren't mass shooters. the problem is that their guns are often taken or stolen. i believe that there's a line acceptable to the 2nd amendment between what's acceptable for civilian use, and what is restricted for military use. tanks and bombs are on one side of that. i believe that ar 15's should be on that same, off limits side. i also believe it's easily possible to draft a law to limit them. i saw that on a quora answer."," We can reduce mass shooting deaths by banning civilian purchase of AR-15-pattern rifles : i'm pro 2a, and am licensed for concealed carry in several states. here's why: the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. incredibly easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation , and quick amp; easy reloading. for sure, there are other competing semi auto platforms like mini 14 and fal, but the proof is in the pudding: ar 15 popularity is through the roof compared to those. the mini 14 suffers from awkward slow reloads, and an odd method of inserting a magazine. just that alone is good reason to consider restricting its availability. these shooters rationally chose the best, most inexpensive, most effective gun for taking down masses of people. i believe that the overwhelming majority of ar 15 owners aren't mass shooters. the problem is that their guns are often taken or stolen. i believe that there's a line acceptable to the 2nd amendment between what's acceptable for civilian use, and what is restricted for military use. tanks and bombs are on one side of that. i believe that ar 15's should be on that same, off limits side. i also believe it's easily possible to draft a law to limit them. i saw that on a quora answer.",i think the ar-15 should be restricted to military use.,"less than 1 of all ar 15s will be used to shoot up a school made up guess, but it's probably true i know there's a pattern, but millions of ar 15s are used entirely legally. you said something about guns being stolen, but that really doesn't happen that often iirc. if it does, just make gun safes mandatoryalso, the civilian ar 15 has never been used in the military. ever.","the ar 15 is one of the best light rifles ever designed. it's also the best weapon that can be used to take down people. the ar 15 has a very low recoil, and it's very easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with quick amp; easy reloading. the only problem i have with it is that it's a semi auto, and the only way to use it is to take it out of the hands of the person you're shooting","i don't think it's possible to reduce the number of mass shootings by banning civilian purchase of ar 15s. the problem is that the ar 15 is not the best weapon for mass shooting. it's the best rifle for a variety of purposes, and it's easy to use. i think the problem with banning civilian use of rifles is that it's easier to use than to use an ar 15.","i don't think the ar 15 is the best light rifle ever designed. i think that the fact that it's easy to put a ton of lead down range without recoil, with super easy manual of arms operation, and quick amp; easy reloading is a good reason to consider restricting it to military use."

 Crimes involving breach of trust should have more severe legal repercussions than the similar ones without.,"to elucidate my view, i'll try to frame an illustration. consider two acts of theft being performed which constitute as a crime under legal purview. case a: a man is walking down a lonely street late at night. suddenly, a mugger appears out of nowhere and robs him at gunpoint. case b: a man is walking down a busy street. a stranger walks to him seeking for help, describing a life and death situation. on humanitarian grounds, the man follows the stranger who leads him to not so happening street only to realize that it's all a setup. he is then robbed after being held at gun point. now, it is reasonable to state that the ultimate outcome in both of the cases was the man ended up being robbed. however when considered on a profound level, the varying experiences have resulted in different psychological impacts on that person. in case a, it is streetwise to avoid a deserted road to prevent from being taken advantage of. hence, the man would have estimated the probability of getting mugged and made a conscious decision. this would then conform to his existing prejudice about travelling isolated roads at night, which he would definitely avoid in the near future. however an experience from case b would have definitely scarred him by affecting his school of thought towards humanity. it would drive him to a conclusion that it is better off to avoid helping a human or anybody for that matter to avoid the risk of a false case. the next time he sees someone asking for help, even though his conscience would provoke him to provide assistance, his previous experience would say otherwise, thus deterring him from bestowing a respectable act of humanity. on an individual level it would not make a big difference, but consider the impact it would have if hundreds of individuals were robbed in a similar manner. it would then go on to be a preconceived notion that helping somebody en route to an isolated location would have disastrous implications. now imagine the plight of a person asking for help if his case was genuine. statistics suggest that majority of rape victims knew their perpetrators at least at a hierarchical level of an acquaintance. if this keeps on increasing individuals would be wary of accomplices, thus developing trust issues. events like this would make humans lean on individualism and would make them think twice before trusting other humans. and this, as far as the functioning of society is considered, would be the worst thing to happen to it. the basic intention of law is to ensure that humans act in a civilized manner in a society. however what use would the law be if society ceased to exist."," Crimes involving breach of

 The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist.,"note that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed. at the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless. i am very aware i am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber. a few of my thoughts summed up: 1. ken: hey did you hear about janet?

 Certain private companies like the social media/tech giants should be bound by similar free speech laws as the government.,"let me start off by saying i do not think we should tolerate intolerance, but at the same time i am against censorship. these laws exist for very valid reasons, and in some places have a few, also valid, exceptions, such as calling for violence against a person or group.

with billions of users. whether you agree with it or not, many people get their news from facebook. be it through news outlets posting articles on their pages, or groups sharing them, a very large number of people get their information about a plethora of topics from facebook. due to this fact, facebook has almost unprecedented power over what people can see. what can start off as extreme opinions that call for violence, ie something very clear cut and easy to determine, can slowly erode into something more grey and harder to define like 'no bigotry'. now i know this may seem like a slippery slope argument, but i am not saying it will necessarily turn into this, but simply highlighting that it is possible, and i don't think it should be. if facebook decided to update their policy to exclude things in a more vague way this could have far reaching impacts on the social sphere. there simply aren't any other platforms besides maybe twitter that can compete with facebook in terms of reaching a large audience. if you have an opinion or something you want to share, if you are barred from the widest used social media network, you are cut off from the largest way to share that idea. another perhaps more effective example would be if google skewed search results to favour a certain narrative. if searching something neutral like 'trump' in google brought up almost exclusively negative or positive articles, that would seriously impact how information was shared. google is perhaps the biggest example because they are not only a search engine, but the premier search engine

 Male and female heterosexuality are different,"based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective?
