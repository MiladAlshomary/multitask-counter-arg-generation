 The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions,"as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country."," The anger many liberal Americans feel towards republicans is justified given their party's actions : as a non american but one interested in politics, i've seen many discussions about american politics that have talked about the level of anger between the two different parties and they typically blame the two equally. a typical complaint from republicans is that they're treated like they're racist, misogynistic, bigoted, ignorant, selfish and or foolish. from their lies over actual policy issues like health their embrace of white identity politics republicans seem far more interested in cultural issues like nfl protests and sexual assault allegations than issues like the economy and america's standing in the world. their support of trump, roy moore and brett kavanaugh suggests they view improved treatment respect for women as something to be actively fought and a danger to men's justified dominance. their concerns over the deficit rapidly vanished once trump was elected suggesting the tea party movement was as much about race as anything. their support of tax cuts suggests they're mostly interested in short term economic and political benefits for the wealthy over any actual improvement to the country as a whole. their support of trump, a man who fits virtually every negative stereotype people have of republicans voters, makes them seem bigoted and ignorant, as well as suggesting they favour the interests of their party over their country.","the ultimate thing i can tell you is to always approach a subject with the conceptualization of perspective. you start off by assuming that the person you're talking to thinks your wrong, and unless your goal is to prove yourself right, the assumption that the person your talking to is either objectively wrong or unwilling to analyze demonstrable reality should be the option of last resort, and that is the point the conversation ends. imo, a conversation should aim to reach an elevated understanding of the truth for both parties even if one or both participants shift slightly then the conversation could be seen as at least productive. first and foremost, what is your criteria for changing your mind?","i'm not sure what you mean by 'bigoted' or 'bigotry'. i think you're talking about people who don't understand the difference between the two parties. i'm not saying that they're all bigots or bigots, but i'm saying that there are a lot of people who are bigoted, misogynistic, bigoted and ignorant. i don't think they're bigoted or bigoted at all. i think they are both bigots and big","i agree with you that the anger is justified, but i don't think it's the fault of the republicans. i think the anger comes from the fact that the democrats are the ones who have the most power in the country, and that they are the only ones that have the power to make the decisions that affect the country."

 god existing would make sense,"the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from? and 2, if god exists why is there so much suffering in the world. well think of it this way, as far as we know, humans are the smartest beings in the universe. even though animals have proven to be intelligent, like dolphins and monkeys, we can t teach them human things. you can t teach a monkey how to write, read, or build a house. they re just not smart enough. my point is we are the monkeys and god is the human. what if god is so powerful that before creation, nothing existed, and he was the one who created time and perception. the 2nd problem is people think that god doesn t care because there are horrible things happening in the world everyday. but a lot of suffering comes from other people s decisions. decisions like murder, abuse, rape, and slavery come from free will. imagine if every time someone was about to sin god stopped them, god would be the helicopter parent that no one would want, this is why god gives free will, because even though everything would be peaceful, it would be slavery. humans have always preferred dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. the problem with many christians is that they take the bible literally. the bible is probably like 55 true because the old testament is older than written language so the only way to spread the information was through words. many hardcore christians are too focused on the details and forget that the morals and point of the stories are what s important. i also believe that some of the bible was corrupted and used to control people and make money, because when people are scared, they re easier to control. i honestly don t care if you re a christian or an atheist because it doesn t effect me at all. but if you can t come up with a reasonable argument to why god doesn t exist then i won t take you seriously. k, thanks for reading now change my mind."," god existing would make sense : the two biggest problems with people believing in god is 1, if god exists where did he come from?

it means you can believe there is a god but there is no current way to prove it. your view is that it simply makes sense. in essence, you invoke occam's razor: the most likely explanation the correct. the problem with this, is that while a divine ruler is possible or at least not impossible it certainly is not the most likely, in comparison to other ideas. so what do we know? we know the organic components necessary to for life to form namely amino acids were present on archean earth some 3. 5 bya and that these components are themselves formed through inorganic processes. we know certain organisms can self organize and all organisms can replicate sexually or asexually, and that large structures such as galaxies form by rules set forth by the principles of physics to form and unravel. we know evolution can explain forms and behaviors and mechanisms of life of all kinds: from flight in birds and chemical communication in arthropods to immune systems and four chambered hearts. there are explanations for the vast majority of systems both biotic and abiotic on our earth. but then, you also mention intelligence and morality. you also mention the christian god as the god likely orchestrating our reality. let's examine these two. intelligence and morality are both very relative. we consider ourselves the most intelligent animals on earth, but we cannot organize as precisely as an ant colony. we can't echolocate our prey and we can't hunt by smell or hearing. these activities take intelligence, albeit a different kind. but let's isolate to human intelligence. chimpanzees and bonobos are in their stone age. they use the same tools our ancestors homo habilis did: rocks, sticks, grasses. given time, would they reach our 'level'? current studies suggest they could, just as we did. morality is a human construct to be sure, in that we give it a name. but all social animals have rules. wolf packs, lion prides, baboon troops and even flocks of geese follow social constraints to keep the peace in their ideal forms. isn't that what morality is? rules to keep the peace? additionally, if the christian god is the head honcho, why do all human civilizations have a set of moral and ethical rules, even if they were unexposed to the christian god in his entirety? the secular answer is that it makes evolutionary sense to preserve the species. i offer not proof that god is not real, but simply some evidence that it doesn't necessarily 'make the most sense'. that said, it leaves us to wonder who sparked the original organism? or spurred the big bang? i suppose short of god descending to our plane, it remains but an issue of faith. forgot a thing","i don't think there is any reason to believe that god exists. i think there are plenty of reasons to believe in god, but i don't see any reason why you can't believe in a god that doesn't exist.","i don't think it would make sense for god to exist, but i think it makes sense for him to exist."
 A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice,"this seemed to offend people and i don't get why. and the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. and all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual romantic partners. it's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever. we have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. we tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best. there's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and i don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. and i think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition."," A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice : this seemed to offend people and i don't get why. and the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. and all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual romantic partners. it's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever. we have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. we tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best. there's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and i don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. and i think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition.","yeh the thing is i wouldn't want to take such a treatment. being trans is really crap, but it's who i am. if you took that from me then i'd be someone else. besides, if we actually did manage to produce such a thing, why not instead target it at transphobia and homophobia? if everyone took it and was no longer bigotted at all then surely that would be the better world.",i don't think it's fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to try it.,"i don't think it would be objectively a better choice to treat gender dysphoria, but i think it's important to note that there are a lot of people who don't want to transition to the opposite gender. for example, i have a friend who is transgender, and she has been transitioning for a long time. she was diagnosed with dysphoria when she was 16, and has been on hormone therapy for a few years now. she is currently undergoing hormone therapy, but she is"

 Companies should have to interview one minority for each open job.,"in 2003 the nfl implemented the 'rooney rule' to encourage diversity. that rule says any team hiring a new coach or gm must interview at least one black person. it's been a great rule and one that should be expanded and implemented nationwide imo. this would go a long ways to getting real diversity into leadership positions and industries that are typically male dominated. this would go a long way to alleviating it. and it really wouldn't cost anyone anything anyway. if a company is going to interview 100 people for a position there's no real reason one of those 100 can't be someone who isn't a white, heterosexual, cis man. keep in mind that i'm including women in the definition of minorities so even in areas that are extremely white there are always going to be a minority who is qualified for the work. this isn't meant to be a punishment for white men and i'm open to waivers in cases where it's simply impossible or unreasonable to hire minorities but i suspect those would be few and far between."," Companies should have to interview one minority for each open job. : in 2003 the nfl implemented the 'rooney rule' to encourage diversity. that rule says any team hiring a new coach or gm must interview at least one black person. it's been a great rule and one that should be expanded and implemented nationwide imo. this would go a long ways to getting real diversity into leadership positions and industries that are typically male dominated. this would go a long way to alleviating it. and it really wouldn't cost anyone anything anyway. if a company is going to interview 100 people for a position there's no real reason one of those 100 can't be someone who isn't a white, heterosexual, cis man. keep in mind that i'm including women in the definition of minorities so even in areas that are extremely white there are always going to be a minority who is qualified for the work. this isn't meant to be a punishment for white men and i'm open to waivers in cases where it's simply impossible or unreasonable to hire minorities but i suspect those would be few and far between.","what if you're a tiny company in bumfuck, nowhere that happens to have no minorities qualified for the job, or no minorities at all? some jobs need quite specific skill. what happens when your town has just 5 people qualified to do a specific kind of welding, none of which happens to be a minority? also, this kind of thing is trivially worked around. it's easy to satisfy such requirements while not really changing anything.","i'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but i think it's important to note that the nfl is not the only organization in the world that has a diversity policy. it's not just about hiring minorities, it's about hiring people who are good at what they do. if you want to hire a black person, you're going to have to hire people who aren't white, heterosexual, cis man, cis woman, etc. you're not going to","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to note that this isn't the first time a company has had to hire a minority for a position. in the past, the majority of hiring decisions were made based on race, gender, and sexual orientation. in this case, it's not about race, but rather gender. if a company is hiring a black person, they're hiring a white person. if they hire a white man, they"

and correct me if i'm wrong, but didn't the north have a policy that escaped slaves were to be returned to their owners if caught? my position is this: the agrarian nature of the south required man power. the north had become more industrial and therefore did not depend on slave labour to thrive. the easiest way to cripple the south's economy would be to deprive them of their means of production while conveniently taking the moral high ground. i can't comment on the south's racism, but my feeling is that their livelihoods were more important to them than arbitrarily oppressing a race of people. could the south have really been so opposed to blacks being free that mothers would willingly sacrifice their sons to uphold slavery?

'there are urban areas in sweden which have been claimed to be no go zones. however, the swedish government states that 'no go zones', where 'criminality and gangs have taken over and where the emergency services do not dare to go' do not exist, while acknowledging that there are areas 'increasingly marred by crime, social unrest and insecurity'. 68 69 the fact checking site snopes. com agrees the idea of 'no go zones' where police cannot enter is false. 70 a 2016 report from the swedish police mapped 53 so called 'exposed' areas utsatta omr den , of which 15 were 'particularly exposed'. an 'exposed area' is an area with low socioeconomic status and the area is affected by criminality. a 'particularly exposed' area is defined by an unwillingness to participate in legal proceedings, difficulties for the police to carry out their mission, parallel social structures, violent extremism and finally proximity to other exposed areas. these definitions are used to adapt their procedures when working in these areas, for example bringing certain equipment and working in pairs when in a 'particularly exposed area'. 71 the vulnerable areas are continually improving, but if all the refugees were integrated and not dumped into ghettos, the problems would be reduced greatly. as far as refugees in general, one would hope that simple humanity would step up. literally half of the population of syria is either an internal refugee or outside the border. the number of refugees from yemen is about the same as the entire population of new york state. 94million people around the world don't have access to water. the idea that the country that produces about a quarter of the world's gdp us takes in less than 1 of the refugees disgusts me as an american citizen. but to take a completely pragmatic view, desperation breeds radicalism. if we want to do something about reducing the number of terrorists making sure that they are not in a position where they literally have nothing to lose is a good place to start. knowing that you have nothing, no chance of gaining anything, no hope for your children, constant war, and that the richest countries of the world are quarantining you there forever to die in hell is a great recruiting tool for jihadis",i don't think it's fair to say that the refugees are suffering because they have no idea what they're going to do in the future. i think they're suffering because there's no way to know what the future will be like for them.,there is nothing morally wrong about countries not accepting refugees or middle eastern muslim immigrants. there is nothing 'wrong' with countries refusing to accept refugees if it is in the host countries interes.

' it's never safe, driving is not a passive action. 'complacency kills' is a good motto to repeat in your head. i would hate for you to be the person that dies because you drove the same road to work everyday for 8 years but were looking at your phone the day that road crews decided to block off that lane or a tree fell the night before or a dog dashes across the street. you are texting in the slow lane because you are assuming it is safer but in reality the fact that you think that shows that you are becoming too complacent and that makes it all the more dangerous. i'm being tough on you because my gf looked down at her phone for one second and didn't notice that the curb suddenly jutted out so she clipped it and rolled her car over. driving for 8 years at that point, and only going 35 miles an hour on a straight, empty road that she was very familiar with. luckily she was ok but it was certainly life changing for all the wrong reasons.","i don't think it's a good idea to be in the slow lane at all. if you're in the middle of the lane, you're going to have a lot of time to think about what's in front of you and to your left, and you're not going to be able to see what's going on behind you.","i don't think it's as safe as people make it out to be, but i think you're missing a key piece on determining the safety of using your phone on the highway. if you're in the slow lane, you have to be far away from the person in front of you and you don't have to worry about what's in the way of your lane."
" As a white man, the Sarah Jeong controversy is a nonissue for my demographic.","in my opinion, there are a few reasons why this notion is flawed. 1. as descendants of the perpetrators of almost unspeakable atrocities and as white males in the midst of a society in which many, if not most, minority groups have been made substantially worse off largely by white male authorities , being okay with being held accountable for that through humor is kinda the least we can do. i know this is gonna trigger a lot of whining about white guilt cuck and whatnot, and this is a bit of a minor point, but hear me out. america, as an idea, is built on a foundation of settler colonialism, slavery, and racism which is all too often ignored. as white people, whether or not that foundation was our own design, you can be damn sure we benefitted from it. one could easily make an argument that any wealth produced by whites in america is essentially stolen goods, since its genesis is free read: stolen land and labor. i m not sure i personally buy that argument, but frankly, i m amazed that even the most progressive social justice activists are mostly content to joke about cancelling white people which seems inherently silly and really hard to misconstrue as genuinely hateful to me . 2. privilege is pretty resilient. as an example of this, i ll use south africa. even after the anc assumes the leading role in south african government, massive differences between races persist. for example, in 2008, about 13. 6 of black south africans were hiv positive. however, according to the same study, only 0. 3 of white south africans were hiv positive. for comparison, in 2008 about 0. 2 of canadians were hiv positive. link to study: i m on mobile right now so i can t link too many more studies like this but hopefully it will suffice to say that this is but one example of how much better off ruling demographics end up even long after they exit rule. this makes me skeptical of the claim that someday racism against whites will be worse than it is now, justifying preemptive action. 3. equating racism against whites with other forms of discrimination is bad because it s an enormous false equivalency. so to clarify, in an ideal world, yes, i d agree in an abstract sense that racism is bad and shouldn t ever happen. however, in our world, lots of people are uniquely targeted by the world. black people are far more likely to be arrested, there s an ongoing epidemic of suicide in the lgbtq community, and hell, there are active concentration camps for hispanic children this side of the border. in such a world, not only is it really hard for me to care about some edgy tweets some fascist dug up, but it s also really hard for me to not feel really bad about trivializing these real

 Lord Farquaad's imperfect rule of DuLoc was nonetheless righteous for its time and his deposition was unjust,"what we have seen of duloc is that it is a cleanly and civil community, a beacon of modernity in a dangerous and backwards medieval time wrought with criminals, beasts, and brutal natural environments. he is the overseer of a relatively safe and burgeoning community, a rare sight given the circumstances. the fact of the matter that many fail to discuss is that fairytale creatures truly have no place in duloc. such fairytale creatures largely fail to be contributing members of society. they cannot pay taxes, they largely cannot work, yet they unfairly reap the rewards of farquaad's administration. additionally, such fairytale creatures, despite their charm, are frequently troublemakers that disturb the peace. the chaos they sow when banished to shrek's swamp serves as a prime example. while he may have overreacted when sentencing shrek to death, his demise by the dragon was uncalled for and a demonstrably better outcome could have easily be obtained."," Lord Farquaad's imperfect rule of DuLoc was nonetheless righteous for its time and his deposition was unjust : what we have seen of duloc is that it is a cleanly and civil community, a beacon of modernity in a dangerous and backwards medieval time wrought with criminals, beasts, and brutal natural environments. he is the overseer of a relatively safe and burgeoning community, a rare sight given the circumstances. the fact of the matter that many fail to discuss is that fairytale creatures truly have no place in duloc. such fairytale creatures largely fail to be contributing members of society. they cannot pay taxes, they largely cannot work, yet they unfairly reap the rewards of farquaad's administration. additionally, such fairytale creatures, despite their charm, are frequently troublemakers that disturb the peace. the chaos they sow when banished to shrek's swamp serves as a prime example. while he may have overreacted when sentencing shrek to death, his demise by the dragon was uncalled for and a demonstrably better outcome could have easily be obtained.",this comment will probably get deleted but i just had to say how great this post was lmao,"duloc is not a 'cleanly and civil community', it is a 'civil community' that has a good reputation for being a good place to live. it is also a'safe and burgeoning community' because it is the only place in the world where there is a fairytale community.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'perfect' or 'unjust' in your title, but i think it's important to remember that farquaad is not a perfect ruler. he's not perfect, but he's a good ruler, and he has a lot of power over his people. he has the power to banish fairytale creatures from duloc, but that doesn't mean that he's perfect. he doesn't have to be perfect, he just"

 Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today.,"this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks."," Black people who blame everything on racism are the reason race politics are so prevalent today. : this is stupid and is not likely to happen. obviously racist people still exist, but, you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against by one in the modern day. this is another point i would like to make, so, ask for elaboration if you want it. thanks.","i see two major problems with your argument. first, you're using the phrase 'not likely' a lot. let's use a different example. your kid is not likely to get shot by a school shooter. when you compare the number of schools that exist in america over 100,000 to the number of school shootings that have taken place less than 500 in 175 years , we can definitively say that it is 'not likely' that your child will be the victim of a school shooting. the thing is, unsurprisingly, this doesn't make people feel better about school shootings. they still happen often enough for it to be something terrifying and abhorrent to most people, and when it does happen, it has long term and wide reaching affects. the whole nation is rocked by it, and the community that it happens in is shaken for years to come. not to mention that the lives of the survivors and of the victim's families are changed forever. all it takes is for one kid to get shot at school for thousands of kids to be afraid to go to school the next day. it's the same thing with racial issues. all it takes is one instance of blatant, public racism for black people everywhere to be afraid. so even if we agree that being the victim of racism isn't likely, is it likely enough to make whole communities afraid? that leads to the second point. racism is not always blatant. it doesn't always happen in a way that makes it clear that it is racism. most examples of racism are subtle. for example, several studies have shown that people with traditionally non white names have a harder time getting a job interview, even when they have the same qualifications as applicants with traditionally white names: since 1989, whites receive on average 36 more callbacks than african americans, and 24 more callbacks than latinos. we observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against african americans over the past 25 years, although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against latinos. so when you say, 'you likely did not get rejected from that job because you are black' we can demonstrate that that isn't true. that doesn't mean that betty in hr is a raging racist who dreams of dawning a klan hood one day. it could be that even she doesn't know why john seems more qualified than hakeem. it's just a gut feeling. the same reason why my grandmother always locked the car doors when we were sitting at a stop light and a black man was waiting to cross the street. she never did that with white men. this kind of subtle racism is the most prevalent, and the hardest to prove as well. i can't prove that your dad was stopped at that store because he was black. but how do you know that it wasn't, and what makes you believe that subtle acts of racial bias aren't as pervasive as people who experience them say they are?","i don't think it's stupid to be racist, but it's not stupid to not be racist. if you're not racist, then you are not likely to meet one or even be discriminated against.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'race politics', but i think it's important to note that there are a lot of black people who blame everything on racism. it's not that black people blame everything, it's that they blame it on the fact that they're black. i'm sure there are plenty of white people who don't blame racism, but i don't think that's the case."
 I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome.,"the title shows my basic premise when it comes to politics. i think people should have no governmental obstacles to stop them from being able to succeed from their own merit. i think that if you are a hard worker, you deserve to be able to work your way to the top, seek out knowledge, and stand above those who weren t able to succeed the way you did. you should be able to work your way from the bottom and get to be a ceo or the president or any other top level position if you work and learn and push yourself to the top. i don t think for instance, having affirmative action programs are a good idea. the way i understand it, they try to push for diversity by for example, if two people both have the same qualifications, or indeed even if one is higher than the other, the one with lower or equal standards could get accepted instead, solely based on their race or other criteria, even if they were less qualified. another example is if you have 3 people in a room, a, b, and c. a earns a lot of money, and gets taxed at a higher rate than both b and c, despite the fact that a works harder than b and c. just because he has more money, that money is redistributed to b and c so they can also get a higher standard of living, even though they didn t work for it like a did. these kinds of ideas i think are counterproductive, especially the more they increase. in my last example for instance, if everyone was to give all their money to d, who then combined all the money and then gave it back to a b and c equally, then you end up with a problem. if a knows their money will just be given back to the b and c anyway, why try and make so much more money? and b and c, why would they try and earn more money if they know that they can just rely on a to get it for them? so now a, b, and c all have less incentive to work, and therefore they all have less money. welfare programs promote this kind of behavior as well. instead if we took it in the complete opposite direction, and they all kept everything they had, then they would all have an incentive to earn more money. a could get richer, and even employ b and c if they were willing to work for a, and b and c would realize that they couldn t just rely on a to get everything for them. they would have to work in order to survive, and would therefore have to earn things for themselves. they all have an incentive to work, and therefore must better themselves to earn things. this principle can be applied to many things, such as speech, wherein the opportunity would be everyone can speak their mind. if b and c decided that they didn t like something that a said, they could simply not associate with him. they could instead speak how they wanted to, and tell a to buzz off, and associate with what they want. if outcome was put into place, and a was not allowed to say those things that b and c didn t like, then b and c would feel more comfortable, but a wouldn t be allowed to express their opinions, and would therefore lead to a less diverse group of opinions and discussions. also, if a was to open a shop and discriminate against gay people for instance, if they all had equal opportunity, then b could open up a shop, and c might decide that they don t like a s policy that much, or perhaps c is gay as well, and decide to go to b. this would rob a of his business, and he would either be forced to change his policy, or lose money because of the customers that didn t like his policy or were refused because of it. if they all had the same outcome, this couldn t happen, but if a was religious, and didn t want to serve these gay people for instance, then it would violate his freedom of religion. i should also mention that i think this is better from a moral standpoint as well, not just a logical standpoint. in the first example, b and c are taking a s money and giving it to themselves just because a earned more than they did. they are taking away a s right to their money. in the second example, b and c are taking away a s right to speak as he chooses. he said something they didn t like or agree with, and said by law, you cannot say that anymore. i should make a distinction that this is different if a said i am going to kill you. that implies he is about to attack you, and you should be able to criminalize that. i m referring to if a said b should die in a fire. that s not nice, but it doesn t imply action. a shouldn t be criminalized for saying something mean. in the third example, b and c are taking away a s right to choose who a gives their service to. no one has a right to someone s services. in this example, the government is forcing a to do something that he doesn t want to do, violating his religious beliefs as well. that is my stance when it comes to politics. change my view!"," I believe that Equality of Opportunity is more important than Equality of Outcome. : the title

change my view!","i wrote this quickly so i apologize if it isn't clear is rushed. i legitimately disagree with some of your claims so i looked through the responses and didn't find any that aligned with my own objections though there are a lot of responses so if you have come across this one already, then i apologize . your thought process is great. you are beginning with a certain simplified worldview and then elaborating based on motivation, taxation, notions of what makes a good society, a good economy etc. the fundamental problem is that your initial simplified worldview is fictional or, at the very least, it does not apply in general circumstances and is thereby of only partial use meaning that you ought to supplement your view with other views when the initial conditions do not hold . i will try to illustrate this in two ways. first, you begin with 3 people in a room, a, b, and c, and you ask us to imagine that a works harder than b and c, and that a thereby earns more money. a is taxed higher and yada yada yada. this is indeed a possible circumstance. but it is not the only possible circumstance. suppose, instead, you have 3 people a, b, and c. they are clones, equal in every way. equally hard working, equally smart, equally qualified etc. there is one job opening available in this room. all three apply. all are equally qualified, but one job cannot be given to three people. accordingly, an arbitrary decision process results in person a obtaining the job. person a now makes a bunch of money and person b and c have none. the inequality in outcome, in this circumstance, is not based on hard work, or skill, determination, merit, intelligence whatever else you want to apply. i propose that the situation i have put forth, is just as relevant to the world as the situation you put forth. but your conclusions do not apply to this new situation. i would go even further though i don't expect you to be convinced by this, and making such an argument isn't essential to making my point in this post and say that the meritocracy is fictional. second, inequality in opportunity is readily apparent in the world today. i was born into a middle class family with disposable income. i was raised in an enriched environment with lots of books, emphasis on education, sports, solid reinforcement etc. not everyone has such opportunities. i have friends who had more opportunity than me. they went to private school, international trips, family members in high ranking positions in notable companies who could get them job placements. i have friends who had fewer opportunities than me. raised by single parents who had to work multiple low paying jobs just to afford rent and food, and thereby couldn't direct as much time money to environmental enrichment. this is obvious not to mention political inequalities in marginalized groups, racial inequalities, sexual, other possible inequalities , but a more general point is worth making here. there is a common tendency illustrated in your own case to suppose that intelligence, hard work, resourcefulness, cleverness, cut throatness etc. are for some reason starting properties, rather than outcomes themselves. that is, you are assuming that 'hard worker' is something that people are born with and that this somehow serves as a starting point for an idealized equality of opportunity world. this is certainly not the case. being a 'hard worker' is as much the outcome of a process as is wealth inequality. is there even such thing is equality of opportunity? two general points in closing. 1. inequality of outcome will facilitate social unrest, if that inequality is sufficiently pronounced. social unrest can be extremely dangerous, and limiting social unrest is a benefit for those with and without power. if in your hypothetical room person b and c could get very pissed off and decide to burn the room down and overthrow the system that allows person a to have inequality of outcome, it may be in person a's best interest to give up some of what he has earned, so as to perpetuate the social conditions in the room that allow him such benefits. 2. there is a silly tendency to attribute social power success to something innate inherent in a person. and this long predates genetics and the notion that genetics determine who you are is generally a very silly claim and widely known to be such among biologists experts think of monarchs who had their inherent social power justified through god and, oddly, those who overthrew those monarchs also had their social power justified through the same god. such appeals to innateness may explain inequalities of outcome though other explanations are possible or may make such inequalities seem inevitable ostensible inevitability is a powerful mechanism of social control . but why does some innate inherent quality justify inequality of outcome? i'm not sure so i bring this up to point that out to you and others. why does innate difference justify inequality of outcome? it seems to me that, in some areas at least we generally do not think this to be the case eg. in democracies today at least in the west we generally allow equal political power to each individual at least as an ideal , regardless of whether the person is a genius or an idiot, wealthy or poor, man or woman, white or black, tall or short.","the problem with affirmative action programs is that they are designed to encourage people to work harder, rather than to reward them for their hard work. for example, if you have a job that requires you to work hard, you will be rewarded for your hard work, but if you don't, you won't be rewarded. if you work hard enough, you'll get rewarded for it, but you'll be punished for it.","the problem with affirmative

those teen goths saw it as expressing their identity and that other people just didn t get. childhood transgenderism feels like the same fad, but with extremely permanent repercussions. i m truly disturbed that the current policy at least where i work is to encourage this. i cringe hard when i picture myself at 14 and 15, but what if those identity choices had been permanent? imagine a 16 year old girl who insists she s a man because she always was a tom boy. imagine she has her breasts removed, and then for the rest of her life she has to justify that decision she made as a teenager. she can t say it was just a phase now. it s irreversible and we have no idea what the implications of it are yet. this is my view and i don t want to be right. so? change my view?","you're correlating too many arguments under a single statement, so that as long as one can't be convincingly refuted your original belief can remain intact. for example, trans as a mental illness is a completely different discussion from whether or not it's ok to let a child make any sort of permanent decision.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to remember that transgenderism is not a medical issue. it's a social issue, and it's not something that can be cured by surgery.","i don't think it's a mental illness, but i do think it is a physical illness. i don't know if it's mental illness or not, but it's not a medical illness. it's just a psychological illness."

 The future of humanity is NOT in outer space,"i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system? well, first let's consider our reasons for colonizing these planets in the first place. most of these planets are either too hot or too cold to sustain life, with the most likely exception being mars, venus, and a number of moons, including our own. even so, these planets present incredibly hostile environments; they are home to extreme temperatures, little to no oxygen, and most likely no liquid water whatsoever. there are theories as to how we might be able to terraform these planets, making it possible for humans to survive there, although needless to say that won't be an easy process. while there is little doubt earth is becoming less habitable to humans, the reality is we currently have water, oxygen, food, plant life, and temperatures humans can survive in almost everywhere on the planet. if it is possible to terraform an environment which is as hostile as mars or venus, shouldn't it also be possible to re terraform earth? wouldn't this be much easier, and a much more productive use of our resources? so perhaps we don't need to colonize other planets, but they are still home to a number of resources that we can benefit from here on earth, right? maybe we can simply set up mining stations throughout our solar system, and bring minerals back to earth. the problem with this is that inter planar travel costs a lot of resources as it is. transporting mining equipment and mining staff to another planet, and transporting a significant quantity valuable minerals back to earth would be extremely cost inefficient. admittedly we would also be granted access to entire planets worth of raw materials, so some might argue that the trade off is ultimately worth it, but keep in mind that we would also need to burn enormous amounts of fuel, and since we currently depend primarily on fossil fuels, we most likely wouldn't be able to find anything of comparable value anywhere else in the solar system. remember that we are currently facing the risk of running out of fossil fuels entirely, and that they are, as the name suggests, made of organic material. with this in mind, it is almost impossible that we will find anything like it elsewhere in our solar system. like i said at the beginning, this is a massive bummer, and i truly hope i'm wrong. i do not have a background in science, and there is a good chance i don't know what i'm talking about, so if you are able to change my view, i would be extremely happy. that being said, if i'm right, i believe the scientific community would be better off recognizing this hard truth, and dedicating their resources to something more productive than space travel, such as researching ways to make the earth continue to be inhabitable."," The future of humanity is NOT in outer space : i truly hope you can change my view on this, since i am very well aware that this is both an incredibly boring and depressing view to have. i do not have a background in science, and i am very well aware that people much more accomplished than myself would strongly disagree, but that being said, the more i look at the facts, the less likely it seems that anything productive can be accomplished by colonizing, or even traveling to, other planets. let's look at what we currently know about space travel: the nearest star, other than the sun, is over four light years away from the earth. keep in mind that the planets of this star system most likely won't be able to sustain human life, meaning that all the individuals and equipment required to terraform and repopulate another planet one which we know basically nothing about would have to be transported more than four light years away from earth. additionally, the people who would go on such an expion would be unable to communicate with anyone on earth, since we are unable to send messages so far away using any kind of technology that currently exists, and would be completely unable to return. with this in mind, it seems nearly impossible that we will ever be able to reach, let alone colonize another star system, but what about our own star system?

 Weed is bad for you. Smoking it has many short and long term consequences.,"everyone likes to argue that it's not as bad as other drugs but it still can be very psychologically addictive and damaging. smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes which society has agreed are bad for you so why does everyone pretend that this is ok? everyday it seems i can find new studies that have more and more downsides to marijuana smoke in the short and long term and i just don't understand why people seem to think that there are no downsides here. medicinally it still is considered to have no medical benefits and i don't really see how it possibly could as current understanding of thc which is the strongest known cannabinoid in marijuana seems to cause more harm then good. i can understand that cbd is being shown to be successful in treating things like chronic pain and anxiety however thc vastly outnumbers cbd in weed and smoking to get these effects seems counterproductive. i feel as if medical marijuana companies are trying to piggyback off the false notion that it's a harmless drug and push it onto people asap similarly to how tobacco companies operated back in the day. at the end of the day these companies are profitable off addiction and they have ulterior motives when it comes to testing this stuff. they say things like it's not as bad as alcohol or tobacco cigarette but to me this seems like a logical fallacy as one could really justify any reckless behavior this way. one of the main reasons i've been so torn up on this lately is that a lot of my friends including my girlfriend started smoking and have definitely changed. it bothers me. it bothers me that they started presumingly under age and were not fully aware of the consequences and now a lot seem to have dependencies on the drug. they claim it's fine but in my eyes it's the same as smoking as cigarette, at least in the physical sense, and if people smoke tobacco to unwind most people would agree that it's very unhealthy to form habits around that. at the end of the day, smoking every once in a while won't kill you in the same way occasionally smoking a cig won't kill you, however i believe that having a dependency on anything is not healthy and weed is no exception."," Weed is bad for you.

although it does have similarity to the other article with cons. it newly states that marijuana has never been proved to be linked to lung cancer, and that a link hasnt been found. they say thats due to limited time for research. because its illegal on a federal lvl research is hard to come by until recently. it also states that in animal research there are things in marijuana that might actually fight tumor growth, but further research is needed. and people have actually used weed to help cancer. which supposedly worked in this young child, that was given suppliments to try to fight cancer. i would link this but im drunk and jus chillin and its gonna take awhile. i dont think weed cures cancer, especially if you smoke it, but i think its possible that it did something to help this girl. i personally only use a vaporizer, and drink very rarely. heres the part where i kinda support part of your argument, weed can be very addictive and is totally a gateway drug. although the other than weed and alcohol iv just tried xanax ones or twice. xanax is powerful, dangerous, not in a psychedelic way, but in a ruins your life and you forget everything tired depressed way. but ever since iv started smoking weed the habit only gets bigger, now its pretty much daily, every night before i go to sleep i always chill w a quick smoke, always vaporizing, which release no tar like smoking does. it only heats the thc and cbd to a temperature where it is active, kinda what they do to make weed ready for edibles, before adding it to the mixture. there are many studies showing that the smokes chemicals and tar excretion from vaporizing is significantly less from just regularly smoking weed like in a joint. and when weed is smoked through a water pipe bong some of the tar and carcinogens are removed through the water. i digress, i kinda wish i never started smoking, its a nessesity that i spend a good amount of money on and that makes me happy. i want to do most things high, and pretty much always smoke if i got weed. and i always can get some so i always buy some. i am noted as an extremely intelligent person, weird wording but me and all my siblings have gone to ivy league schools harvard, standford etc i am not trying to flex, but because i started generally young, i feel that smoking weed has limited my potential. i think if i stopped for a long period of time, my great memory would come back, but come on did i ever have a great memory or do i just think i had a better one. sometimes i take a week break to reset tolerance a bit, or if i really need to focus on something, out of weed etc but i always have the intention to start again in a week and always do. its pretty much impossible to break the cycle because why the fuck would i break the cycle. smoking weed is just, great sometimes. its not meth its not coke, but it can really let you appreciate life, especially music. its not too late for me, i hope. i dont fit in with stoners, or dealers. i fit in with smart sober people. when im sober. when im high im just a responsible guy whos tryna smoke because everything fucking sucks. im sorry for the rant, im pretty sure iv been writing this for over around 45 minutes. what if this post was archived or some shit and i just wasted all that fucking time lmfaoooo please nooooo. i wonder if any of this even makes sense. dont start smoking. its not good for you, and in my opinion somehow extremely addictive, without being addictive at all. the analogy i always use is, weeds like pizza for pizza lovers , its good as fuck. its not nicotine, or opiods. it just tastes good, or feels good. and you kinda want it, when your sad, when your happy, when your bored, when your in a great mood. pizza could just make life fucking great if we could eat it all the time without gaining weight. well some people see the possibly negative effects because weight gain is visible but weed abuse isnt. if i could eat pizza all day any day. i truly would cause that shit is great. and although weed so far isnt a gateway drug for me. you'll start w it and move on to something else especially if its offered to you. acid overall isnt horrible, it isnt addictive and most people take it to have a crazy trip extremely rarely, others take it every weekend, but that is the low 1 or less. coke, meth, heroin, crack, are some of the worst most addictive terrible things in the word, they are pure man made chemicals, that fuck up your appearance not really coke but the others yes , and are so extremely addictive that you literally need them. immediatly. while molly mdma and acid are on the safer side. xanax and alcohol are very similar to weed, alcohols more addictive and definetly impairs driving way more than weed. but never drive with any drug in system. xanax is the most addictive and most dangerous. its a legal prescribed medicine that you can overdose on like every thing iv mentioned except weed and it completely changes personality and destroys memory and emotions. i need to stop writing damn. goodnight bro. i hope you read this, please argue w me","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to note that marijuana is not the same as alcohol or tobacco. alcohol and tobacco are very different things, but they are different things. alcohol is the same thing, but it's a different substance. marijuana is different from alcohol, because it's different in the way that alcohol is different. it's not as bad as alcohol, but that doesn't mean it's the same.","i don't think it's a logical fallacy to say that smoking weed is bad for you no matter how you cut it. however, i do think that there are downsides to smoking weed. first of all, it's not the same as smoking cigarettes. it's the same with alcohol and tobacco. second, it is the same thing with marijuana. you can't smoke weed because you don't want to be addicted to it. third, you can smoke marijuana because you want to"

 The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive.,"what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies."," The US government giving financial aid to students and to universities at the rate/manner it does is ultimately counterproductive. : what we're doing now is essentially letting them do whatever they want and then bailing them out, when i believe that they should be given a specific, tight budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies.","it increases the price, but not be nearly as much as you apparently think it is and not really a cyclical problem as you've suggested either. basic economic principles means that the government paying x for everyone's college would raise the price of college somewhere between 0 and x depending on the elasticity of supply and demand how consumers and providers choose to respond to price changes . the fact that the government doesn't offer financial aid to everyone is just going to make the price rise that much closer to the 0 end of things. but consumers as a whole will never be worse off if the government offers to pay for some college expenses. suppose widgets sell for 25 and the government comes along and offers everyone a free 10 if they buy a widget, so now it only costs people 15. suppose each person has an internal value for how much they are willing to buy a widget for. people who were willing to pay 25 were already buying widgets. people who aren't willing to pay even 15 will continue to not buy widgets. and anyone paynig between 15 25 will now buy widgets and claim the government money. the widget maker can respond to this in a number of ways. they could start producing more widgets to serve the people who are willing to pay 15 25. or they could raise their prices to up to 35 and get the whole 10 for themselves but get none of the benefit of additional sales. the only case in which they'd probably do the second one is if there is a strictly limited supply and making more just isn't really an option. why can't they raise the price above 35? well they would sell even less than they were originally and that isn't how sellers respond to things. as they make more money per sale they make more, not less. here is a more visual explanation of how the supply and demand curves respond to a subsidy like this one. unless the supply curve is vertical, meaning they just don't respond to changes in price by offering just as many spots no matter the price they can get and no new colleges opening up offering classes either when the price increases , then the consumer will also benefit from the subsidy. the overall price for consumers will be cheaper. but with a selective subsidy you can have some consumers hurt a little . the base price won't increase by as much as if everyone got the subsidy, but for anyone not getting the subsidy, they could end up paying a little more then before the subsidy.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'bailing them out'. if you mean that they should be given a specific budget that must be followed in order to receive subsidies, then you're basically saying that they shouldn't be given the specific budget.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to remember that the government is not the only entity that has the power to subsidize colleges and universities. it's not just the government that subsidizes colleges, it's the people who make the decisions that make those decisions. if the government were to give money to universities at the rate of manner, then it would be the people that would make the decision. if it was the government, then"

off by an overly interested woman in their first meeting while woman are more likely to be turned off by an overly interested man in their first meeting. this makes sense. woman are more likely to be victims of gendered violence and harassment and are pretty much told from a young age to be wary of overly interested men whom are strangers in this study . 2nd source: someone who is arrogant and manipulative, and willing to be so, is more likely to have more sex, volk's team found. well nah shit. people who manipulate people are going to be able to have more one night stands. you do realise the person being manipulated does not realise they are being manipulated. this invalidates your point completly. manipulates pretend to be great people. that is the point. they found that regardless of gender, teens with low humility honesty readings were more likely to bully and to use that bullying as a strategy to have more sex. so they manipulate and bully someone into sex or a relationship. so the victim here the person being bullied clearly isn t making a choice. this study completly invalidates your points. bad people manipulate pretend to be good people and bully partners into sex. 3rd source: however, bullying may be an effective behavior primarily for adolescents who possess personality traits that make them willing and able to use bullying as a strategy for obtaining sexual partners. same as the previous one. bad people either manipulate pretend to be nice or bully their partner into sex. this is not willing. this is not a choice. clearly if they have to manipulate or bully someone into sex then the partner isn t choosing based off bad traits they are either being forced or they believe the person has good traits. both these studies say there is no gender split. the same results occur with females and males. 4th source: this is an artical reporting on your 3rd source. are you reading your sources? are you just reading headlines? 5th source:link is broken for me. 6th source:this is another artical reporting on your 3rd and 4th source. please read your sources. why are you quoting sources and not reading them? 7th source: this is another artical about a study you have already quoted. this is an artical about your 1st source. 8th source:firstly, this is about short term relationship. it is about how men are able to manipulate read: pretend to have nice traits women for short term sex. narcissism and psychopathy are about short term charm and short term manipulation. this does not support your point at all. this shows that woman prefer nice traits. it shows that some men know woman prefer nice traits and use this to manipulate them. the traits of the prefered man are: the manipulation, exploitation, deceit and flattery of others; a lack of remorse, morality concerns and sensitivity, and cynicism. you do not realise when you are getting manipulated or exploitation. that is the point of them. you do not realised whem you are getting decited. that is the point. this study completly goes agaisnt what you say. the obvious conclusion is that to sleep with women men pretend to be nice guys. they pretend to have nice traits. woman fall for this. because they want nice traits. these men can only keep up the lie so long. after the lie and thus the nice traits stop the relationship stops as well. 9th source: i am going to put this in all caps because i do not understand why you have done this so many times. is it to inflate the number of sources you have so it seems more real? is it because you thought no one would read your sources? this is another source reporting on a source you have already posted. 10th source:this study admits itself that they do not think it is fully complete and they don t want to make conclusions. a key point of narcissism is manipulation. again, bad people pretending to be good people. 11th source: oh great. it starts off with a bloggers opinion. i m going to compeltly ignore the begining on some random person s opinions and skip to where they quote a study. i mean i m sure you won t mind since you didn t even read the sources. the study involves data extracted from the internet. great. no one lies on the internet for attention. no one pretends on the internet. and it was based on web searches, posts, and erotica. that is solid. none of that is exaggerated at all. i mean, when i look into what attracts men i just look up the most popular video on pornhub and conclude that is what all men are attracted to 100 of the time 100 of men. yep. oh, super. the data collected is so vaired that you could draw two completly different conclusions on it. by the way, ted bundy dod recieve letters from a large amount of women read: a couple hundred at most . he was a psychopath. he was manipulative. do we need to talk about what manipulative people do? they don t tell people they are manipulative. wanna know who recieve thousands and thousands and millions of letters and fans? boy bands. all of whom have an uptight, nice, gentleman like attitude. 12th source:1st, are you really really really legitmatly sourcing an anonymous blog post on incels. men who wish cancer on women, men who wish rape on women, men who degrade women and call them feminoids , men who expect sex. shouldn t they, according to you, be recieving sex? they are horribly degrading and disgusting people. shouldn t, according to you, women be falling head over heels for them? why aren t they? 2nd, i am not going to trust an ed out blog post of several studies. that is not a legitmate source. link the actual studies. oh look. look what we have here linked as a source. a source you have already linked stop repeating sources it does not make anything more legitmate. so in conclusion. you only have maybe 5 sources here of different studies. nearly all refute your point since it is about manipulation. the one that isn t about manipulation is about woman worrying about manipulation. do you have any sources that support the point you are making? if not, why do you believe your point despite there being no evidence?",i'm not sure what you mean by 'nice guy' or 'bad guy.'i think you're

the answer requires acceptance of the premises explained above that:1. this life is not all. 2. this life is the means to an end, which end is joy in the presence of god. 3. god provided a way that all that is unfair in this life can be made right in an eternal perspective. 4. the suffering we experience in this life intimately helps us to grow and progress this progression is essential in an eternal perspective. specifically, depending on which judeo christian religion you ask about children that die, you ll get different answers. here s the answer that makes sense to me given the above premises:children and innocents who suffer and die early in this life will have everything made right in the next life. babies that die go to heaven. in summary, you can reconcile the suffering that takes place in this world and the statement that god loves his children if you believe in the statements above. even if you don t believe in the statements, you can still accept that this is how those who do believe in god reconcile believing that he loves them with the suffering in the world.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to remember that god is not omnipotent, he's just a human being. he's not the only one who has the power to create the universe, but he's also the one who created the universe.","if you believe in a loving god, then you must also believe that there is a god who loves you. if you believe that god loves you, you must believe that he loves you as much as you love him."
 A total ban on guns won't work in the United States.,"the only reason we have mass shootings is because of people being screwed up in the head ie: parkland girl admitting to bullying the autistic foster kid, saying he deserved it and it's the guns fault that the school got shot up. i'm all for having 'mental health checks' on current gun owners, however if we are to do what the high school kiddos are suggesting and confiscate all 'fully semi semiautomatic high capacity 30 round clipazine assault rifle 15's' then things wouldn't be pretty."," A total ban on guns won't work in the United States. : the only reason we have mass shootings is because of people being screwed up in the head ie: parkland girl admitting to bullying the autistic foster kid, saying he deserved it and it's the guns fault that the school got shot up. i'm all for having 'mental health checks' on current gun owners, however if we are to do what the high school kiddos are suggesting and confiscate all 'fully semi semiautomatic high capacity 30 round clipazine assault rifle 15's' then things wouldn't be pretty.","when the second amendment was written, what guns do you think they had in mind? the vast majority of americans do not want a total ban, but a truer implementation of the original intention of the amendment.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i'm going to try to change your view. i'm not going to argue that guns are the cause of mass shootings, i'm just going to point out that there are a lot of reasons why mass shootings happen. firstly, mass shootings are not caused by guns, they are caused by people who are mentally ill. i don't think it's fair to say that mass shootings aren't caused by gun ownership, but","a total ban on guns won't work in the united states. there are a lot of things that can be done to reduce the number of guns in the country, but that doesn't mean that we won't have mass shootings. for example, if you want to ban guns, you need to ban all guns. if you don't, you can ban all handguns, but you can't ban all assault rifles."

" The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason.","a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident."," The Senate should be abolished because it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states, without a good reason. : a senate that is elected in this way thwarts the will of the people, instead we get minority rule, for instance, kavanaugh was just confirmed by senators that represent less than half of the us population. furthermore, i do think there is anything special about states to warrant allocating power in this way. the size and number of states is not based on some holy formula but is largely a product of historical accident.","although the eu is not a federation or structured in the same way as the united states, it s certainly reasonable to draw parallels. for the us, each state is partially sovereign, but also a part of the overall federation. they are granted representatives in two ways. one way is weighted based on the population of its member states. that s the house of representatives. the other is based on the virtue of being a state. prior to the creation of the the federal government, each state made a conscious agreement to join based on different contingencies. the more populated states have more of a voice in the federal government. but the less populated states would not have been incentivized to join if their voice was almost entirely drowned out by other states with larger populations. so they came up with the connecticut compromise to make an adjustment so that those less populated states had both representation based on population and the virtue of being a state. now, although again it s not a perfect parallel, 4 countries make up 50 of the population of the eu. if germany, france, uk, and italy had more similar interests than the other 24 and voted solely based on population, they could enact policies that harm the other 86 of member states. the us federal government is set up in a way where this won t happen. more populated states still get louder voices, but the representation of the states is corrected to a fair way that their membership was predicated on. more populous states have their representation corrected downwards, less populated states have their membership corrected upwards, but the rank order of the representation of all states still falls perfectly in line with their population. and they all agreed to this, again due to the weight of their population and the virtue of being a state. it would be entirely unfair to backtrack and revise the structure of representation without giving the delawares and wyomings and north dakotas the choice to leave the federation.","the problem with this system is that it is not representative of the majority of the population. it is representative of a large number of people, and it is very difficult to get a majority of people to vote for a president who represents a large portion of the country. the problem is that there are too many people who don't vote for the president, and there is no way to get them to vote in the first place.","i think the problem with the senate is that it gives more power to people in small states at the expense of people in big states. for example, if the dakotas and carolinas were both single states and california were six states, that we would have a dramatically different composition in the senate. however, this is not the case. it is the case that the majority of the senators in the united states are from small states, and the minority of senators in"

x200b; i'm pretty sure this makes sense, but if you disagree, then please, cmv.","you forgot to include the by your logic infinite number of gods that are willing to accept followers that follow the correct principles even if they don't know or follow any god. do good by your friends, family, and neighbors. if there are gods and they are just, then they will appreciate your good works. if there are gods and they are unjust, then they are not worth worshiping or following. if there are no gods, then you will be remembered favorably by those you encountered, and if there's no afterlife, then that's the best you can hope for.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i'm going to take a stab at it. first of all, i don't think it's logical to assume that there are only two possible gods. if there are no gods, then there's no reason to believe that there is no god. second, i think you're missing the point of the argument. if you believe in a god, then you have to accept that the probability of god exists. if god exists","i don't know if i can change your view, but i'm going to take a stab at it. i don't think it's logical to assume that there are only two possible gods, and that there is no reason to rule out any other number of possible gods. i think the problem with your argument is that it assumes that the existence of any god is unknowable. if you assume that god is not unknowable, then it's impossible to prove that god isn't unknow"
 Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control. Forgiving this shows lack of self respect.,"i noticed that cheating has been normalized especially with people of color poc in the media and in real life. it's sexist if you ask me. let me first define cheating. cheating is telling your partner you won't be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship, but still doing it. it's not considered cheating to me if it's an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot. also, when talking of relationships, i mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them. i don't want to hear of forced marriages, abusive relationships, or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what i'm thinking about. if the passion has died in your relationship, it is better to break off the relationship. i don't mean divorce though cause i know that involves money and can be messy, but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least. to me, if you cheat that means you don't love your so. if you really love your so and understand the pain it would cause them, you wouldn't consider cheating. if your so is having problems sexually and you cheat, that's basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared. there's also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue. and if it's that big of a deal and unsolvable, you can move on to an open relationship or seperate break up. people who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship and or the emotional support they felt in the relationship. i feel when people take back people who cheat, it's because they don't feel they'll ever find anyone to replace what they had which can be a valid point, but still sad desperate . imo i feel it's a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that. i feel this all makes perfect sense, but it's like the older i get the more people are acting like i'm living in fantasy land. beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women. great men are taking back women who cheat too. what's going on?"," Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control.

people consistently undervalue is that while cheating is a horrible thing to do to a person, it doesn't necessarily disregard the entire history that two people may have shared together. i've seen several older couples that find out one of the people cheated over decades. to be sure, once that knowledge is out, the relationship is forever changed. also note, that there was a huge discrepancy in the two people's understandings of what the relationship was to begin with. one person thought they were both being faithful, the other spent a significant amount of energy hiding some amount of their activities from their partner. once cheating becomes known, the relationship cannot be what it was, because it wasn't what it was claiming to be before that point anyway. to get back to why someone might forgive a cheater and it's ok: have you tried dating people? 90 of the people you will find in the dating pool are just not a good match for you, and a significant portion of those people are just not ready for a meaningful relationship to begin with. comparing that to a partner who cheated, in a simple pros cons format, will often place the cheater on the better side of the comparison, even with the huge 'cheated on me' con. the relationship likely had many positives before the cheating was known, and most of those positives haven't changed. ie: if the partner was worth staying with before the cheating and actively making the subjects life better, then once the cheating is known, they aren't making the subjects life as good as they once were, but it's still a net positive. going back to the older couples, sometimes it just isn't worth it to go back into the dating pool, you simply don't have enough time left in this world for it to be worth it. you might argue that is because they are showing less self respect, but i would argue that is merely accepting the facts of life. the world is what it is and you can do a simple math analysis on how many years it takes to get to a point of trust with a person. clearly, a cheater has ruined a significant amount of trust, especially physical intimacy, but relationships are about a lot more than that, and a truly sorry cheater can spend the rest of their years how many years is that anyway? making it up to their partner. not a very romantic solution, but definitely a situation that favors the forgiver. you mentioned the financial aspects of a relationship, and cheating actually has basically 0 impact on that. i once sat in a psychology class having to write an argument about the phrase 'those who marry for money get all that they deserve' and my only critique on the statement was 'why are the words 'for money' in that sentence? those who marry get all that they deserve, it doesn't matter what your reasons are, if you marry purely for love, you're just as big a fool' maybe the love is gone, maybe they aren't a really big fan of their partner personally, but the financial aspects of the marriage mean their whole life is fairly easy as long as they don't separate, or in some cases, initiate separation. this can, again, be a net positive. sometimes, people are just punishing themselves or whatever by keeping a cheater, but a lot of the time, it's not so much forgiving the cheater for cheating as much as acknowledging that life is just better by keeping them, even though it will never be as good as it might have seemed. that might sound depressing, but i've seen it in action. i've seen someone leave a cheater, only to come back 4 years later because things just weren't working out, and life with a cheater is better than what it was without the cheater. easy decision to make from that perspective. typo's and stuff, at this point i'm done.","i don't think it's sexist to take back someone who cheated on you, but it's not sexist to not take back people who cheat on you.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'cheating', but i think it's important to remember that cheating is not the same thing as cheating. it's not about cheating, it's about having sex with someone you love. if you're in a relationship with someone who you love, you're not going to cheat on them. you're going to have sex with them, and if you don't want to, you'll have to break up with them. i don't think"

society moving, that it s what fuels scientific innovation and all. however, it does not. rather it halts innovation, and we get stuck with shitty versions of technology that could be. for example, part of the cause of the great depression was that goods in the us were being made too well. they lasted too long without needing replacement, so eventually, business halted and people lost their jobs, as a result, goods have to be produced more shittily to keep business up. under capitalism, production requires financial incentive. when there s no financial incentive, things aren t made. then there s imperialism, which is the only logical extension of capitalism. growing capitalism needs more and more markets. it s a self destructive system that will always either fall to shit and be replaced or heavily modified with government safety nets, and when it withstands crumbling of being overthrown, it s maintained through military means or extreme human rights violations. if a society with the technology and infrastructure of somewhere like the us were to transition to a socialist society, education would be far more accessible, as would food and housing empty houses outnumber homeless people here and society would function more efficiently because everyone would have adequate food and shelter, at the very least. then more people would be able to pursue medicine or astronomy or engineering and better society instead of having to work late night retail shifts for years.","the problem with socialism is that it assumes that everyone has the same rights as everyone else. this is not the case. the problem is that there is no way for everyone to have equal rights. if everyone had equal rights, then everyone would have the same right to do what they want with their own money.","i'm not sure what you mean by'socialism' or 'capitalism' in the sense that you're talking about capitalism and socialism. i think you're confusing socialism with capitalism, which is a

 The word god shouldn't be used if you can't define it as a being,"words, as always, change in meaning over time, they morph and adapt as people choose to use them. this facet of language is often abused in discussions. this is a reason why it's helpful to banish ambiguous words so that they're forced to be swapped by the full intention behind them instead of the words themselves. however, i'm not of the opinion that we should rely on the dictionary as the tool closing the deal for what the definitions are. i don't have anything against ambiguity and fluidity of meanings however my point is that when two persons want to convey meaning to one another they have to be on the same ground. so here's my point: there's a surging trend these days of calling yourself a believer in god but not being able to qualify it and not accepting any attribute that others want to associate with it. the only attributes those people claim are not really valid in my opinion. for example: god is the starting point of the universe though not agreeing on if he has a mind or not, or any of its will, or any criteria for that matter god is the universe itself same as above, this doesn't tell us anything about it a sort of pantheism but that isn't with a mind or will. from my view i think this is highly confusing. i would call this atheism but those persons would still refer to themselves as theists or deists because they've chosen to keep using the word god. in some cases those persons even adhere to a religion or at least follow a certain set of ways of living, a system of values related to it. maybe this is vague and those persons just don't want to offend anyone. this seems like a weak position to me. is it still a guide of life? there used to be a time when we fought over the exact attributes that the gods of certain religions possessed, and before that deities were more anchored in reality even taking human forms as kings. is this a move from the personal religion to a new kind of religious transition? making peace between faith and rationality? deities being more vague than ever? however i'm open to changing my view if anyone is able to relate to situation in my post."," The word god shouldn't be used if you can't define it as a being : words, as always, change in meaning over time, they morph and adapt as people choose to use them. this facet of language is often abused in discussions. this is a reason why it's helpful to banish ambiguous words so that they're forced to be swapped by the full intention behind them instead of the words themselves. however, i'm not of the opinion that we should rely on the dictionary as the tool closing the deal for what the definitions are. i don't have anything against ambiguity and fluidity of meanings however my point is that when two persons want to convey meaning to one another they have to be on the same ground. so here's my point: there's a surging trend these days of calling yourself a believer in god but not being able to qualify it and not accepting any attribute that others want to associate with it. the only attributes those people claim are not really valid in my opinion. for example: god is the starting point of the universe though not agreeing on if he has a mind or not, or any of its will, or any criteria for that matter god is the universe itself same as above, this doesn't tell us anything about it a sort of pantheism but that isn't with a mind or will. from my view i think this is highly confusing. i would call this atheism but those persons would still refer to themselves as theists or deists because they've chosen to keep using the word god. in some cases those persons even adhere to a religion or at least follow a certain set of ways of living, a system of values related to it. maybe this is vague and those persons just don't want to offend anyone. this seems like a weak position to me. is it still a guide of life?

 Meaningful forgiveness can only be given upon request.,"i've heard many times that people should forgive those who wrong them in order to move on and be at peace. that doesn't seem right or useful to me. in such situations the wronged party essentially excuses their offender's behavior even when it doesn't necessarily deserve to be, and perpetuates that behavior. a good example might be a case where a person is raped is decides to forgive their attacker instead of seeking justice; the rapist is free to continue their attacks with their actions uncontested and without remorse. i'm no psychologist but it further seems like doing so may risk the victim's feeling of self worth deteriorating."," Meaningful forgiveness can only be given upon request. : i've heard many times that people should forgive those who wrong them in order to move on and be at peace. that doesn't seem right or useful to me. in such situations the wronged party essentially excuses their offender's behavior even when it doesn't necessarily deserve to be, and perpetuates that behavior. a good example might be a case where a person is raped is decides to forgive their attacker instead of seeking justice; the rapist is free to continue their attacks with their actions uncontested and without remorse. i'm no psychologist but it further seems like doing so may risk the victim's feeling of self worth deteriorating.","what if the perpetrator has only deeply apologized, without speaking the words 'please forgive me' or similar? what if the perpetrator has become incapable of asking for forgiveness? e. g. they're dying, in a coma, demented etc. ?","i don't think it's a good idea to forgive someone for something they didn't do. i think it is a good thing to forgive people for things they did wrong, but it's not the same thing as forgiving someone for things you did wrong.","i'm not sure what you mean by'meaningful forgiveness', but i think it's important to remember that forgiveness is not the only thing that can be given. for example, if a person is raped, it's not the fault of the rapist, but of the victim. if the rapist was raped, the victim would have been able to move on and be at peace. but if the victim was raped again, it would be the victim's fault, not the rapist's."

 The Term ‘LGBTQIA+’ is Actively Harmful Towards the Cause it Tries to Support Because it Drives Away Potential Supporters for Being...

" Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral","you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter? no matter how real it looks, it isn't . it may look uncomfortable to some people to see what looks like themselves in vulgar scenes, but just because something is uncomfortable to look at to some, does not mean it is inherently immoral. 2. you don't own the image of your face. every day you willingly give it away by walking in public or posting selfies of yourself online. this is especially true for celebrities. it's almost their job to make their appearance as widely known as possible. and even if you don't, you're not entitled to 'own' illustrations of yourself like a copyrighted piece of art anyway, at least not by default. it's human nature for people to remember how other people look and picture them in their heads, even in thoughts such as sexual fantasies. and if that's okay then i don't understand why it's not okay to just copy these thoughts into a tangible format such as an illustration. 3. technology is ever improving, and faked imagery is only going to get more realistic and easy to produce. i'm sure last century there were people equally offended by faked porn that would to our eyes look ridiculously bad and unrealistic. fakes are here to stay, and we need to adapt our sense of morality to reflect this reality. i believe this will happen and such images will get normalized sooner or later either way, but i think it would be in everyone's interest to just get it over with and make it sooner rather than later."," Fake porn such as ""deepfakes"" is not immoral : you've probably heard of the new 'deepfake' technique for swapping faces in video or images by now, and the fact that it is often used to creating fake porn of celebrities etc. but i don't really think so. i think it is perfectly fine to make and even publicly post such media. i guess the reasons why i think so can be summed into three main points: 1. it's not real. it's fiction. it doesn't represent an actual event. there isn't really any meaningful difference between this and a bad photoshop, or a caricature drawing, or even fanfiction text. it just looks more real, but why does that really matter? no matter how real it looks, it isn't . it may look uncomfortable to some people to see what looks like themselves in vulgar scenes, but just because something is uncomfortable to look at to some, does not mean it is inherently immoral. 2. you don't own the image of your face. every day you willingly give it away by walking in public or posting selfies of yourself online. this is especially true for celebrities. it's almost their job to make their appearance as widely known as possible. and even if you don't, you're not entitled to 'own' illustrations of yourself like a copyrighted piece of art anyway, at least not by default. it's human nature for people to remember how other people look and picture them in their heads, even in thoughts such as sexual fantasies. and if that's okay then i don't understand why it's not okay to just copy these thoughts into a tangible format such as an illustration. 3. technology is ever improving, and faked imagery is only going to get more realistic and easy to produce. i'm sure last century there were people equally offended by faked porn that would to our eyes look ridiculously bad and unrealistic. fakes are here to stay, and we need to adapt our sense of morality to reflect this reality. i believe this will happen and such images will get normalized sooner or later either way, but i think it would be in everyone's interest to just get it over with and make it sooner rather than later.","how do you define morality? i think doing something deeply hurtful to another human being is immoral. if someone put my face on a porn star in a video, i'd feel horribly violated and humiliated, as would most women i imagine. how is it just fiction when you're using a real person's face? it's awful.",i don't think it's immoral to make and even publicly post such media. i think it is immoral to just get it over with and make it sooner rather than later.,"it's not immoral to make and even publicly post such media. it's immoral to just copy these thoughts into a tangible format such as an illustration. if you don't own the image of your face, you're not entitled to 'own it.

 4chan’s algorithm for discussion threads is superior to Reddit’s.,"the more people comment on a post, the longer it stays on the front page. i think this is preferable to the upvote downvote system because that means the most contentious and engaged topics are what is seen. too many interesting posts on reddit go unnoticed due to rigorous downvoting. sometimes a publication like national review can put out a very interesting article but it will never be seen on r politics due to the left slant of most of its user base and the barrage of downvotes such a post would receive. if such a post were instead ranked based on interaction rather than voting, i think you d see a more diverse range of topics. i don t want to single out r politics but it s the easiest sub that comes to mind. it d be nice if the material that is visible was ranked on how much discussion it creates rather than how much it pleases the crowd. this way a few downvotes early on cannot bury a post, the only thing that can do that is being so uninteresting that nobody bothers to comment on it."," 4chan’s algorithm for discussion threads is superior to Reddit’s. : the more people comment on a post, the longer it stays on the front page. i think this is preferable to the upvote downvote system because that means the most contentious and engaged topics are what is seen. too many interesting posts on reddit go unnoticed due to rigorous downvoting. sometimes a publication like national review can put out a very interesting article but it will never be seen on r politics due to the left slant of most of its user base and the barrage of downvotes such a post would receive. if such a post were instead ranked based on interaction rather than voting, i think you d see a more diverse range of topics. i don t want to single out r politics but it s the easiest sub that comes to mind. it d be nice if the material that is visible was ranked on how much discussion it creates rather than how much it pleases the crowd. this way a few downvotes early on cannot bury a post, the only thing that can do that is being so uninteresting that nobody bothers to comment on it.","i contest that we have an algorithm on 4chan. there is no algorithm, just a mass of assholes. which include me.","i agree with you, but i don't think it's a good idea to rank posts based on how many downvotes they get. i think it would be better to rank them based on the number of downvotes, rather than the quality of the post itself. if you want to rank a post based on quality, you need to rank it based on its quality.","i don't think 4chan's algorithm is superior to reddit's, but i think it's a good idea to look at it from a different angle. if you look at the top of r politics, you'll see that there's a lot of discussion going on, but it's not always the most interesting topic. i think you're missing the point of reddit's algorithm, which is to make it easier for people to find interesting topics to discuss. i don't know if you"

 Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords.,"by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name? ' , then that is almost certainly easier to guess than it would be to guess their password. the overall security is reduced. instead of forcing password restrictions, users should have the freedom to choose a password as 'strong' or as 'weak' as they wish. inform the users when they are making their account how strong their passwords are, and give recommendations. but at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion. cmv!"," Websites should not have mandatory limitations on passwords. : by forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters. by forcing a password to contain numbers and or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and or special characters. most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. they replace certain letters with numbers sp chars, or they add the numbers sp chars to the end. when passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. as someone who has worked in it, i can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. people write down passwords when they can't remember them. it makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as 'letmein'. when users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. this reduces overall security, because if any of those things i just mentioned are hacked, then a 'hacker' can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password. for example, if i can see that their account recovery question is 'what was my mother's maiden name?

 To believe in a loving God requires a certain level of delusional thinking or ignorance to how the world works.,"i'm genuinely interested in a rational explanation for the problems i have with this idea as i've never gotten one, most people just shut down or get angry when i ask it. not some backwards version we can say god has. 5 million children die a year. even if we removed the number of children that died at the hands of another human, the number would still be massive. how does that sound like love? how does a child randomly getting cancer sound like love, in our context as humans? i could go on, but i feel this is a good jumping off point. thanks for posts in advance! this assumes the god is also omnipotent and omnipresent. 2: i'm making my way to every comment, i address shorter ones first to try and make it easier on myself. 3: i'm sorely disappointed in the lack of butts i have in my inbox, shame on you cmv readers. alright, sorry, enough joking and back to commenting. 4: i'm getting a good number of replies saying that i'm stubborn or aren't open to changing my view, i completely understand where this is coming from. please understand this is a complex issue and there is a lot of material i have to work through, bare with me. i'm inclined to keep asking questions so everyone understands each other better. also, and i know this may seem more controversial, if someone ends up not changing their mind in this sub reddit can we all still agree educating and having a civil discussion is still beneficial? i've see comments i think are trying to undermine my belief in this because some points made aren't adequate for me but are for someone else. thank you to everyone so far. this continues to be a productive thread, in my mind."," To believe in a loving God requires a certain level of delusional thinking or ignorance to how the world works. : i'm genuinely interested in a rational explanation for the problems i have with this idea as i've never gotten one, most people just shut down or get angry when i ask it. not some backwards version we can say god has. 5 million children die a year. even if we removed the number of children that died at the hands of another human, the number would still be massive. how does that sound like love? how does a child randomly getting cancer sound like love, in our context as humans? i could go on, but i feel this is a good jumping off point. thanks for posts in advance! this assumes the god is also omnipotent and omnipresent. 2: i'm making my way to every comment, i address shorter ones first to try and make it easier on myself. 3: i'm sorely disappointed in the lack of butts i have in my inbox, shame on you cmv readers. alright, sorry, enough joking and back to commenting. 4: i'm getting a good number of replies saying that i'm stubborn or aren't open to changing my view, i completely understand where this is coming from. please understand this is a complex issue and there is a lot of material i have to work through, bare with me. i'm inclined to keep asking questions so everyone understands each other better. also, and i know this may seem more controversial, if someone ends up not changing their mind in this sub reddit can we all still agree educating and having a civil discussion is still beneficial? i've see comments i think are trying to undermine my belief in this because some points made aren't adequate for me but are for someone else. thank you to everyone so far. this continues to be a productive thread, in my mind.","i tried to understand too, the movie the shack helped me see their side.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to remember that god is not omnipotent, he's just a human being. he's not the only one who has the power to create the universe, but he's also the one who created the universe.","if you believe in a loving god, then you must also believe that there is a god who loves you. if you believe that god loves you, you must believe that he loves you as much as you love him."
" the story of Job teaches no valuable lessons, other than God is a jerk.","by this i mean that the book doesn't contain any notable insights nor does it resolve any interesting theological questions, albeit i personally love it as a piece of absurdist fiction. worse than that, it seems to be undermining the very religion of whose holy text it belongs to. the book revolves a lot about theodicy; the problem of evil in the world. how can bad things happen to good people, and vice versa? the closest thing the book gives to an answer, is that we puny mortals can't grasp it. the israelites are taught time and again, that the reason they're getting slaughtered by fillistines or robbed and exiled is because they have turned away from god and sinned. they are led to believe, convinced by prophets send by god, that their actions have consequences corresponding to their sins. obviously when job suddenly gets hit by outrageous misfortune, his friends believe him to have committed some secret sin to cause it. we know however, that no such cause exists, and that god just wanted to prove a point to a buddy. god even scolds the friends for assuming that jobs misfortunes were caused by sin, like they have been repeatedly taught by him. all through the bible people are explicitly being punished or provided for according to their sins. by punishing job he is undermining the coherency of his followers, by denying them the belief that has kept them together through suffering and exile; that their suffering isn't pointless, and that it's all just and right. even if job gets richer in the end, how about his original sons and daughters who died horrible deaths for no reason? in the book satan raises the question of the possibility of selfless righteousness. some people are righteous whilst reaping no benefit whatsoever. the problem of unpunished evil goes completely unanswered. also, whether job even remains faithful is, in my opinion, up to debate. is it faith to maintain that god is injust and unfair?

 I believe that it is both a waste of resources and unjustifiably selfish to have children in these times. I would go so far as to say it’s immoral.,"i got into an argument with someone over my opinion today, and they weren t able to articulate a convincing counter argument so i m wondering if one of you might be able to. my thinking is thus: we are living in an era of upheaval and political unrest all around the globe. we are just beginning to feel the effects of global warming and climate change, and in the years to come the effects will become even more dramatic. the planet is overpopulated. and it s been estimated that there are 153 million orphans around the world who need homes. if you simply must have a child, adopt one of the many who need a family. with all that said, what incentive is there for having a biological child? some people want to have a child that shares their dna, that looks like them, that will continue their lineage. and i m sorry, but in my book that s just plain old fashioned selfishness. why do you think you re so special? it s that kind of limited, self centered thinking that has gotten us to a crisis point as a planet. once all the orphans in the world have been adopted, and we ve turned back the clock on global warming and overpopulation, then maybe it ll be acceptable to procreate again. there was a point in human history where we needed to procreate so that the species would survive. now the opposite seems to be true we need to not procreate if we want to survive. i realize this is a very emotional subject for a lot of people. but really, why would you do that when you could adopt a child in need? for the sake of our planet and our species. can someone can come up with a different argument, that can withstand the scrutiny of logic?"," I believe that it is both a waste of resources and unjustifiably selfish to have children in these times.

 I'm Pro-choice.,"first of all sorry for the abortion topic, this is a view that has been beaten to death. i hate read lot of conservative sites like townhall or fedaralist and there is an anti abortion piece in the site almost everyday. it's almost like propaganda to me at this point. yet clear and convincing arguments for abortion is never presented. my anecdotal view of abortion is, if i were to get a genetic kidney disorder i cannot use the government to force my parents to give me their kidneys. without that kidney i would die but that is not the same as my parents killing me. same way a women should not be forced to bear a fetus that is parasitic to her body. without the mothers support the fetus would die but that is not the same as her killing it. until a fetus achieve viability outside the womb a women retains the right to on demand abortion. afterwards restrictions should be put in place like a threat to the mothers health. denying the right to a women her bodily autonomy i believe is a slippery slope. a pregnant women whose food , medication, smoking, alcohol that is harmful to the fetus can be construed as child abuse and pave the road for criminal legislation. i wrote this on my phone so there might be some grammatical errors. cmv"," I'm Pro-choice. : first of all sorry for the abortion topic, this is a view that has been beaten to death. i hate read lot of conservative sites like townhall or fedaralist and there is an anti abortion piece in the site almost everyday. it's almost like propaganda to me at this point. yet clear and convincing arguments for abortion is never presented. my anecdotal view of abortion is, if i were to get a genetic kidney disorder i cannot use the government to force my parents to give me their kidneys. without that kidney i would die but that is not the same as my parents killing me. same way a women should not be forced to bear a fetus that is parasitic to her body. without the mothers support the fetus would die but that is not the same as her killing it. until a fetus achieve viability outside the womb a women retains the right to on demand abortion. afterwards restrictions should be put in place like a threat to the mothers health. denying the right to a women her bodily autonomy i believe is a slippery slope. a pregnant women whose food , medication, smoking, alcohol that is harmful to the fetus can be construed as child abuse and pave the road for criminal legislation. i wrote this on my phone so there might be some grammatical errors. cmv","fetuses don't achieve viability outside of the womb even after they are born. humans specifically baby humans are really weak on their own. they need at least one adult to care for them. so should we be able to neglect fetuses after they are born too? most people don't think so. most people consider it wrong to leave a baby in a trash can. the argument against this, that i can imagine, is that someone else can take care of the child after it is born after roughly 6 months of pregnancy. however, why is there a compelling interest to taking care of the child? most people don't want to adopt. why don't we just leave the orphans on the street to fend for themselves? overall, you always have a choice for everything. if i decide to cheat on my wife, that is my choice. if i decide to speed, it's my choice. if i decide to kill someone, that's my choice. the main argument is, is the fetus human alive, is killing something that is human alive wrong? personally i'm fine with killing things. i eat meat, i'm fine with kill shelters, with animal testing etc. however, i value human life. there is a religious reason i have for valuing human life. i believe that humans are made in god's image and that other animals are given to us, with our dominion over them. we shouldn't kill animals recklessly because we have dominion, but it is amoral whether or not an animal dies. however, i think it is moral whether or not a human is killed or not. if you are not religious, then according to the atheistic logic that makes sense to me, you get to define what is right and wrong. so you decide if human lives are moral or not, whether animal lives are moral or not, whether plant lives are moral or not. if you aren't deciding for yourself, then you are deciding from a relativist cultural standpoint i'm assuming you aren't, but i'll cover it just in case . if this is the case, then it is legally acceptable in america and it is something that is hidden. don't ask, don't tell. you only risk cultural shame by mentioning it which is why i'm assuming you aren't talking about relativism .","i don't think it's a slippery slope, but i think you're missing the point. a fetus is a human being. it is not a person, it is a person. a person has the right to decide what happens to their body. if a woman wants to have an abortion, she should be able to do so. if she doesn't want to, she shouldn't be forced to do it. if you want to have a child, you should be allowed to do","i'm pro choice, but i don't think it's a slippery slope. i'm pro life because i believe that a fetus is a human being, and that it should have the right to be born. i think that a woman should be able to choose what she wants to do with her body, but that's not the same as a woman being forced to carry a fetus to term. if a woman wants to have an abortion, she should be allowed to do so. if"

' incel before 'incel' was really a buzzword. like an incel, he was lonely. like an incel, he felt 'entitled' to a woman. like an incel, he saw fit to punish that woman for being with someone else, even though that woman didn't know he existed. and like an incel, he was very depressed and unhappy with life in general. and like many incels, he eventually ended up killing himself. and what happened? he wasn't seen as some piece of shit like minassian was. bj rk even mourned his passing. because she and many others understood that what he was doing was not acceptable, but his mind was too far gone for him to just stop doing it. amp; x200b; and it wasn't just cho or lopez or aghdam or the columbine kids. there's stack, there's huberty, there's a whole long list of them, who commit extreme unjustified acts, but somehow we're able to see the tortured existence inside. not being able to date bj rk is no reason to actively try and mutilate her. just like not having had sex is no reason to call for the enslavement of all women. but for lopez we understand that while his reasons are unjustified, something's wrong in his head that turns his loneliness into a reason to kill. so why can't we see that in minassian, or rodger, or the many other incels out there? and in aghdam's case, only just slightly before. how did our attitude towards mental health change so drastically between aghdam and minassian?","when you say 'mental health issues,' are you thinking of any specific disorders? unless you name some depression, schizophrenia, etc or give some guidelines for what counts as mentally ill e. g. obsessing over something to the point that it causes self harm , i think calling someone 'mentally ill' is subjective and can't be debated very well. for example, some extremely religious people think that atheists are mentally ill but that's not a view that most other people would agree with. simply googling 'what is mentally ill' showed me a lot of debate on the topic. here's one of the article","i don't think it's fair to say that incels are selfish assholes, but i think it is fair to assume that they are not. i don't know if you've ever met an incel, but it seems to me that you've never met a person who is a violent misogynist. i'm not sure what you mean by that.",i don't think it's fair to say that incels aren't violent misogynists. i think it is fair to assume that they are.

 CEO salaries should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker,"this provides a powerful incentive to a ceo to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. the downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low skill workers, with ceos making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage."," CEO salaries should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker : this provides a powerful incentive to a ceo to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. the downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low skill workers, with ceos making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage.","first of all, such a thing will immediately result in companies contracting out all the low paying duties. the ceo of a tech company is not going to be held back because the company employs one minimum wage parking lot attendant. hr will be contracted out too. only the employees driving the core revenue of the corporation would remain. now after all the support jobs are contracted out, let's look at two companies. one is the company that was contracted for the low end services of the first company. it's a big company contracting these services to lots of others. say it has 50,000 employees. you have a ceo managing a 50,000 person company and his salary is based on minimum wage. now let's look to that engineering company that contracted out its support jobs. all that's left is a few hundred engineers and managers, and the lowest paid person there makes 60,000 a year. this ceo of a small company is allowed to make over twice the salary of the ceo of the huge company. does that make sense? , finish this off. so now you're a talented ceo type and are looking for a job. you look at these two companies, and of course you're going to go for the engineering company since you can make more money. this will be happening across the nation, so in the end the most talented ceos will be running the high paid companies, and the companies employing most of the minimum wage workers will be run by the less talented ceos. do you think that is a good situation?",i don't think it's fair to say that a ceo making 1000x minimum wage will increase the value of their company as it'll improve their stock value.,"i agree with you that ceo salaries should be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers, but i don't think it's fair to tie them to the salaries of their highest paid workers."

don't need to work, negates a number of downsides. you don't have to put up with crap, you can pick the work that seems most interesting, and if a job goes south, you can bail. if you want, you can

 People who take a hard-line stance against illegal immigration in America are cold and heartless human beings,"yes. i'm going there. they are coming here because they don't want to be murdered and raped. because they want their kids to actually have a future. they are living lives in mexico that we cannot even imagine as american citizens. this can't have anything to do with increased crime because illegals don't commit more crime than native citizens. they commit less. and this can't have anything to do with 'taking our jobs' because they work jobs that native citizens would seriously not want to do, not to mention that the immigrant workforce is actually positive for the american economy. so then, what is it? the law? given what we know about the situation as a whole, my stance on the whole law side of things can be summed up in just 3 words: fuck the law. we are entirely in control of what our laws say and how we choose to enforce them. the law should not be our starting point. doing what's right is our starting point, and our laws flow from there. the difficulty of changing the laws is a shitty excuse to stay beholden to them, especially when we are talking about a humanitarian crisis. i triple dog dare you. cmv."," People who take a hard-line stance against illegal immigration in America are cold and heartless human beings : yes. i'm going there. they are coming here because they don't want to be murdered and raped. because they want their kids to actually have a future. they are living lives in mexico that we cannot even imagine as american citizens. this can't have anything to do with increased crime because illegals don't commit more crime than native citizens. they commit less. and this can't have anything to do with 'taking our jobs' because they work jobs that native citizens would seriously not want to do, not to mention that the immigrant workforce is actually positive for the american economy. so then, what is it? the law? given what we know about the situation as a whole, my stance on the whole law side of things can be summed up in just 3 words: fuck the law. we are entirely in control of what our laws say and how we choose to enforce them. the law should not be our starting point. doing what's right is our starting point, and our laws flow from there. the difficulty of changing the laws is a shitty excuse to stay beholden to them, especially when we are talking about a humanitarian crisis. i triple dog dare you. cmv.",an argument to consider is that illegal immigrants take away opportunity from immigrants who want to immigrate legally. why should mexican and other latin americans get a priority to get into usa over people who live in philippines or central african republic just because their country is geographically closer?,"i don't think it's fair to say that illegal immigration is a good thing, but it's also a bad thing. it's not like you're saying that illegals should be allowed to come here because they want their kids to actually have a future, it's just that they don't want to live in the us.","i don't think it's cold and heartless to take a hard line stance against illegal immigration in america, but i think it is a good thing to be a christian."

 Private companies / Religious organizations should have the right to 'discriminate' based on sexual orientation or gender identity.,"there are several reasons why i hold this view, but for now, i will only describe one. i am a big fan of free speech, i think free speech is essential and that everyone should be allowed to say whatever they think, no matter how controversial or even mistaken they are. government should not ban hate speech, because in my opinion hate speech is in fact free speech which some people groups do not like. however, i think that if you are intellectually consistent, that would also mean that a gay person should be forced to make a cake which is against his beliefs convictions. a cake on which says 'all gays will burn in hell forever'."," Private companies / Religious organizations should have the right to 'discriminate' based on sexual orientation or gender identity. : there are several reasons why i hold this view, but for now, i will only describe one. i am a big fan of free speech, i think free speech is essential and that everyone should be allowed to say whatever they think, no matter how controversial or even mistaken they are. government should not ban hate speech, because in my opinion hate speech is in fact free speech which some people groups do not like. however, i think that if you are intellectually consistent, that would also mean that a gay person should be forced to make a cake which is against his beliefs convictions. a cake on which says 'all gays will burn in hell forever'.","throughout this discussion it seems like free speech is weirdly axiomatic to you. free speech should be defended for free speeches sake. this is a baffling assumption that you haven t justified anywhere. if it is, indeed, axiomatic, then how do you propose anyone change your mind ? my particular view is that free speech is important to the degree that it makes individual s lives better on average. if preventing everyone s ability to say fart somehow dramatically improved worldwide quality of life, i would be totally on board. free speech is important because it helps you fight against personal unfairness. hate speech and discrimination both diminish the speech of the people being discriminated against and therefore lower overall well being. why should they be defended ?","i'm not sure what you mean by 'freedom of speech'. if you mean the right to free speech, then i think you're confusing freedom of speech with freedom of religion. if you're saying 'all gays will burn in hell forever', then i don't see how you can argue against that.","i think that private companies should have the right to 'discriminate' based on sexual orientation or gender identity. i don't think that government should ban hate speech, but i do think that it should be allowed to discriminate based on race, religion, etc."
 I don't see how morality can be objective,"it's abstract. unless you believe rational thoughts can appear without any humans present, it's subjective. the reason things like trees are objective is because if you were to kill every human, the tree would still be there. but you can't say the same for something that exists in head. so yeah, that's my argument. i'd prefer no theological attempts at changing my view god exists and his morals are objective because that'd completely shift the focus of the discussion, and i'm an apatheist."," I don't see how morality can be objective : it's abstract. unless you believe rational thoughts can appear without any humans present, it's subjective. the reason things like trees are objective is because if you were to kill every human, the tree would still be there. but you can't say the same for something that exists in head. so yeah, that's my argument. i'd prefer no theological attempts at changing my view god exists and his morals are objective because that'd completely shift the focus of the discussion, and i'm an apatheist.","i generally believe that morality is subjective for the most part, but i think it is possible to construct a non theological framework for objective morality. tell me if you disagree with my definition of morality, but i'm going to use one of the first ones i found with a quick search: a system of ideas of right and wrong conductthe first step is to decide on some goals, some purpose for having morality. this step is a bit subjective, but i think theoretically you could come up with a few baseline points that a large amount of people could agree with for example, we want a system of morality that minimizes suffering, while maximizing enjoyment and quality of life. all of those terms might have to be defined a bit better, but lets imagine we sit down with a bunch of people and decide on some metrics that we can agree on to determine quality of life, suffering, etc. at this point, i think i can believe that there is some objectively optimal morality that we could choose to adopt, which if we all followed would fit the criteria layed out in the previous step. without a god to deliver that morality to us, we might not ever discover it, and even less likely that everyone would choose to follow it, but it probably exists, independent of whether we know about it or not.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'objective'. if you mean objective, then i think that's a bit of a stretch to say that it's objective, but i think you're missing the point. if you define objective as something that exists in your head, then you can't say the same for things that exist in head, because that's not what you're talking about.","i don't see how morality can be objective. it's a thought, it's an ideal, and it's abstract. if you believe rational thoughts can appear without any humans present, then it's objective. you can't say the same for something that exists in head, because if you were to kill every human, the tree would still be there."

 James Cameron's Avatar is Underrated,"but by now the circlejerk about 'pocahontas in space' or 'fern gully in space' or 'dances with wolves in space' have come so far that i feel that this movie has gone around to being pretty dang underrated. let's knock that first big criticism right off the bat: yes. the plot is derivative. but to be honest, there are a lot of derivative movies out there, so i don't think that's as huge a knock against the movie as other people do. and honestly, the plot structure makes a lot of sense: you have a big crazy world you've developed, what's the best way to get the audience to appreciate it? take an audience proxy character and put them through a protracted fish out of water narrative. now on to the movie's good points firstly, it's one of the only movies, and especially one of the only not completely animated movies, to get a really really good result out of 3d. i've seen the movie 4 times since it came out in 2009: twice in theaters, and twice seeing the extended cut at home protip: the extended cut really does improve the plot quite a bit . and if it came back into theaters in 3d, i would watch the hell out of it in that format, and i'm not normally one to shell out extra for movies in 3d secondly, the movie is technically and visually very well executed outside of 3d: the creatures are all interesting and cool; the ecosystem is dramatic and visually stimulating, mixing tropical rainforest, influences from undersea structures, and karst style rock formations; the near future style human technology is all interesting and gives a good sense of purpose and feels used and lived in. the opening interstellar spaceship did the really cool semi plausible long distance spaceship design that the martian did, but years before that film. and to be honest, the cast is pretty excellent, especially in the roles they're given. stephen lang is awesome as a villainous version of r. lee ermey rip gunny . michelle rodriguez continues to do michelle rodriguez things, which imho is never bad, though it's always a little bit campy. sigourney weaver is good. sam worthington and zoe saldana are both pretty decent as well. so yeah, i think the 'derivative plot' circlejerk has gotten so strong that people ignore the good things about a movie that did a few things wrong and a lot of things right. i don't think it's a 10 10 movie, but it's a solid and entertaining film that stands up to rewatching."," James Cameron's Avatar is Underrated : but by now the circlejerk about 'pocahontas in space' or 'fern gully in space' or 'dances with wolves in space' have come so far that i feel that this movie has gone around to being pretty dang underrated. let's knock that first big criticism right off the bat: yes. the plot is derivative. but to be honest, there are a lot of derivative movies out there, so i don't think that's as huge a knock against the movie as other people do. and honestly, the plot structure makes a lot of sense: you have a big crazy world you've developed, what's the best way to get the audience to appreciate it?

 Contemporary Feminism is sexist,ok so first of i think of everyone as equal and i don't think any race or gender is better then the rest. it's sexist for both men and woman actually. so they get stuff handed to them. a small example of this is a female adaptation for every movie. if hollywood was truely feminist they would make their own movie with a female lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie. now on the male end of this. so a man can't make a valid point without being called priveleged white scum or what have you. yes i know all men aren't white but you see my point. i truely think it's coming from a good place. however they need to become more self aware and realize they are who they hate. so yeah that's it. change my view, Contemporary Feminism is sexist : ok so first of i think of everyone as equal and i don't think any race or gender is better then the rest. it's sexist for both men and woman actually. so they get stuff handed to them. a small example of this is a female adaptation for every movie. if hollywood was truely feminist they would make their own movie with a female lead that is both empowering to woman and actually a good movie. now on the male end of this. so a man can't make a valid point without being called priveleged white scum or what have you. yes i know all men aren't white but you see my point. i truely think it's coming from a good place. however they need to become more self aware and realize they are who they hate. so yeah that's it. change my view,"the best way that i ve been able to describe modern feminism is with the analogy of a race. normally, everyone begins at the same starting block, and when the gun goes off, everyone goes on a runnin. however, due to inequality, there are very few races in the world that have everyone on equal footing, if they could even be let in to start the race in the first place. in short, some racers don t even get to start at the start. in this specific case, we ll focus on women. the first wave of feminism brought western women up toward the starting line a whole bunch! the right to vote, divorce, etc, moved women s rights forward and gave them more of a fighting chance at equity. however, they still were not starting as far forward as men. next game advancements in attitudes toward female sexuality and reproductive freedom, equality in the workplace, each step bringing women a bit closer to the starting line. however, we are still not there. now, let s tackle modern examples that you ve given, like female representation in the media. this is, to some including me , a comparatively small step forward when it comes to getting to the starting line. however, it is still a step forward. think about it from the prospective of women in this race we see ourselves pushing closer and closer to the starting line, more and more toward equity. some people may see this, however, as their chance at the proverbial first place being threatened. technically, yeah. the more people there are in the game, the more likely someone else will win out. however, this is where i like to make things a bit bigger picture. yes, human nature is self preservation. we want the best for ourselves, and this is not always a bad instinct. however, it s entirely possible to want the best for yourself and want the best for others as well. that is why feminism has also fought to ensure that male rape victims are treated fairly in society and in law, that fathers have an equal chance in custody cases if they choose to pursue it, that men do not suffer from the same generalisations and stereotypes that harm women. i will not deny that every movement has its fringes that must be challenged when they make harmful statements, generalisations, and accusations. feminism is no different. however, it still holds the equity of sexes at its heart, and that means getting everyone to the same starting line. cassini.",i don't think it's a good idea to make a movie with a female lead because it's sexist for both men and women actually. i think it is a bad idea to have a movie that is sexist because it is sexist.,"feminism isn't sexist, it's just that it doesn't have a clear definition of what it means to be a feminist. i'm not sure what you mean by 'feminism', but i think it's important to note that the term 'feminist' is not meant to mean 'feminine' or 'anti feminist'. it's meant to refer to a group of people who believe in equality for all, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or sexual orientation."

 Star Wars the Last Jedi is bad except for in visuals.,"warning: this post will contain spoilers for tlj. if you hadn t watched it and don t want it be spoiled, then click off this post now. you have been warned now, i am of the camp, who, gasp, wasn t a big fan of tlj. now unlike most people i can see some good in it, and i think that those few good points are what makes up the positive camp. so this why tlj is not good. 1. that has to do with the character rey. rey is a mary sue sue . she is great at everything she tries. she s an amazing pilot, mechanic, gunslinger, jedi, force user, who can stand toe to toe and even beat much more experienced jedi and sith lords. now, in fa, i was able to ignore it more due to the fact that i thought that it would be revealed in lj, that she was connected to someone or something important. in tlj, it s decided that her backstory, that thing teased about by jj abrams and his mystery box, is unimportant. she s just the child of some drunk hobos. she s a no one. this infuriates me. there is no reason this character should be this powerful without any training. it took luke months before he became a tenth as powerful as her. ben spent all of his life training with a jedi legend, easily defeated by a girl who didn t think the force was real just a few days ago. it also doesn t help that rey expresses less that the lovechild of bella swan and jimmy stewart. i mean, does she even smile in this movie. at all. 2. another hole in wall do even have to state this. superman leia are so many plot holes in this movie. so. instead of talking about them in long ranting detail, i will just create a list. 1. how did the order get everyone together. 2. where did they get the resources to fund them. 3. why didn t holdor tell them about the plan. she risked a mutiny because she didn t tell them about it. 4. how did the hacker know that they were using escape pods. 5. how do spaceships run out of fuel. this is the first time we ve heard about this risk. 6. why didn t the fuel up earlier. 7. how do bombs fall in 0 gravity. 8. why did ben kill his master. wasn t the point of killing his dad to prove his loyalty to him. 9. why would luke create a map to him if he wanted to be left alone. 10. if lightspeed could destroy a ship like that, why didn t one x wing flying into the death star in iv and cut it in half. 11. when did luke get the jedi texts. 12. how did luke die? 13. how can leia fly through space! ? ! 3. clutter my third big problem with the movie was that it felt cluttered. new important characters have been introduced into the movie that we have never heard of and for the most part didn t care about. rose: token asian who adds nothing to the plot. she only exists to be the token. holdor: she could ve should ve been replaced by admiral akbar and the movie would have been better for it. dj: hacker who could have been interesting had he been given more time on screen. only character you will actually even passingly care about. now. many might argue that i am being heavily judgmental. here is my proof that these characters suck. quote one line they said. any line. this movie is also very cluttered, despite being near 2 hours and thirty minutes. this is mostly due to the casino plot point. it was mostly a drag and a bore. they spend multiple minutes talking about how capitalism is evil. in my opinion, instead of the c plot, we could should have seen a rise of factionalism rise in the resistance. with no cleat leader, many pretenders, and faction groups rise. some thinking they should flee and regroup later. and others saying that they should stay the course. that would have been much more interesting than the bland casino scene. 4. deus ex machina and a lavk of this is my 4th and last problem with it. that and they fail to answer the real questions we have. why can leia fly? she just can. she s just chosen. how does rey learn the force so quickly? cuz movie. how do they know the rebels are escaping in the pods. cuz movie. questions we wanted answered. who s snoke? who cares. who re rey s parents? i dunno, junkies? how did fin join the stormtroopers? who cares! how does luke use to force to project himself? who cares. who were the knights of rin? who cares. in summary the biggest problem is that the movie fails to give us satisfying answers to the biggest questions and fails to create compelling stories or characters. so, cmv that tlj is bad."," Star Wars the Last Jedi is bad except for in visuals. : warning: this post will contain spoilers for tlj. if you hadn t watched it and don t want it be spoiled, then click off this post now. you have been warned now, i am of the camp, who, gasp, wasn t a big fan of tlj. now unlike most people i can see some good in it, and i think that those few good points are what makes up the positive camp. so this why tlj is not good. 1. that has to do with the character rey. rey is a mary sue sue . she is great at everything she tries. she s an amazing pilot, mechanic, gunslinger, jedi, force user, who can stand toe to toe and even beat much more experienced jedi and sith lords. now, in fa, i was able to ignore it more due to the fact that i thought that it would be revealed in lj, that she was connected to someone or something important. in tlj, it s decided that her backstory, that thing teased about by jj abrams and his mystery box, is unimportant. she s just the child of some drunk hobos. she s a no one. this infuriates me. there is no reason this character should be this powerful without any training. it took luke months before he became a tenth as powerful as her. ben spent all of his life training with a jedi legend, easily defeated by a girl who didn t think the force was real just a few days ago. it also doesn t help that rey expresses less that the lovechild of bella swan and jimmy stewart. i mean, does she even smile in this movie. at all. 2. another hole in wall do even have to state this. superman leia are so many plot holes in this movie. so. instead of talking about them in long ranting detail, i will just create a list. 1. how did the order get everyone together. 2. where did they get the resources to fund them. 3. why didn t holdor tell them about the plan. she risked a mutiny because she didn t tell them about it. 4. how did the hacker know that they were using escape pods. 5. how do spaceships run out of fuel. this is the first time we ve heard about this risk. 6. why didn t the fuel up earlier. 7. how do bombs fall in 0 gravity. 8. why did ben kill his master. wasn t the point of killing his dad to prove his loyalty to him. 9. why would luke create a map to him if he wanted to be left alone. 10. if lightspeed could destroy a ship like that, why didn t one x wing flying into the death star in iv and cut it in half. 11. when did luke get the jedi texts. 12. how did luke die?

 I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue.,"i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you."," I don't think abortion is a women's rights issue. : i personally draw the line at wherever the baby is conscious, which admittedly i do not know exactly when it happens, but that does not change the nature of my argument since it happens far before birth. the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible. i think this is a foolish argument as once again it's not a matter of just doing what you want with your own body. the third one of my arguments is: people claim it's a right to determine for oneself whether they reproduce. it is someone's right to determine whether or not they reproduce. however that decision is made when they choose to have sex. the risk that was taken can backfire, and given that the sex is consensual, the risk of impregnation is their responsibility. if that risk does indeed backfire, they can not claim a way to get out of it, costing another person their life, and act like it's their 'right' as a person who does not have to forcedly reproduce. now i know that some people are really passionate about this topic, and i want everyone to understand that, i am not trying to offend you.","not at all going into the talking points of abortion, in the most basic of senses, it's a woman's rights issue in the sense that it involves a woman, and whether or not they have the right to get an abortion. so whatever side you're on, it's a woman's rights issue. you're debating whether women have this right or not.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'right to determine for oneself whether or not they reproduce.'if you mean that the baby's rights are more important as the baby is the one being killed for 99 of the time their parents' failure to be responsible, then that's a foolish argument.",i don't think abortion is a women's rights issue. i think it's a woman's right to decide whether or not she wants to have sex with someone she doesn't want to have unprotected sex with.

" Cultural Appropriation is largely misidentified, and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis","some background: i'm a cis, white, liberal woman. this particular opinion i hold is one that tends to clash with the general belief systems of many of the communities and political sects that i consider myself a part of, and that's why i'm coming here to hopefully gain insight into aspects of this phenomenon that i, as a white person, may not realize or understand. i feel like an example scenario may be the best way to explain what i mean, so here we go: jenny is a 16 year old white girl. she lives and goes to school in an area that has a fairly equal population of black people and white people. she has seen black girls online and in school that wear box braids, and she thinks they're beautiful. she regularly compliments all kinds of women on all kinds of hairstyles that she thinks are pretty, and gets inspiration from them all the time. eventually, she decides to go get box braids for herself. she posts a picture on social media and some guy named richard comments 'so hawt! ! ' or something. a look back through richard's post history shows that a week ago he made a post disparaging natural hair hairstyles, calling them 'ghetto', 'trashy', 'ugly', what have you. as annoying sounding a term as it is, i truly do believe that 'cultural appreciation' is a genuine thing although i hate saying it because i feel like it has the same connotation as 'all lives matter' or some shit . anyway, my point here is that jenny loved a certain hairstyle, and acted out of nothing but admiration and respect. had she been the one to previously condemn such a hairstyle when worn by a black woman but gone on to decide that it was 'okay' if she did it, then she certainly would be guilty of ca. in this instance, the only person at fault is richard, who also didn't commit ca, but was absolutely a massively problematic bigot. regardless of whether jenny's hairstyle was what incited richard's hypocrisy, she is not the one responsible for his skewed stances or more accurately, the larger societal views that he represents in this situation . basically: there's no doubt that in many instances, society vilifies an aspect of a certain culture simply for the association with said culture, but then glorifies it when it presents itself among 'white culture'. this is absolutely problematic, but attacking well meaning individuals is the wrong way to deal with it."," Cultural Appropriation is largely misidentified, and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis : some background: i'm a cis, white, liberal woman. this particular opinion i hold is one that tends to clash with the general belief systems of many of the communities and political sects that i consider myself a part of, and that's why i'm coming here to hopefully gain insight into aspects of this phenomenon that i, as a white person, may not realize or understand. i feel like an example scenario may be the best way to explain what i mean, so here we go: jenny is a 16 year old white girl. she lives and goes to school in an area that has a fairly equal population of black people and white people. she has seen black girls online and in school that wear box braids, and she thinks they're beautiful. she regularly compliments all kinds of women on all kinds of hairstyles that she thinks are pretty, and gets inspiration from them all the time. eventually, she decides to go get box braids for herself. she posts a picture on social media and some guy named richard comments 'so hawt! !

or experimenting on live animals to invent things, or just simply to satisfy your scientific curiosity; and if for some reason you like torturing animals, although i don't advocate it, i don't see any reason why you shouldn't as long as that animal isn't someone else's property . about veganism: i don't think we should ban it or anything like that, since as i said if you feel like doing something you should do it, but it is just plain stupid. the problem with this argument is that it can seemingly easily be extended to humans leading to the conclusion that murder and theft are okay. however looking at history we see that quality of life and life expectancy have greatly increased since society formed, therefore forming a society and working together is the most efficient way to 'survive' and by being willing to give up doing some things that we 'feel like doing' like murfer theft or anything that would make society disfunctional we enable ourselves to do so much more . therefore we must shape our morality and law that makes for the most efficient and freest society. because of the social contract: contract giving every human equal rights is the most optimal way to go. to prevent rebellions and such however recklessly sticking to our current morality and not thinking thinks through logically with cold strict reasoning thwarts advancement. for historical examples see slavery because of racism;

 It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa,"high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives."," It's stupid to join a High IQ Society like Mensa : high iq societies are clubs that typically only allow members with a certain iq percentile. people who join these clubs typically do so to indicate that they're intelligent and to socialize with peers who are as intelligent. the reason i think it's stupid is mainly because i believe these people put way too much value into their iq. and iq score is typically a very narrow indicator of intelligence, excluding things like emotional intelligence, creativity and social skills. not to mention it's outdated, since the iq of the general population has been steadily growing, but the average is still set to 100. meaning that and iq of 140 is less impressive than it used to be. which brings me to my main point in that his members overestimate the value of iq, a lot of them probably take much pride over it because they lack other significant achievements in their lives.","i think that if you join any kind of society for the express purpose of being able to brag about your eligibility, you probably have some insecurity to work through but this is hardly unique to members of mensa. another example that comes to mind is paying to be listed in who's who directories and the like. on the other hand, there are people who join societies like this because they enjoy the activities and social programs therein. many older people in particular, who may be lonely, might look for any kind of group or society they are eligible to join. i've never heard a bragging word leave my elderly neighbor's mouth, but she goes to mensa meetings every week because she likes to simultaneously have human interaction and keep her mind sharp by doing brain games with other people who enjoy them. anytime she mentions mensa, it's usually because she want to share a cool puzzle she got there. in brief: if your motive for joining mensa is to brag, then you have issues with insecurity. but that is not the only reason people join mensa. so i think that to say the organization itself is stupid because a certain subset of its members join only for status is not a tenable argument. societal attitudes toward praising intelligence or other heritable traits is a separate issue entirely, of which certain individuals' mensa membership is at most a byproduct.","i don't think it's stupid to have a high iq club, but i think it is stupid to allow people with low iq to join it. i'm not sure what you mean by 'low iq.

' 3. i'm not really sure what work 'regiment' is doing in your definition, but this is the part that seems to least relevant to fascism. economic interventionism, the left most certainly is. but that does not make them any more or any less fascist than the right. amp; x200b;","i'm not sure what you mean by 'fascism' or 'fascist', but i think it's important to distinguish between the two. fascism is the idea that the government has complete power over the people, and that the people have the right to decide what is and isn't allowed to do with their own property. this is not the case in the united states, where the government does not have complete power, but rather the people's right to choose what they want to do","i'm not sure what you mean by 'fascism' or 'far right', but i think it's important to note that you're talking about the left and right, not the right. the left is far right, but the right is far left, and the left isn't far right."
" Attaining biological immortality would not be good for the human species and, ultimately, is a selfish idea.","firstly, this post is inspired and essentially a response to the following two videos by youtuber cgp grey: typically, i love content from this channel, but i find myself vehemently disagreeing with the simplicity of his view about the function of death as a part of life. the following are reasons why i believe death needs to happen. the idea that suddenly everyone will be immune to death, and that the last person will die forever is preposterous. this would cause widespread issues including backlash from those whos religion does not agree with immortality, for example panic, and most likely a desperate struggle for people to gain access to this 'death cure'. the presence of a death cure itself would cause a great deal of chaos, and even if the chaos ends one day, there will be other issues that arise 2: having a world where old ideas, practices, beliefs, and ideologies remain with the people who hold them sounds awful. the way things are now, new people are being born every day bringing new points of view, movements, and ideas forward. with new generations comes innovation and change. think of some of the points of view or ideologies held by people as early as 20 years ago. now think about 50 years ago. 100 years? the world we live in has drastically changed with our new ideas. for this reason the cycling of human life is necessary. those who are old overwhelmingly tend to become stuck in their ways, believing that their longevity makes their points of view valid. curing a death will either put a halt to this change, or slow it dramatically due to the need to control our population. 3: having a cure for death would require us to impose extreme controls on our population. currently, our population is growing at an alarming rate, while the condition of our planet deteriorates. if we find a death cure, and continue to grow in the same way, we will very quickly outgrow our means for sustaining ourselves. the solution to this problem would be imposing extreme controls on who can breed and when. these things would need to be monitored, and rules would need to be enforced. i don't think i need to describe the dystopian future that this would create. the idea of even being able to successfully control the breeding of 7 billion people is extremely difficult. rather than keeping one organism alive for a potential eternity, it is far easier to have that organism breed, multiply, and have their offspring do the same. this allows for the spreading favorable traits, creating new and better version of each organism. 5: with an eternity to live, inevitably you will get bored. sooner or later in an infinite time span you will no longer be able to find joy in what mortal life might have to offer. when you've seen an done everything over an infinite amount of time, you'll eventually decide it's time to check out anyway. this isn't inherently bad, a desire to live is necessary for life to carry on. cmv currently my comments aren't coming through properly are being tacked on to the wrong posts. i will reply to comments as soon as i can."," Attaining biological immortality would not be good for the human species and, ultimately, is a selfish idea. : firstly, this post is inspired and essentially a response to the following two videos by youtuber cgp grey: typically, i love content from this channel, but i find myself vehemently disagreeing with the simplicity of his view about the function of death as a part of life. the following are reasons why i believe death needs to happen. the idea that suddenly everyone will be immune to death, and that the last person will die forever is preposterous. this would cause widespread issues including backlash from those whos religion does not agree with immortality, for example panic, and most likely a desperate struggle for people to gain access to this 'death cure'. the presence of a death cure itself would cause a great deal of chaos, and even if the chaos ends one day, there will be other issues that arise 2: having a world where old ideas, practices, beliefs, and ideologies remain with the people who hold them sounds awful. the way things are now, new people are being born every day bringing new points of view, movements, and ideas forward. with new generations comes innovation and change. think of some of the points of view or ideologies held by people as early as 20 years ago. now think about 50 years ago. 100 years?

 Racial fetishism isn't wrong,"i don't see what's wrong with that. it's perfectly understandable in other contexts. people want their partner to be good on the inside, but also on the outside. like, i'm sure most of you reading this would not date a severely physically disabled person. so why is it wrong when this logic is applied to race? it doesn't affect anyone if, for example, i wouldn't be happy to commit to a black or brown woman, thus i draw the conclusion that it's okay. even if i'd be considered racist. it's a harmless form of racism."," Racial fetishism isn't wrong : i don't see what's wrong with that. it's perfectly understandable in other contexts. people want their partner to be good on the inside, but also on the outside. like, i'm sure most of you reading this would not date a severely physically disabled person. so why is it wrong when this logic is applied to race? it doesn't affect anyone if, for example, i wouldn't be happy to commit to a black or brown woman, thus i draw the conclusion that it's okay. even if i'd be considered racist. it's a harmless form of racism.","i think people why strong racial preferences are attracted to a combination of different facial, cultural and physical features that people of a particular race tend to exhibit. i used to date white girls who were thick, had a lot of curves and full lips and it wasn t till i went to college and realized these features were present in literally every african american girl. think features, not races.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'racism', but i think it's important to note that there are a lot of different types of racism. for example, if you want to date a black person, you should date a white person. if you don't, you shouldn't date a non black person.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'fetishism', but i think it's important to note that there are a lot of people who are attracted to people of different races. for example, if you're attracted to someone of a certain race, you might be attracted to a person of a different race, but that doesn't mean that you don't want to date that person. i'm not saying that you shouldn't date people of other races, but i'm saying"

 Not everyone should be allowed to have children,"the three main bases of assessment would be: 1 financial economic, 2 psychologically, 3 criminal history. 1. economically financially: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to provide for the child's basic needs housing, food, reasonable estimate of healthcare etc. , and education at least through high school . this would be based on a holistic assessment of the person's and or couple's current income both active and passive , earning potential, availability of fairly liquid capital; the total earning potential should be able to cover the benchmarked costs for the above mentioned necessities without incurring excess debt i haven't calculated exactly what that'd be, but it'd be leveraging themselves up to a certain percentage of their current income 2. psychologically: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they pass a psychological evaluation that deems them fit to be parenting. i haven't completed figured out what the guidelines would be yet, but it would basically have to demonstrate that the person or couple doesn't have any severe mental disorders nor a recurring history of disorders . 3. criminal history: the person or couple cannot have a lengthy or recurring history of criminal activities this would be based on a has a lengthy history of criminal offenses; not civil offenses their past would need to be evaluated and indexed based on severity; e. g. first degree murder would pretty much rule out your chances, while involuntary manslaughter would be need to be further examined . ultimately, i think successfully implementing these measures would: increase gdp per capita, increase household income per capita, increase household expenditure per capita, decrease income inequality, increase literacy rates, reduce violent crime, decrease household debt, reduce underemployment and unemployment note: unemployment is different from underemployment . these quantitative changes would also qualitatively lead to a 'better society' with a higher quality of living. this is still a developing view, but it's a rough idea that i've been thinking about recently. i did a lazy job of fully fleshing out my thoughts because there're just way too many changes and causal links to list, but feel free to pick something and question it. you won't be able to cmv if you talk about how this isn't feasible in terms of implementation."," Not everyone should be allowed to have children : the three main bases of assessment would be: 1 financial economic, 2 psychologically, 3 criminal history. 1. economically financially: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to provide for the child's basic needs housing, food, reasonable estimate of healthcare etc. , and education at least through high school . this would be based on a holistic assessment of the person's and or couple's current income both active and passive , earning potential, availability of fairly liquid capital; the total earning potential should be able to cover the benchmarked costs for the above mentioned necessities without incurring excess debt i haven't calculated exactly what that'd be, but it'd be leveraging themselves up to a certain percentage of their current income 2. psychologically: the person or couple must be able to demonstrate that they pass a psychological evaluation that deems them fit to be parenting. i haven't completed figured out what the guidelines would be yet, but it would basically have to demonstrate that the person or couple doesn't have any severe mental disorders nor a recurring history of disorders . 3. criminal history: the person or couple cannot have a lengthy or recurring history of criminal activities this would be based on a has a lengthy history of criminal offenses; not civil offenses their past would need to be evaluated and indexed based on severity; e. g. first degree murder would pretty much rule out your chances, while involuntary manslaughter would be need to be further examined . ultimately, i think successfully implementing these measures would: increase gdp per capita, increase household income per capita, increase household expenditure per capita, decrease income inequality, increase literacy rates, reduce violent crime, decrease household debt, reduce underemployment and unemployment note: unemployment is different from underemployment . these quantitative changes would also qualitatively lead to a 'better society' with a higher quality of living. this is still a developing view, but it's a rough idea that i've been thinking about recently. i did a lazy job of fully fleshing out my thoughts because there're just way too many changes and causal links to list, but feel free to pick something and question it. you won't be able to cmv if you talk about how this isn't feasible in terms of implementation.",what sorts of ways are you imagining implementing a ban?

position of the dnc, as stated in the 2016 democratic platform preventing gun violence with 33,000 americans dying every year, democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence. while responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in america have suffered from gun violence. we can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. to build on the success of the lifesaving brady handgun violence prevention act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy; and keep weapons of war such as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines lcam's off our streets. we will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. there is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue. what part of this troubles you enough to vote for someone from a different party? note that in these modern times, the 4th amendment is much more important than

Most recreational drugs should be legalised.,"the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why? well when any society attempts to control the consumption of any substance by banning it, we get black markets. that is essentially all strict drug laws do, they create a black market. that black market fuels organised crime and demonises certain persons from society. my second reason, is that if you legalise certain drugs people are consuming anyway you remove the taboo of them seeking help if they become addicted. as it currently stands there is help for those who want to quit smoking tobacco or quit consuming alcohol. these drugs are arguably far worse than most other substances available on the black market. my last reason is i fully believe that a lot of people can take other substances responsibly, in the same way one consumes alcohol. not every user is an addict. i think we need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable. i welcome any counter arguments here, in which may change my view.","Most recreational drugs should be legalised. : the subject of drug usage can sometimes be a somewhat taboo subject. some people are very conservative about this and others are not. why? well when any society attempts to control the consumption of any substance by banning it, we get black markets. that is essentially all strict drug laws do, they create a black market. that black market fuels organised crime and demonises certain persons from society. my second reason, is that if you legalise certain drugs people are consuming anyway you remove the taboo of them seeking help if they become addicted. as it currently stands there is help for those who want to quit smoking tobacco or quit consuming alcohol. these drugs are arguably far worse than most other substances available on the black market. my last reason is i fully believe that a lot of people can take other substances responsibly, in the same way one consumes alcohol. not every user is an addict. i think we need to stop demonising people for wanting to let off some steam by taking a substance that allows them to make their lives that bit more bearable. i welcome any counter arguments here, in which may change my view.","i would say yes, ideally most recreational substances would be legal, however, each place has different histories with recreational substances, different laws, different societal beliefs, that would significantly impact the way they would be received. in a significantly religious state, there may be more of a backlash, people may interpret the state supporting the legalisation as a move against the grain or the tenets of the major religion. a state with a significant drug problem, may abuse the legalisation of such substances and temporarily regress into a self indulgent binge, while states with less prominent social problems may be relatively unchanged by the move, with those that partake in recreational consumption of drugs no longer threatened hindered by the laws that previously restricted use and possession. really subjective, no one knows what will happen. while some countries have had notable success in the legalisation of some or all substances, in conjunction with controls against the production, acquisition and resale or substances, this is not necessarily the result other countries would experience. whatever countries decide to do is a risk. countries that permit more freedom in regards to all aspects of illicit substances are taking a significant risk. whether a given country is willing to take on such a risk is subject to so many variables that are beyond the bounds of discussion of this post.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i'm going to try to change your view. first of all, i think it's important to note that there are a lot of people who are addicted to drugs, and there are plenty of people that are not addicted to them. i don't think you're going to be able to convince me that there is a 'black market' for these drugs. i'm not going to convince you that there isn't a","i don't think it's a good idea to legalize recreational drugs, but i do think it should be legalised."
" Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance.","let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k. 's claims that he did not fully understand how much power he wielded over these individuals because of his celebrity. to his cr, in every one of these instances, c. k. did ask before committing these acts. these instances seemed to happen at the time when his career was first starting to really flourish. i take him for his word when he said he didn t understand how, in his newly found celebrity, asking wasn t really asking. that is in no way an excuse for what c. k. did because his behavior was still wildly inappropriate, but i am still somewhat sympathetic to his explanation, which leads into my third point 3 lack of predatory nature: louis c. k. made bad judgments, but his behavior does not seem predatory to me the same way cosby's, spacey's, and weinstein s were. he never threatened to ruin a woman's career for not allowing him to expose himself in front of them, and based on the information we currently have, it seems as if this behavior stopped at some point. now, it is alleged that c. k. s agent david becky may have made vague threats on louis' behalf to the women who accused him, but i don't think that is enough to put that blame on louis. it is possible becky was acting without c. k. s knowledge. furthermore, when the ny times article was published, i found louis c. k. 's response to be a no bs acknowledgement of both the accusations and the hurt he caused. i think we have to give c. k. crfor that. 5 a learning moment: undoubtedly, the importance of metoo is that it finally gives victims of sexual assault a voice. but perhaps also we should hear from truly contrite men who have behaved inappropriately in the past to understand their reasoning and learn from their thoughts and regrets. i don t believe we should give predatory monsters like cosby, spacey, and weinstein a voice to explain their actions. it may be too soon for c. k. to make a comeback , but i think some day he should be allowed to."," Of all the men (rightfully) accused in the wake #MeToo, Louis C.K. deserves a second chance. : let me say at the outset that what louis c. k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons. this post is in no way a defense of what he did; it is, however, trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse. i understand this opinion is a unpopular one, but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post, and explain to me their viewpoints. i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue. i also want to say that i am a man, but my family has been affected by sexual abuse. at the end of the day, while i believe louis c. k. should be punished in the court of public opinion, i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey, bill cosby, and harvey weinstein, for the following reasons: 1 degree of the accusations: i believe that 'bad things' have degrees. unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse. i don't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person's own body, as was the case with cosby, spacey, and weinstein. i think that the physical violation of another person's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person, but that is not what louis c. k. did. of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article, none of them involved physical contact. there is one anecdote about louis possibly shoving a women into a bathroom , but as of now we don t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved. no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this. 2 a reasonable explanation: in his response to the ny times article, i am sympathetic to c. k.

 I believe nudity should not be illegal,"so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic."," I believe nudity should not be illegal : so there's some nuance to my beliefs here. if someone is caught outside without clothing then there shouldn't be any sort of repercussions or fines that affect them for being naked outdoors. in public transportation, like on buses or trains, we shouldn't have public nudity because of the issue of transference of germs between people because of contact on the seats. this change would be primarily for two purposes: first 1 to get rid of the laws and fines that are placed on people for being naked. given certain circumstances these sorts of laws can be detrimental towards people, and punishes them for simply being in their most natural state. and 2 to allow people the freedom to express their bodies publicly how they wish to without fear of punishment by the law. simple rules like 'no shirts, no shoes, no service' would still be applicable towards those facilities that choose to enact them. for those who don't know, in spain nudity is legal minus a few regions like in barcelona. this doesn't mean that public nudity is acceptable everywhere, there's a lot of places where nudity is gonna be looked down on, such as in the middle of a town. but it's still legalized and the country itself has a lot of options for interested people like nudists. last thing to cover is probably going to be religious and moral beliefs that are going to possibly be affected by this. to which my best argument that i can come up with is the rule of freedom of expression. in the united states at least, this is part of one of the biggest rights we have: freedom of speech. i don't think we should be limiting our expression by enacting certain laws with how we present our bodies, even if that presentation means no clothing at all. so there's my case, let's see yours. i'd love for you guys to tear into it! let's discuss this topic.","honestly my first thought, what if ladies leave snail trails on park benches and weird dudes with boners get their pre on stuff that we'll all touch? it's a fucked up idea but cmon i'm thinking if you let people be naked in a place like nyc, there would be way too much weird fucking shit going on man.",i don't see how this is going to change your view. i don't think it's going to make much difference. i think it would make more sense for the government to regulate public nudity in a way that doesn't infringe on freedom of expression.,"i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to note that nudity is not a protected right. it's a protected protected right, and it's not something that should be infringed on. i don't think it should be illegal to be naked in public, but it should not be illegal for people to be nude in public."

 Public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a major part of the base curriculum.,"if you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . also, i m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. i m not talking about teaching kids a few basic

work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on subjects of mental health and happiness because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps

that science to students as they live with emotional responses as a constant and resonating force in their own minds and as they interact with others in any all situation s could very likely improve productivity and senses of fulfillment and belonging for millions of people and generations to come. i should also note that saying 'math and english' was not specific. i was just bringing up two

 The US needs a Constitutional Convention,"hopefully this isn't too common a topic on cmv; the last post to put it this way was 2 years ago and more recent ones were more narrowly defined and are nearly a year old themselves . it had a great run it's the oldest constitution in continuous use, but most modern constitutions are written to be updated more frequently and actually are. ours is only really updated by supreme court decisions, with only 2 amendments being ratified in the last 50 years one of which was first proposed in 1789! til . the founders could not have imagined the world we live in today or its challenges, and the document is written as such. flawed solutions like the electoral college were created to solve problems of the 18th century that are irrelevant in the 21st. the founding fathers saw tyrannical government as the biggest threats to the rights of individuals, and wrote the constitution to protect those rights. that was logical in their day, but that is not the threat that those of us in modern democracies face. tyrannical companies taking from an article that's currently on the front page are the primary threat to individual rights and freedoms, and our government and constitution is not equipped to deal with that threat. i'm sure i'll get into more specific critiques in the comments, but that buildup of history and precedent makes justice incredibly difficult to come by in many instances and needs revision. if you haven't, i'd urge you to read the text. it takes like 20 minutes for the main text; probably 40 60 with amendments and is available everywhere. one of the main arguments that will likely be raised that will not change my view is the political will difficulty argument. i know it would be hard or impossible to make happen, especially given current politics."," The US needs a Constitutional Convention : hopefully this isn't too common a topic on cmv; the last post to put it this way was 2 years ago and more recent ones were more narrowly defined and are nearly a year old themselves . it had a great run it's the oldest constitution in continuous use, but most modern constitutions are written to be updated more frequently and actually are. ours is only really updated by supreme court decisions, with only 2 amendments being ratified in the last 50 years one of which was first proposed in 1789! til . the founders could not have imagined the world we live in today or its challenges, and the document is written as such. flawed solutions like the electoral college were created to solve problems of the 18th century that are irrelevant in the 21st. the founding fathers saw tyrannical government as the biggest threats to the rights of individuals, and wrote the constitution to protect those rights. that was logical in their day, but that is not the threat that those of us in modern democracies face. tyrannical companies taking from an article that's currently on the front page are the primary threat to individual rights and freedoms, and our government and constitution is not equipped to deal with that threat. i'm sure i'll get into more specific critiques in the comments, but that buildup of history and precedent makes justice incredibly difficult to come by in many instances and needs revision. if you haven't, i'd urge you to read the text. it takes like 20 minutes for the main text; probably 40 60 with amendments and is available everywhere. one of the main arguments that will likely be raised that will not change my view is the political will difficulty argument. i know it would be hard or impossible to make happen, especially given current politics.",there is a legal process for corporations attacking your personal freedoms. and the reason as to why the government is so restrictive might be because of the preventions of abuse. you will always have an advocate and a watchdog if the government holds checks and balances as well as consistent preventions of abuse. overhauling the constitution specifically to be anti business by premise will send the country into an indefinite dark age. if you have grievances with corporations use the courts to make constitutional amendments proving that corporations are anti freedom in nuisance ways.,the constitution was written to protect individual rights and freedoms. it was written as a way to protect the rights of the people. it is not a way for the government to protect those rights. the constitution is a way of protecting the people from tyrannical government.,"the constitution was written to protect the rights of the people, not the constitution itself."
Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law,"my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","Roe v Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned in all states by Federal Law : my first point is that the constitution says life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. if a tree is considered a living thing then why do abortion supporters say a fetus is not alive ? roe v. wade was a decision made from bad judgement by the court which completely ignored the constitution. abortion is premated murder. the courts should recognize this. some abortion advocates say that banning abortion would lead to people doing back alley abortions. so what ? they are putting themselves at risk to commit this horrible act. just because criminals do not like the law does not mean we should accommodate for them. it is like saying murder should be legalized because people will kill. another argument that pro abortion advocates say is that cost will increase. the solution is to get rid of socialist policies. then only the parents will be responsible for the cost of the child. some argue the government should pay for birth control. i think this is silly. the best form of birth control is abstinence. the government should not pay for people because they lack self control or only think about the immediate consequences. tax payer money should never fund birth control. birth control is unnecessary when one practices abstinence. if they want birth control they should pay for it.","sorry, u asianviolinist98 your submission has been removed for breaking rule b: you must personally hold the view and demonstrate that you are open to it changing . a post cannot be on behalf of others, playing devil's advocate, or 'soapboxing'. see the wiki page for more information if you would like to appeal, message the moderators by clicking this link please note that multiple violations will lead to a ban, as explained in our moderation standards","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i'm going to try to change your view. you seem to be saying that abortion is premated murder, but that's not the case. you're saying that the government should pay for birth control, but you're also saying that people should be responsible for the cost of the child's care. i'm not going to argue that this is the case, but it seems to me that you're making the argument that","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i'm going to try to change your view in a way that makes sense to me. i'm not going to argue that abortion is premated murder, i'm just going to point out that it's not. if a fetus is not a living thing, then why do abortion supporters say that it should be legalized because people will kill? that's not what roe v. wade was about. it was about"

 A joint account with a percentage-of-income (with a few other considerations) is the best way to split money,"i know this can have a lot of exceptions. please don't make your arguments about pointing out 2 or 3 exceptions that are technically true. i'll list a few to save the trouble: a person with reckless spending or addiction gambling issues should not have this split. significant inheritances should not necessarily have this split the extremely rich or extremely poor should not necessarily have this split massive debts massive differences in work time lots of other exceptions but for most people, i think this split is the best method. money has an economic value. if you compare the salary of a strategic consulting manager and a veterinarian assistant, you're going to get 200k versus 40k or something crazy. but in a relationship, i don't think economic value should necessarily be considered, unless the difference in income is so vast that one person's income is literally chump change i. e. 500k vs 30k . in a relationship, especially that of a marriage, the 'most important value' is time and effort of the individual. person1 makes 80k after taxes; person2 makes 40k. person1 would input 40k into their joint account, while person2 inputs 20k. as a result, in real money, person1 is providing more. person2 is also providing 50 . caveat. please read this caveat. let's say for example i make 100k and my partner makes 20k. i put in 50k and keep 50k while she puts in 10k and keeps 10k. unfortunately, that means that i get to live it up and have a pretty damn good life whereas she has to keep both savings and expenses under 800 per month. so why this view? 1. 2. provides freedom to both people and rewards high earners in exchange for providing more this allows both parties to win. 3. this makes their life much more difficult and makes them less capable of affording more. 4. gifts are more meaningful in a fully shared money situation, gifts are important but also become difficult to justify. makes for a difficult situation. 5. use your own money. no problem! want to buy a ps4?

" I would have a happier, more fulfilled life if I didn't have to work.","this belief dives into many parts of my life so i'll go through each. to me, working makes us slaves. people are forced to get jobs just to survive. everyday feels like a fight for my life. i feel as though if people were told that they could have food, water, a house, car and education for free, then we would have no worries to just do what we wanted to do with our lives. personally, if i could just spend my days carving wood, writing a book, or anything leisurely by myself, i would do it. don't confuse that sentence with

the 'liesure leading to depression' answers. so i feel the need to expand my post to include that i'm more referring to working to survive. generally, i'm a busy body but working to survive is awful.

response, my anxiety and i don't want that. it's become clear that many are focusing on the 'needing some work for fulfillment' and the 'liesure leading to depression' answers. so i feel the need to expand my post to include that i'm more referring to working to survive. generally, i'm a busy body but working to survive is awful. maybe the cmv is actually 'the need for money survival prevents me from living a fulfilling life'. some have confused my desire to live a life without a need for survival as a desire to have anyone else help me survive and in that you'd be wrong. a stress free life for every person without a need for them to survive. ideally currently unrealistic , people just would survive. i don't know how i'm sure we're hundreds of years away from this solution and it would take more than just me to figure it out but it's beside the point. some believe that i think that things are just going to appear but throughout, i've only referenced resources necessary for survival. just a world where your basic needs are met. that doesn't mean tv, or movies, or anything that you don't absolutely need. those other things are wants not needs. so if you wanted something, of course you'd work for it. but if you needed something, that's different.","depends on how you mean. if you mean live in the current society but without working and everyone else does, with you being unaffected, or society doesn t truly exist and everyone is free to do whatever. either way, you can look at it from this pov. the human brain naturally gives incentive to progress, weather its building shelters, eating food or getting money, the brain rewards good actions that help the body. but the world has changed since we truly had to hunt food. so many replaced that with there jobs. and money being the prey. the brain rewards you for progression at work, like a raise. because the brain loves to work on big projects that take a ton of time. without the jobs, you wouldn t get the reward. this is where a lot of rich people get depression. they have reached the peak and can t go any farther up. obviously find a job your interested in and can stick with so your brain can make you happy.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to note that you're talking about a world where people are forced to get jobs just to survive. if you want to live a fulfilling life, you need to work for it.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to remember that you're not talking about a world without jobs, but rather a world where people are forced to get jobs just to survive."

" Poe Dameron was not simply just wrong for questioning Admiral Holdo and taking action, nor was he the ""true villain"" of TLJ.","i think i maybe should've made this 'cmv: holdo should have done something to inspire all members of the resistance to trust in her and not come up with a plan of their own especially considering poe's history . ' poe obviously made some serious mistakes previously, but i believe that in regards to the chase and their plans, he and holdo were both right and wrong in some respects. i recently had a discussion with someone where they told me that they thought that he should have just trusted her and done as he was told, that all in the military should always follow their orders without question though i'm not trying to open another rabbit hole with that , and that the scene was meant to illustrate how men need to just shut up and listen to women. she may have had a plan and it may have worked and by that one could argue that she was right; i see this as a parallel to the jedi at large. i believe this ties in with luke's saying the jedi need to end and all of that to illustrate how even if one group may be in some way right, if they can't effectively communicate why they're right or something else to get people to trust in it enough to actually implement it, it's not going to succeed or produce the desired change or outcome regardless. like how much anakin was preached to about the evils of the dark side but was never communicated the realities of it well enough to successfully instill in him what it would take to get him to have not gone down that path. holdo failed as a leader by failing to instill the faith in her needed for her plan to work successfully. it's 100 fair for her to not have wanted to divulge specific details in an effort to safeguard the plan, but given what she thought of poe as a person i think it's completely fair to say that she definitely should have at least simply told him that she did have a plan and that she wasn't just going to let them all die without even trying to do anything, which is what she led them to believe was happening. she didn't even have a look of confidence when saying what she said to the crew, again that could have been intentional in an effort to keep the plan secret, but she should have said something more to, at least, poe. what good is a leader who knows exactly how to fix all our problems if they aren't actually a leader and can't get people to actually do the things to make those changes happen? poe was faced with a situation where he was basically told that they were just going to fly til they ran out of fuel and the enemies caught up and killed them, without even trying to do anything about it. he was given, so far as i perceived, no reason to support this order other than the fact that she was of superior rank. he made the call in his mind that since they were just going to let them all die that he would at least come up with a plan to try and do something about it, a plan which a black guy and an asian woman both also supported and helped to come up with but no one seems to talk about the black guy or asian woman who also didn't follow holdo and supported taking action on their own . this whole thing seems to be getting reduced to being about sex, or more specifically, the evils of white males and the patriarchy, and the fact that a black guy and asian woman also opposed holdo doesn't fit in with that notion very well. the other person also said how if he just would have followed his superior's order how the plan would have worked perfectly. one could, perhaps fairly, say that this wouldn't even be a factor or a point for me to make if he had followed orders, but i can also, i believe fairly, say that if finn and rose had followed orders and gotten the right person at the casino instead of deciding that they could make due with the option that presented itself as opposed to the one they were ordered to find that then poe's plan would have worked. really, both plans could have actually simultaneously worked. if finn and rose had gotten the right person and managed to covertly board the enemy ship and disable their shields, anyone not necessary for the fight could have escaped in the landing pods and just a few could have stayed back to try and destroy the enemy ship; in which case they would again already be facing death and if the battle started going south then they could have still simply flew lightspeed through it as holdo did on her own. i may be wrong but i think it's also fair to speculate that it would have taken fewer people in the ship for the battle than the number that died in the pods in the failed escape attempt. the last jedi, to me, was about how much more complicated these things are than any of us generally like to contend with. about the problems with the mindset of 'i'm right so you just need to shut up and do what i say because i'm right. ' they may damn well be right but that is certainly not an effective way to act because it will not inspire people to come to follow you. we must demand more of our leaders and we must be more sympathetic to and have more empathy for those we view as being in opposition to us, if not out of care for them out of care for actually advancing your own correctness instead of just ranting about how smart you are and how dumb everyone else is and how the world would be so much better if we just listened to you continuously because no matter how much you rant it doesn't cause the change you wish to see. yoda told luke that the best thing he may have to offer as a teaching are his mistakes, and from that he tells leia that no one is ever really gone. they can't give up on kylo, ben is still there. luke can't try to kill his nephew because of a dream he had and we can't declare people to be evil and delete them from our lives because they voted for trump. if we actually are so much smarter and want the world to be better then we need to be better and we need to do more and we need to care and work not just within the frame of how we feel things should be people should just follow orders and consider and work also based on how things actually are at the present moment consider your feeling that this person is wreckless and in your mind simply sexist and realize that they will probably not follow you if you don't do something more to get them to, regardless of whether that's something you should have to do or not . that is not, however, to say that we shouldn't also work to move things in the direction of how they should be. tldr some are acting like it's just an issue of sexism and i think that's an almost comically absurd i say almost because it's too troubling to really be funny for me, i thought the movie made such a beautiful statement that seeing it so severely oversimplified and misperceived damn near makes me sick oversimplification at best and to a degree just plain wrong."," Poe Dameron was not simply just wrong for questioning Admiral Holdo and taking action, nor was he the ""true villain"" of TLJ. : i think i maybe should've made this 'cmv: holdo should have done something to inspire all members of the resistance to trust in her and not come up with a plan of their own especially considering poe's history .

 Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing,"for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me? ' and you're reluctant to tell them the real reason, you're probably using them and you should probably break up with them. response 1: 'as long as it's between consenting adults, there's nothing wrong with it and we shouldn't judge them too harshly. ' consent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an action to be ethical. that is, for a relationship to be ethical, it must at a minimum be consensual, but it takes more than that. it must also be genuinely good in the long term for all parties involved. for instance, it wouldn't be ethical for two completely incompatible people to date each other just because they're both terrified of being alone, even if they both consent to it. they could even hurt others if they have children. response 2: 'as long as you're upfront about your motives, you're in the clear. ' few people are willing to be so upfront, precisely because they're aware of how much it makes them sound like a sociopath. 'i had a bad breakup and i'm just looking for a rebound. you cool with that? ' few people say that sort of thing upfront. and if you are upfront, sure, it may lessen your burden of guilt, but that doesn't mean you should be doing it in the first place. if you sell someone placebo drugs, and you tell them upfront, 'hey these drugs probably won't do a damn thing. i'm just trying to make a cheap buck. ' and they buy them anyway, sure, that's better than lying to them about it. but isn't it even better not to sell placebo drugs at all? similarly, if someone's just a rebound for you, it's better if you tell them that upfront rather than make them think they're special, but isn't it better still not to use someone that way in the first place? besides, our motives are often obscure even to ourselves. we may not realize someone was a rebound until the relationship is over. if you're not really, truly excited about someone after a few dates, then what are you still doing with them? response 3: sex is no big deal. it's just our messed up society that puts such an unhealthy emphasis on it. our society probably does have an unhealthy attitude toward sex. but sex is a big deal, and it's not just another activity like skiing. otherwise, we can't explain why forced sex is a special kind of crime. here's what i mean. rape is a serious crime, one that can potentially cause serious psychological damage. likewise, it's a serious crime for an adult to have sex with a child. part of the reason is that they can't meaningfully consent to sex. but why is meaningful consent necessary in this case? young children can't meaningfully consent to getting their hair cut or being taken skiing, either, but that's no crime. rape and sex with children are evil because it's a particularly heinous type of violation, perhaps a violation of something that should be sacred. it's not just an activity that our society places too much emphasis on. sex is intimate in a way that can cause lasting psychological damage if forced upon someone. presumably this is because sex is so deeply rooted in our biology that we can't help but have certain psychological reactions to it. sex does something to you, and you can't necessarily help it no matter how enlightened you are. or even if you can completely separate sex from all the messy emotions, you can't know if your casual partner is capable of doing the same, because you don't know them well. if sex is special, perhaps even sacred, we're playing with fire if we act as if it's no big deal. we risk hurting ourselves and others psychologically, even if it's all perfectly consensual. addendum: there's some part of me that still feels like i'm being ridiculous and unrealistic about my approach to dating, but my conscience won't be clear unless i can see why. or if i'm not being ridiculous, then at least i'll feel more confident about refusing to date anyone for any reason who doesn't meet my possibly unrealistic standards. i can't seem to settle this on my own, so i would appreciate some outside perspective and wisdom."," Casual dating (and casual sex) is inherently dehumanizing : for instance, if you date someone just to make your ex jealous, you're clearly using and dehumanizing your partner. that example's pretty clearly wrong, but there are lots more that seem pretty innocent at first: if you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? if you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? if you date someone in school you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? if you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated? it seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. i can't think of any. a good rule of thumb might be: if your partner asks, 'why did you decide to go out with me?

' and they buy them anyway, sure, that's better than lying to them about it. but isn't it even better not to sell placebo drugs at all? similarly, if someone's just a rebound for you, it's better if you tell them that upfront rather than make them think they're special, but isn't it better still not to use someone that way in the first place? besides, our motives are often obscure even to ourselves. we may not realize someone was a rebound until the relationship is over. if you're not really, truly excited about someone after a few dates, then what are you still doing with them? response 3: sex is no big deal. it's just our messed up society that puts such an unhealthy emphasis on it. our society probably does have an unhealthy attitude toward sex. but sex is a big deal, and it's not just another activity like skiing. otherwise, we can't explain why forced sex is a special kind of crime. here's what i mean. rape is a serious crime, one that can potentially cause serious psychological damage. likewise, it's a serious crime for an adult to have sex with a child. part of the reason is that they can't meaningfully consent to sex. but why is meaningful consent necessary in this case? young children can't meaningfully consent to getting their hair cut or being taken skiing, either, but that's no crime. rape and sex with children are evil because it's a particularly heinous type of violation, perhaps a violation of something that should be sacred. it's not just an activity that our society places too much emphasis on. sex is intimate in a way that can cause lasting psychological damage if forced upon someone. presumably this is because sex is so deeply rooted in our biology that we can't help but have certain psychological reactions to it. sex does something to you, and you can't necessarily help it no matter how enlightened you are. or even if you can completely separate sex from all the messy emotions, you can't know if your casual partner is capable of doing the same, because you don't know them well. if sex is special, perhaps even sacred, we're playing with fire if we act as if it's no big deal. we risk hurting ourselves and others psychologically, even if it's all perfectly consensual. addendum: there's some part of me that still feels like i'm being ridiculous and unrealistic about my approach to dating, but my conscience won't be clear unless i can see why. or if i'm not being ridiculous, then at least i'll feel more confident about refusing to date anyone for any reason who doesn't meet my possibly unrealistic standards. i can't seem to settle this on my own, so i would appreciate some outside perspective and wisdom.","i take issue with your title's phrasing:casual dating and casual sex is inherently dehumanizing i don't expect this road to lead anywhere to a delta but humans in their natural habitats as can be seen with tribal cultures around the world treat sex very differently. that's not to say that dating doesn't exist but sex is seen very differently, as is the culture surrounding it. i would say it can't be inherently dehumanizing if our natural views toward sex and natural inclinations lean elsewhere.","i don't think it's fair to judge someone based on their actions, but i think it is reasonable to judge people based on the actions of their partners. for example, if you're dating someone you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you date someone you don't want to date because you're sick of being single, is it okay to treat them as you would want to be treated","i don't know if i can change your view, but i think it's important to remember that you're talking about casual dating, not casual sex. if you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? if you date someone casually, you're treating them as you would want to be treated, and you're clearly using them as a substitute"

 Liberals have lost the desire to convince conservatives.,"i recently went to a talk on free speech and hate speech. one of the biggest take aways i got was the amount of applause a line from someone when they said something allong the lines of 'who are you the oppressor to define what hate speech is for us the oppressed .

Alcoholics Anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasn't tried to improve it's system since it's inception,"i have a friend who has been attending aa meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a dui for the record i don't know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or 'choose' jailtime and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not aa works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program. below i've listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner. this means that i m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change. 1. we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable. 2. came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understoodhim. 4. made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. admitted to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character. 7. humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings. 8. made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. sought through prayer and mation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. 12. my current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30 s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases. here are some of my thoughts on the matter. first up, as many have pointed out, there's a whole lot of god involved throughout the 12 steps 6 direct references and 7 if you count 2 , i'm not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend. if a person does not believe in god they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety. if alcoholism is a disease then why does aa treat it simply as a matter of will power? i wouldn't try to treat cancer with prayer alone, and for the record there are various medical treatments for alcoholism. there is also a stigma of personal failure when people relapse which doesn't make sense for a couple of reasons. first, if it's a disease then people are sick which means that blaming them for not being able to control their health adds a layer of shame which can only do harm to the person's primary goal of getting sober. in turn this will increase the time to get sober because it will add time to get over that shame before starting again. shame does nothing to help get a person back on track as far as i can tell. second, you would never assign blame to a person with cancer who has gone into remission and then had the cancer come back, why would we do the same for literally any other illness? we wouldn't accept that from any other sort of treatment. if we didn't collect that information we would still have the same poor treatment of hiv that we did in the 80s and 90s, same goes for cancer, and just about any other illness you can name. finally it seems that aa believes it s program is a one size fits all program when we know that many ailments require different treatments for different people. this is especially true for ailments that affect people mentally which i think it s safe to say that addiction falls under that same umbrella. people deal with various addictions in different ways, why aa treats alcohol as a one size fits all approach i can t say, maybe i m wrong, but based on the text of their twelve steps and twelve promises that doesn t seem to be the case. instead they seem to say that the only reason people fail is because the fail to give themselves over fully to the program which seems to be very very odd.","Alcoholics Anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasn't tried to improve it's system since it's inception : i have a friend who has been attending aa meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a dui for the record i don't know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or 'choose' jailtime and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not aa works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program. below i've listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner. this means that i m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change. 1. we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable. 2. came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understoodhim. 4. made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. admitted to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character. 7. humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings. 8. made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. sought through prayer and mation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. 12. my current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30 s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases. here are some of my thoughts on the matter. first up, as many have pointed out, there's a whole lot of god involved throughout the 12 steps 6 direct references and 7 if you count 2 , i'm not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend. if a person does not believe in god they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety. if alcoholism is a disease then why does aa treat it simply as a matter of will power?

 Laissez Faire is the ideal Governmental/Societal Structure,"as morality cannot be imposed, and the smart, or selfish, or rich will always have advantage any system, however vetted, will produce unintended consequences. the more complex the regulation or system, the harder it is to evaluate the success. welfare, government oversight, banking and industry regulation, healthcare and similar policies inevitably fail to produce better results than the self correcting selfish incentives of competition. for example: the recent fiduciary rule attempted to standardize compensation for advisory services on asset management. this was meant to be a more strict policy compared to a disclosure based, potentially conflicted, model in which suitability was the standard. the problem which was attempted to be addressed was: broker has fund a and b which are both suitable, but picks a for revenue purposes. the solution was, fund a and b must pay the same. simply put . the reality was that the industry broadly increased fees holistically, to maintain revenue levels but collect it another way. average fees went up. in the chaos of the administration change, the standard was ultimately struck down. it seems to me, that ultimately, people learn from experience, and in the learning process even systemically, many problems self correct from individual incentive. a social darwinism of behavior, as evolution has shown us the impact of selective competitive advantage with iteration, why can that not apply also to society? us spending on welfare is comparatively high compared to international spending on a proportional decrease in standardized poverty levels can t vote on my phone directly, but a 2012 study was referenced on wikipedia s welfare page . my view could change with appropriate statistical evidence. it seems most of the research on these concepts are highly partisan, and the results are hard to take at face value. to be honest my current view is how i was educated. i would appreciate a differing, well supported viewpoint."," Laissez Faire is the ideal Governmental/Societal Structure : as morality cannot be imposed, and the smart, or selfish, or rich will always have advantage any system, however vetted, will produce unintended consequences. the more complex the regulation or system, the harder it is to evaluate the success. welfare, government oversight, banking and industry regulation, healthcare and similar policies inevitably fail to produce better results than the self correcting selfish incentives of competition. for example: the recent fiduciary rule attempted to standardize compensation for advisory services on asset management. this was meant to be a more strict policy compared to a disclosure based, potentially conflicted, model in which suitability was the standard. the problem which was attempted to be addressed was: broker has fund a and b which are both suitable, but picks a for revenue purposes. the solution was, fund a and b must pay the same. simply put . the reality was that the industry broadly increased fees holistically, to maintain revenue levels but collect it another way. average fees went up. in the chaos of the administration change, the standard was ultimately struck down. it seems to me, that ultimately, people learn from experience, and in the learning process even systemically, many problems self correct from individual incentive. a social darwinism of behavior, as evolution has shown us the impact of selective competitive advantage with iteration, why can that not apply also to society? us spending on welfare is comparatively high compared to international spending on a proportional decrease in standardized poverty levels can t vote on my phone directly, but a 2012 study was referenced on wikipedia s welfare page . my view could change with appropriate statistical evidence. it seems most of the research on these concepts are highly partisan, and the results are hard to take at face value. to be honest my current view is how i was educated. i would appreciate a differing, well supported viewpoint.","so you want to return to a laissez faire form of food safety for example? won't that have adverse outcomes for people with allergies, it every just salmonella eggs?",the problem with your view is that it assumes that everyone has the same moral code. that's not the case. the problem is that you assume that everyone's moral code is the same. it's not.,"the problem with laissez faire is that it assumes that everyone has the same set of skills and abilities. the problem with this is that there is no such thing as a 'fair' system. if you want to have a fair system, you have to have the same level of skill and abilities as everyone else. you can't have a perfect system, but you can have a faire system."
 There is nothing wrong with the encouraging/ reinforcment of masculinity.,"i often see people criticizing phrases such as 'man up! ,' 'be a man! ,' etc, and claiming these are bad for young people men and women to hear. historically and biologically, men have been and are more combative than women so if a woman needs to be combative to accomplish something, i see no problem is saying 'be a man.

 Rap is lower quality music and is overrated.,"before i get into this, let me be clear what i'm not trying to say : all rap is bad. rap takes no talent. people shouldn't listen to rap at all. people who listen to rap are less intellegent. all the problems i list are exclusive to rap and not other genres of music. ok, now let's get into this : 1. rap uses less people to create, which does not always indicate, but usually indicates less effort overall . obviously, the more people working on something, the more hours that can be put into something. that doesn't mean one person can't create something good, but the likelihood of an individual creating something good is statically less than that of a group. 2. most rap songs use rhymes, which can alter what the creator wants the song to mean . the creator of a song might want to portray a message, express an emotion s , or cause the listener to critically think in some way. since many rap songs rely heavily on rhyming their lyrics, they have to alter the words of the songs in order to rhyme. while this can be entertaining, the meaning of the song is often lost, misunderstood or not taken seriously. 3. rap relies too heavily on vocals and not a variety of instruments . that's not to say that rap never uses anything else, but vocals are always at the forefront; everything but the vocals is just background noise, vocals are emphasized. this means that rap as a genre lacks variety within artists and between artists. it becomes more difficult to distinguish between rap songs, and they start to blend together. this begins to ruin the perception of what's good and what's bad. on top of that, if the vocals are bad, the whole song is bad vs. if one instrument were bad, the entire song is not necessarily ruined. 4. rap is easier to learn than other genres that use other instruments, and most anyone can do it if try tried. there's no hand eye coordination with vocals as with a guitar or piano. on top of that, traditional vocals require the singer to use certain pitches consistently and at loud capacities and to a beat. this makes it easier to learn than other interments or vocals. meaning, people without natural talent can start rapping, and lesser quality songs can be made in abundance. of course, a rapper can spend an equal or greater amount of time practicing as any other musician. but remember, people can also get really good at sitting down and standing up, that doesn't equate to quality. i try to be objective, but i obviously wouldn't be making this argument if i didn't have a bias. i do enjoy some rap, i'm not completely adverse to it. other genres have similar problems, i would say the same of a lot of pop or country music. let me know what you guys think, am i way off base?

 The method of punishment should change,"'whatever undeserved evil you inflict upon another within the people, you inflict upon yourself' kant murderers should be murdered, exactly how they committed the murder. killed someone by throwing rocks at them? death by stoning. killed by shooting? criminal should be shot. thieves should lose all their property, rapists should be raped. this may be an extreme form of justice, but i believe it is one of the only just system. you see completely sick, sadistic cruel people, that only get punished by being behind bars?

are they dead or alive? the answer is that they are more alive, because human life is a continuum. but still barely alive. the legal system treats life as binary, not because this reflects reality, but because practically , it would be impossible to run a legal system where life was expressed in terms of percentages. it would also have some nasty side effects. living in a society where you constantly have to prove the degree of your aliveness in order to gain protections would be a terrifying experience for most people. in short, binary life is a legal fiction, but a useful legal fiction. but once we have acknowledged this we also have to acknowledge that we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, and that where exactly we draw that line is arbitrary. however, we can use biology to give us a meaningful ballpark . drawing the line at conception is silly from a biological perspective, because we know that a person's 'essence' resides in the brain, and the brain doesn't develop until later.",i don't think it's fair to say that a fetus is a part of the mother's body. it's not like the mother has a right to control her own body. i think it is fair to assume that the mother doesn't have the right to kill a fetus because they re inconvenient to the mother.,"i don't know if i can change your view, but i'm going to try to change your mind. i'm not sure what you mean by 'human life'. i think it's important to distinguish between a human life and a fetus. a fetus is not a person, it's a person. it's not a human being. it is a person who has a right to life, and a person that has the right to bodily autonomy. i don't think that's a"

violent crime. blacks and latinos are over represented in violent crime despite being small percentages of the population. likewise, whites and especially asians are not as represented or averagely so. iq and success income are highly correlated, which would explain why asians perform better than whites who perform better than latinos who perform better than blacks. we have thrown billions of dollars into an educated system to combat the black white test score gap that will never be solved because american blacks simply lack the cognitive ability. the same would be said for asians and whites. there isn t one county in the united states where blacks outperform whites. i don t understand this liberal belief that race is made up or a social construct just looking at an east asian vs a

 Sex before marriage is to be avoided. Marriage is good (especially if you want to raise children).

' instead, both partners should engage in these activities when they both feel that they are ready for them. they should get married when they're both confident that this is the partner they want to spend the rest of their lives with. to me, a wedding is simply an opportunity to celebrate that love commitment you've created with friends and family. ultimately, marriage is a long term relationship that needs to be worked on and managed forever. it's not like you get married and start with a new relationship or you get married and all the relationship work vanishes. instead, you get married and a week later things should go back to being how they were before the stress of the wedding.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'legal marriage'. if you mean a legal marriage, then i think you're right. however, i think it's important to note that legal marriage is not the only way to get married. if you want to have children, then you need to be married to someone who is willing to take care of you.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'legal marriage is pragmatic.'if you mean'marriage is to be avoided', then i don't see how that would be a good thing."

' these rules are: 1. graduate high school doesn't have to be a good high school 2. get and hold a job doesn't have to be a good job 3. don't have kids until 21 or later and we might add 'don't have kids out of wedlock, given what we just examined, and brookings touches on this subject, too these things are all quite manageable. the state will pay for your high school education, all you have to do is show up. unemployment is quite low at under 4 . and if you're poor, not having kids seems like a pretty obviously good life decision. a single kid takes roughly a quarter of a million dollars to raise from 0 18 in the us. i used to be poor as shit and fairly uneducated, but even back then i knew that my life prospects wouldn't be helped out much by entering into a 18 year, 250,000 lease for an aston martin vanquish s volante and then a couple years later entering another lease agreement for an equally expensive ferrari 488. if i did that, i'd expect you to think i was rather stupid, not ply me with sympathy for my financial problems. and yet that's basically what people who have kids when they're too poor to reasonably support just themselves are doing. anyways, brookings found that for lower class people who just followed these three simple rules, 75 joined the middle class, 23 at least improved their class financial prospects, and only 2 made no class financial progress at all. so if poor black youth or poor youth of any demographic just graduate high school, get and hold a job, and don't have kids until after they're 21 and or married, there's a 98 chance they'll either rise out of poverty or at least improve their status. and again, these are things that are your own personal decisions, not the result of outside influences acting against you. you can't blame the war on drugs or police brutality for your lack of upward mobility when there's three simple things that you can do for and by yourself to gain that upward mobility. veneration of gang poverty culture and the victim complex the first part of this two parter is the hardest for me to quantify with statistics, and perhaps my weakest argument, but it's something i've noticed on a widespread anecdotal scale and felt was worth mentioning. what i've noticed is that poorer people often seem to take a kind of pride in their impoverished status. and look, i get it. i've been poor and homeless and have done some very bad things in the interest of making money that i'd detail here if so many of them weren't federal crimes. but that lifestyle only really has a few possible outcomes: you either get out of it and go straight, you end up dead, you end up in jail, or, and this is what everyone is shooting for, you become that 0. 001 of criminals that makes it big and lives in a mansion with lots of beautiful women, pet tigers on the lawn, tons of cash, and diamond studded everything. and it's that last outcome that i see being often aspired to when young, poor kids get involved in criminal behavior. but that's as foolish as banking on your garage band becoming as big as the next metallica except when your garage band goes bunk you just go your separate ways with some musical skills under your belt; you don't end up dead or incarcerated. the second part is a bigger deal, i think: the victim complex. some of your plight is the fault of your oppressors, true, but if you behave like all of it is their fault then why bother trying to improve your prospects? black publications as well as black leaders like jesse lee peterson, thomas sowell, larry elder, and the youtuber some black guy, among others, have all pointed out that this 'woe unto me' victim complex isn't doing the black community any favors if the goal is to improve the status of the black community in america. black criminality i know, i know, controversial phrasing. most crime is intraracial. and i know the predictable comeback will be: 'but u chadonsunday, they're poor and destitute and oppressed crime is their only option!

 there is a relative lack of respect and deference for the social sciences.,"we have a worldwide network of universities with countless sociology, anthropology, political science and critical theory departments, yet it seems like every ordinary person off the street feels equally qualified to speculate or offer opinions about human nature, culture, politics, etc. you just don't see the natural sciences treated the same way. if someone has an interesting thought pop into their head about biology or physics, they don't just assume that thought in its current state is equivalent to research. the curiosity that gets sparked about natural science always seems to lead to a google search, at least. it certainly doesn't seem like it to me. it seems that the most people are willing to do is shop around for statistical studies that support a position they have already determined all on their own to be correct. i totally understand why this is the case. when it comes to social science, everyone seems to believe that we all have access to the same data; we are all human, and we all have experienced belonging to a society. we also have a natural tendency to try to universalize our particular perspective. i think there is a very strong temptation to do this for the sake of our own ego nobody wants to be the villain, everybody wants to be the hero. i just think that it is interesting how rarely people realize that there are legions of professionals out there who do nothing but read, write and think about the topics that they have chewed over during the margins of their day. but what's even worse is how this ignorance carries itself into our social discourse. right now there is a serious accusation of partiality and bias against politically conservative students and faculty in university social science departments. the reason for this is really quite simple: objectivity requires detachment from the subject being studied, and this detachment leads to criticism of normative beliefs and institutions that are currently in power. given that the conservative position is all about maintaining the status quo against external threats, or even returning to an ideological vision of the past when these institutions were supposedly even stronger, conservatives are obviously going to feel particularly attacked by the process of critique. conversely, liberals leftists are going to embrace the results of objective critique and become political advocates for reform. any idea, be it politically conservative or liberal, can have its place if it actually holds up to disciplinary rigor. one example is the youtube personality 'sargon of akkad' aka carl benjamin a guy who invokes classical liberalism to attack feminists and other identity groups, even though he has never critically studied political philosophy beyond what provides him with convenient arguments to rile up his viewers. another even more insidious example is jordan peterson a psychologist !

 Transgender rights is a low priority issue and the left should divert its political capital elsewhere for now,"first off i think there are issues that dwarf it in importance. you're not going to be able to get your transition meds if you can't afford healthcare. is your gender identity really going to matter much when climate change hits in full swing? you're not going to be able to be your true gender if you're in working poverty. will getting more trans people into politics matter much if they're up against vast amounts of corporate , running in gerrymandered districts, with their votes counted on diebold voting machines without a paper trail? i know it's possible to focus on more than one issue at a time. it only concerns a very small of the population. mtf and ftm are a tiny , and other gender concepts even smaller still. it's so rare that people won't see themselves in transgender people, or will find it very easy not to and to 'other' them instead. 2. it can be seen to contradict prior progressive ways of thinking, like 'gender doesn't matter' and 'don't judge a book by its cover'. people who have strained themselves to accept that girls can do all the things boys can, will now have to strain themselves all over again, and won't take kindly to ending up in the 'bigot' category. 3. it relies on relatively recent and advanced concepts in the humanities and medical science that are beyond the understanding of a majority of the population. one key scientific claim behind the movement is that men and women have different brains and transgender brains correspond with their identified gender; this is the subject of scientific debate this is in a society where things like evolution and climate change still get debated. 4. it isn't a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights as it asks the rest of the population to change their behaviour, and tells them that not only the things they say, but the way they think is wrong. they may be minor things like 'state your name and pronouns' at events, or needing to tiptoe around things that could once be assumed to be gender specific like pregnancy and mensturation, or referring to a person you met as 'they' in very strained sentences. the issue arises when people have to 'educate themselves' and 'get with the program'. people who feel frustrated by 'political correctness' are a very rich vein for politicians to tap into. it pays to be the politician telling you that your subconscious is right; that the masculine looking person in a dress is what you think they are and not what you've been told they are. 5. there are aspects of it that are quite frankly offensive to the average persons sensibilities. concepts like 'uncanny valley' are real things, and pictures and videos of normal parts of transgender life are nsfl. this can change over time, but it's a very slow process consider how long it took for something as benign as gay kissing to make it to mainstream tv and cinema . this would be fine, except 6. it combines those things with children. many people are far more conservative when it comes to children than they are with society is general. you may be ok with adults doing what they want to themselves but draw the line at children, because that's something parents are enabling, and to top it all off many of the things are irreversible. on top of that, the rapid rise of people's awareness of this issue will make people think 'fad'. once you get to this nexus, it can turn a disagreement into a crusade. there are many more issues;

we should let people get comfortable with more gender conforming trans people that fit into cis society without requiring many changes, before we unleash the ey em genderfluid pansexual anarchocommunist demigirls i make fun of you 'cause i love you! . a few examples of strategies i'd like to see in the movement: redefine gender as something along the lines of 'if your birth certificate and sex hormones agree on one of 'male' or 'female', that is your gender. if not, you may self identify as either gender, and use the faculties of either gender, but may not participate in women's sports. ' this is, as the trump administration would say, 'grounded in science', while also being trans inclusive, and making at least some sense. it cedes some ground to the conservatives, while not really negatively affecting very many people's lives. i think it's a bad final definition for a variety of reasons, but i think it makes a decent starting point that is resistant to the conservative bogeyman of the weird creepy man that starts wearing a dress one day so he can use the women's room. i think that conservatives are imagining trans women as 'men in dresses' and trans men as 'women with buzzcuts'. so maybe we should make the image of trans people less 'weird androgynous in between folks' and more 'people who are basically the same as everyone else but changed their gender'. this is an example of something i'd like to see more of. we really have to stop minimizing people's concerns with the really thorny parts of the trans movement, like women's prisons, or women's sports. i think there are reasonable objections that we should take into account and think about , not just assume everyone raising them is a transphobic asshole. i am sure there are really good potential compromises on this stuff, but if we create a moratorium on anything that even kind of looks like transphobia from a distance, we're really hamstringing ourselves and there's no way we'll be able to find an effective solution that people are okay with.","i don't think it's a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights, but i think it is a very rich vein for politicians to tap into.","i don't think it's a 'live and let live' issue like gay rights as it asks the rest of the population to change their behaviour, and tells them that not only the things they say but the way they do are likely to end up in the 'bigot' category."

 Bush was worse than Trump,"note: we're talking bush jr. here. please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post."," Bush was worse than Trump : note: we're talking bush jr. here. please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.","so i'm a big fan of bush. i like him a lot and would have made basically every decision that he did had i been in his place. so you can take this with a grain of salt, or just write me off as being a monster. what would bill clinton have done had he gotten 4 terms? the first months of the bush presidency were taken up with the popping of the tech bubble. in retrospect it wasn't that big of a deal and certainly got over shadowed by other events, but at the time it was a big deal and demanded a huge amount of time dealing with the economic and social impacts. which means i don't think any reasonable president acting without advanced knowledge could have avoided 9 11. would you agree with me on that? now if you accept that 9 11 has happened, i am also going to propose to you that the invasion of afghanistan was also unavoidable. even if you had perfect knowledge of what would happen there, any president would have be compelled to invade afghanistan. lets then talk about iraq. post 9 11 the usa quickly realized that the status quo in the middle east was not acceptable to it. people chanting 'death to america' in the streets was going to eventually lead to attacks. philosophically it became clear that america couldn't simply wall itself off from the rest of the world but instead needed to get involved more directly. so we had a list of hot spots. russia, iran, iraq, north korea, saudi arabia, and 'palestine' that were the major issues. bush put a lot of diplomatic effort into russia and thought he had developed a good working relationship with putin. he read putin wrong. but someone had to. someone had to give putin the chance to play the good guy and let him make the active choice to instead play the bad guy. bush took the hit on that. but look at hrc at state and the reset button. they tried again, and failed again, so it isn't as though bush's actions here were unreasonable. if anything bush was ahead of the curve figuring out who putin was. north korea bush engaged in some pretty successful diplomacy and definately got the pot down to a simmer there. it was obama who allowed the heat to be reapplied. on the saudi arabia front the kingdom basically got on a path towards reform and has been making little steps along it ever since and while its still a shit show and a lot of crgoes to obama for continuing the good work and building on it , its better than iran or iraq so that's some kind of win right? so bush was left with iraq and iran. historic enemies of each other, both enemies of america, and both actively funding terrorists and interesting in wmd's. iraq however was giving good cause for war. they were violating the terms of the first gulf war's end by frustrating the work of weapon's inspectors this was a deliberate policy of saddam so that other players in the region would think he had wmd's available to him . they were firing on us warplanes patroling the no fly zone on a regular basis this is independently a near weekly act of war against the united states . they were funding terrorism in israel and around the world openly paying the families of dead terrorists for successful attacks . and so they were invaded. the decision was put to congress, and virtually every democratic senator and congressman voted in favor of it. would clinton have done otherwise had he been in office? i doubt it. it was, to a certain extent, a war of choice. however post 9 11 saddam's course of conduct was no longer acceptable to america. clinton might have tried deeper negotiations or pushed for more sanctions, but that would have sent a weaker message to iran. furthermore there was good reason to think, at the time, iraq was going to be a relative cake walk. or at least much less of a mess than it turned into. so i don't know if you can really say that clinton wouldn't have done exactly what bush did there. the one thought i will leave you with. the sanctions applied on iraq didn't personally hurt saddam. he had his lifestyle and if ten thousand children a month had to starve to death so that he could throw a lavish party using the food that would have saved them he threw the party. hundreds of thousands of people were dying in iraq yearly due to the sanctions we imposed. imagine we were 15 years later and the sanctions were still in place. who's the mass murderer now?",i'm not sure what you mean by bush jr.,"trump is worse than bush in many quantifiable ways, that may or may not have more lasting effects on our country tbh. but weighing them all against each other as best we can, at the point in his presidency trump has not been as net a negative for the world as bush was. bush achieved true war criminal status and the multitude of deaths that come with that, but he's too dumb to get any of it accomplished."

 Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication.,"my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable."," Children ought never to be put on psychiatric medication. : my main argument is this: children, physiologically speaking, have not reached maturity. duh. no one disagrees with this. their brains, bodies, emotions and basically everything about them is not mature. a child can display both acceptable and unacceptable behavior at any given time. when the behavior is deemed unacceptable and persistently so, this is when psychiatrists are called upon. this is bad news for the child. since children have not reached puberty, no less their formative years, their enduring personality along with their body, brain and character have only just begun to develop into what in the future can become a stable, integrated self. studies have shown the potential of stultification of children, stunting their growth after prolonged usage of adhd related drugs. interfering chemically with a brain not yet matured must then be seen as having the potential for tremendous, far reaching negative consequences. the idea i am challenging is believing a child and their bad or aberrant behavior necessarily equates to a brain based biological chemical imbalance and or disease process needing the treatment of a psychiatrist who will administer powerful brain and mind altering psychotropic chemicals to a still developing brain. that psychiatric medications certainly alter brain chemistry in anyone taking them is indisputable.","i think this decision should be left to doctors who study thousands of patients for years to determine what works and what doesn t. it should be left to their skilled opinions, not a layman s debate. doctor s wouldn t prescribe medicines that hurt unless the benefits outweighed the consequences.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i think it's important to note that adhd is not a mental illness. it's a mental disorder that can be treated with medication, but it's not a disease.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to note that there are a lot of different types of mental disorders. for example, adhd is a mental disorder that affects the development of the brain, but it's not a mental illness. it's a neurological disorder that can be treated with medication, and it can also be treated through therapy. for instance, if a child is diagnosed with adhd, they can be put on psychotropic medication"

 Meaningful forgiveness can only be given upon request.,"i've heard many times that people should forgive those who wrong them in order to move on and be at peace. that doesn't seem right or useful to me. in such situations the wronged party essentially excuses their offender's behavior even when it doesn't necessarily deserve to be, and perpetuates that behavior. a good example might be a case where a person is raped is decides to forgive their attacker instead of seeking justice; the rapist is free to continue their attacks with their actions uncontested and without remorse. i'm no psychologist but it further seems like doing so may risk the victim's feeling of self worth deteriorating."," Meaningful forgiveness can only be given upon request. : i've heard many times that people should forgive those who wrong them in order to move on and be at peace. that doesn't seem right or useful to me. in such situations the wronged party essentially excuses their offender's behavior even when it doesn't necessarily deserve to be, and perpetuates that behavior. a good example might be a case where a person is raped is decides to forgive their attacker instead of seeking justice; the rapist is free to continue their attacks with their actions uncontested and without remorse. i'm no psychologist but it further seems like doing so may risk the victim's feeling of self worth deteriorating.",when a victim gives forgiveness it's not them saying it's okay to do awful things it's about closure on their end. that they need to move on and the only way to let the hurt and anger go is to forgive.,"i don't think it's a good idea to forgive someone for something they didn't do. i think it is a good thing to forgive people for things they did wrong, but it's not the same thing as forgiving someone for things you did wrong.","i'm not sure what you mean by'meaningful forgiveness', but i think it's important to remember that forgiveness is not the only thing that can be given. for example, if a person is raped, it's not the fault of the rapist, but of the victim. if the rapist was raped, the victim would have been able to move on and be at peace. but if the victim was raped again, it would be the victim's fault, not the rapist's."

" There's no problem with minority representation in media, and so, established characters should not have major traits about their character changed, such as race.","to my disappointment, it seems we might be on the verge of having a black james bond. james bond has always been white, just how blade has always been black. but i expect there might be some outrage if blade suddenly became white. so why is it okay to make white characters black?

 I think the Internet could eventually replace universities,"universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university? can disciplinary knowledge also become social knowledge that is freely accessed, produced and disseminated by literally anyone that might choose to participate? for this to be possible, i think we would need to see a couple big changes take place. first and foremost, we would need a sort of second wave enlightenment which would throw out the current paradigm of alternative facts and insulated echo chambers of information. society as a whole would need to accept a common sense of objectivity and rationality, such that it is able to uphold its own standards of legitimacy. bad faith research and education would need to be quickly marginalized; but we would also need to be willing to accept innovation and new ideas, as long as they meet the standards of our collective scrutiny. secondly, we would need to see some sort of system of compensation that would fund research and education as goods in themselves . as it currently stands, this is the biggest issue in higher education and research. during his presidency, reagan criticized the disciplinary knowledge produced by university researchers, claiming that they were merely satisfying personal curiosity about obscure or useless issues, and using this criticism to justify a massive defunding of higher education. the legacy of this defunding has been the increase in student tuition and debt, an increased presence of private businesses on university campuses, a new focus on collegiate athletics and recreation to attract students, the co opting of research by private interests, etc. research and education have been re cast as means to capitalist ends; research to provide technological innovations to industry, education to equip laborers with knowledge and or general capabilities needed for workplace success. for the internet to become the new medium for research and education, we would need to somehow return to a social paradigm where knowledge itself is a valid end to pursue, and education is inherently enriching , and these goods are willingly funded by society without some expectation of an economic return. can we reach this point in our future? i would speculate that we can for a couple reasons. there will come a tipping point where the continuous expansion of higher education devalues the degree such that it is no longer economically feasible to pursue. secondly, while much of what we see happening on the internet is not encouraging, there are still some bright spots, and there is still the fact that the internet is very young. we have future generations that will grow up not even knowing a time before the internet existed; we can hope that these new immersed generations will make better use of the internet as a medium for research and education. we can hope that these younger generations will react against the uncertainty and relativism of our current generations, and bring about this second wave enlightenment that would need to take place. change my view."," I think the Internet could eventually replace universities : universities as institutions serve a variety of purposes, but first and foremost they provide a social structure that produces and passes along knowledge in a manner that is verified and trustworthy. universities create standards for knowledge and education by establishing disciplines with standardized methodologies and accepted practices, but they also encourage and award innovation as long as new ideas and methods can be properly explicated. disciplines change, and academic professionals are rewarded for changing their disciplines, as long as their ideas can actually hold up to the level of rational scrutiny that is promoted within these institutions. similarly, the standards of the discipline are exercised to evaluate students, and this evaluation is what gives the university degree its value in the labor market. my question is basically this: can the internet develop to the point where it can establish this sort of standardized disciplinary knowledge independent of the institutional structure of the university?

" ""Fat Shaming"" shouldn't be treated as actual discrimination","so in recent years, there has been a greater concern from the general american public about how we treat those who are overweight or obese. many such as those in the fat acceptance movement and other such groups have began to argue that things like pointing out someone's weight, making fun of someone's weight, and certain portrayals of overweight people in media are all something called 'fat shaming. ' criticisms of one's weight are not serious forms of discrimination especially if said criticisms are not mean spirited in nature because unlike things such as race, gender, etc, you can change your weight. they are suggesting their unhealthy lifestyle is not the problem but, rather, the problem is lack of accommodations and society's view of your lifestyle. this view undermines the serious health risks of obesity, something which has currently reached epidemic proportion in the united states. perhaps i have the wrong idea about what these people are saying. i'd love to hear the other side of this argument."," ""Fat Shaming"" shouldn't be treated as actual discrimination : so in recent years, there has been a greater concern from the general american public about how we treat those who are overweight or obese. many such as those in the fat acceptance movement and other such groups have began to argue that things like pointing out someone's weight, making fun of someone's weight, and certain portrayals of overweight people in media are all something called 'fat shaming.

 Your vote in the US presidential election should not be informed by the candidate's likelihood of winning (specifically as it applies to 3rd party candidates or write-ins),"as an additional caveat, i should say that one of my biggest concerns in posting this is that i will simply encounter an echo chamber. my suspicion is that my views are likely held by most of reddit. but posting this is at least in part an attempt at catharsis: i've had these conversations in real life with so many people, and i inevitably run into what i perceive to be cognitive dissonance in the person i'm speaking with. there are at least a few nuances to the argument i'm putting forth that may strike at least somewhat of a nerve with the reddit community, so here goes. they strongly disliked trump, and justified their decision as 'voting for the lesser of two evils.

" When fighting terrorists like ISIS, we should toss aside 'moral' warfare for effective warfare.","since 2011 or so, isis has been raising syria to the ground, the syrian civil war has only helped them maintain their control, but although they are losing ground now, several years after they had enstated their 'state', they still hold considerable territory, and still hold major population centres in many area's of the country. isis have clearly shown themselves to be savage, barbaric and lacking with any sense of human empathy, in area's where we have driven them away we have found nothing but piles of corpses and mass graves as a symbol of their atrocities. they have captured ethnic minorities, and slaughtered them with an unremorseful stature. they have captured our own men and women, and tortured them in the most gruesome ways, before usually executing them. there are many area's in syria where city sieges have been gruesome and pyrrhic at best. the cities we enter when isis have eventually been driven out leave the exact same situation that they begun at, instead this time, the people slowly died from starvation, disease and dehydration, which is a horrible way for anyone to die. in my opinion, if a town city is of no major importance to the nation, and would be better out of enemy hands than in theirs, would it not be more ethically considerable to initiate a tactical nuclear strike? after all, it would most likely kill everyone within the vicinity instantly, and its not like the cities are going to be reused after the war ends, in most other major cities recaptured in syria, the buildings are beyond repair due to months if not years of shelling, laser guiding bombings and heavy armaments fire, so the buildings are going to be demolished anyway. how can we claim to have the moral high ground when we shell cities and cause immense human suffering simply because we lack the 'morality' to end their lives quickly? the civilians in these cities will die a slow, painful and debilitating death because we carry out yearly sieges on cities, why not end their suffering quickly? a tactical nuclear strike against a city that is not important would kill all the isis insurgents, but also bring peace to any civilians, who would no longer have to suffer. i am not saying use nuclear weapons in all circumstances, i am saying if it is more efficient and will kill less people than a city siege, and more often than not, that will be the case. city seiges simply starve out the inhabitants, only for us to enter the population area's to find a funeral spire, that we ended up creating through out 'morality' tactics. in history, no major war has taken place with the premise of 'morality' being taken seriously, look at world war 1, gas was actively used, because it was effective. look at ww2, we bombed cities and factories, without consideration for the population than lived or worked there, because ultimately, it would stop the tide of an ideology that would ruin our way of life."," When fighting terrorists like ISIS, we should toss aside 'moral' warfare for effective warfare. : since 2011 or so, isis has been raising syria to the ground, the syrian civil war has only helped them maintain their control, but although they are losing ground now, several years after they had enstated their 'state', they still hold considerable territory, and still hold major population centres in many area's of the country. isis have clearly shown themselves to be savage, barbaric and lacking with any sense of human empathy, in area's where we have driven them away we have found nothing but piles of corpses and mass graves as a symbol of their atrocities. they have captured ethnic minorities, and slaughtered them with an unremorseful stature. they have captured our own men and women, and tortured them in the most gruesome ways, before usually executing them. there are many area's in syria where city sieges have been gruesome and pyrrhic at best. the cities we enter when isis have eventually been driven out leave the exact same situation that they begun at, instead this time, the people slowly died from starvation, disease and dehydration, which is a horrible way for anyone to die. in my opinion, if a town city is of no major importance to the nation, and would be better out of enemy hands than in theirs, would it not be more ethically considerable to initiate a tactical nuclear strike?

 Dogs Are Better For Defending Your Home Than A Gun,"so, i'm a big fan of the second amendment, former military, experienced and trained in how to handle a firearm. i really enjoy the hobby of shooting, and spend a lot of time around like minded gun folks. because of this, i truly believe that many american's stated reason for owning a gun, home defense self defense, is absurd. a lot of my friends have described the 'self defense fantasy' wherein they heroically grab their gun and blow about the bad guys who break into their house in the middle of the night. i spent a year in iraq on qrf, sleeping with my rifle and a 30 round mag next to my head, and i know that i'm utterly useless for the first few minutes after i wake up. the idea that i could be awoken, armed, and thinking straight is already a lot to ask of me the guy with the military training . especially because adrenaline will almost certainly be flowing, and adrenaline makes you stupid, very stupid. don't believe me? try a shoot don't shoot course. see what you shoot. 2 laws for self defense typically don't let you go about shooting people, even in your own home. afaik the only state that lets you shoot somebody to defend your property is texas. it doesn't matter how much your tv is worth, in 49 states it's against the law to shoot somebody for taking it. furthermore, in many states, you have a duty to retreat, meaning that you must only use lethal force if you're cornered and have no other option. in other words, if you shoot somebody in your house, you might very well wind up on trial. 3 the chance of hitting the wrong person is non zero, and therefore needs to be considered. ricochets are weird, and once you pull that trigger there's a good chance the slug will wind up somewhere you hadn't thought of. especially when you're hopped up adrenaline and shooting in a dark room at night. 4 keeping a 'self defense ready' firearm ie accessible from your bedroom, with a round in the chamber or a mag within reach is a real hazard. i personally don't trust drunk me near a gun, because drunk me is an idiot. when i lived with my parents, i got the scare of my life when i found my 14 year old brother playing with my ak one day. it doesn't matter how secure your lock is, or how well you think you hid it, the people that live with you know how to get in there, and know where it is. 5 in many cases, calling 9 1 1 and barricading your door is going to do a better job of protecting you. the police officers who are awake, unlike you have legal authority to shoot, and will be be better equipped to deal with the bad guy. i realize this may not apply if you live in a super rural area where 9 1 1 could take 20 minutes to get a cop to you, but the overwhelming majority of americans don't live on a wilderness preserve in alaska. compare this to a dog. for the purposes of this cmv, i'm assuming a housebroken dog of at least a somewhat large breed, although not necessarily a mastiff or something huge. 1 your dog will absolutely hear somebody messing with your door in the middle of the night. your dog will also make it abundantly clear to that person that they've been detected, which may be enough to convince a would be home invader to try another house. they're ready to roll as soon as they spring awake, even if it's just going into a barking fit, during which time you can call 9 1 1. all of this happens without you having to go to the range on a regular basis to practice shooting. 2 laws about a dog biting somebody on your property vary wildly, but they generally don't treat it as harshly as shooting somebody on your property. this is also, of course, assuming your dog bites somebody, which they might not do, they might just go into a barking fit, which still served a valuable purpose. 3 in my experience, dogs know who should and shouldn't be in the house and react accordingly once they've identified you. even when i used to come home from the bar at 1am trying to sneak in so my wife doesn't yell at me, my dogs recognized me as soon as they're close enough to smell me. but not before they woke up the whole house to announce

unsocialized asshole dog inevitably does get loose. what would change my view would be something that really refutes any of my above points, especially if you can show me statistics proving a gun is a more reliable for of defense than a dog. or if you can show me some legal precedent that a dog used for self defense is at least as legally precarious as shooting a gun at a home invader."," Dogs Are Better For Defending Your Home Than A Gun : so, i'm a big fan of the second amendment, former military, experienced and trained in how to handle a firearm. i really enjoy the hobby of shooting, and spend a lot of time around like minded gun folks. because of this, i truly believe that many american's stated reason for owning a gun, home defense self defense, is absurd. a lot of my friends have described the 'self defense fantasy' wherein they heroically grab their gun and blow about the bad guys who break into their house in the middle of the night. i spent a year in iraq on qrf, sleeping with my rifle and a 30 round mag next to my head, and i know that i'm utterly useless for the first few minutes after i wake up. the idea that i could be awoken, armed, and thinking straight is already a lot to ask of me the guy with the military training . especially because adrenaline will almost certainly be flowing, and adrenaline makes you stupid, very stupid. don't believe me? try a shoot don't shoot course. see what you shoot. 2 laws for self defense typically don't let you go about shooting people, even in your own home. afaik the only state that lets you shoot somebody to defend your property is texas. it doesn't matter how much your tv is worth, in 49 states it's against the law to shoot somebody for taking it. furthermore, in many states, you have a duty to retreat, meaning that you must only use lethal force if you're cornered and have no other option. in other words, if you shoot somebody in your house, you might very well wind up on trial. 3 the chance of hitting the wrong person is non zero, and therefore needs to be considered. ricochets are weird, and once you pull that trigger there's a good chance the slug will wind up somewhere you hadn't thought of. especially when you're hopped up adrenaline and shooting in a dark room at night. 4 keeping a 'self defense ready' firearm ie accessible from your bedroom, with a round in the chamber or a mag within reach is a real hazard. i personally don't trust drunk me near a gun, because drunk me is an idiot. when i lived with my parents, i got the scare of my life when i found my 14 year old brother playing with my ak one day. it doesn't matter how secure your lock is, or how well you think you hid it, the people that live with you know how to get in there, and know where it is. 5 in many cases, calling 9 1 1 and barricading your door is going to do a better job of protecting you. the police officers who are awake, unlike you have legal authority to shoot, and will be be better equipped to deal with the bad guy. i realize this may not apply if you live in a super rural area where 9 1 1 could take 20 minutes to get a cop to you, but the overwhelming majority of americans don't live on a wilderness preserve in alaska. compare this to a dog. for the purposes of this cmv, i'm assuming a housebroken dog of at least a somewhat large breed, although not necessarily a mastiff or something huge. 1 your dog will absolutely hear somebody messing with your door in the middle of the night. your dog will also make it abundantly clear to that person that they've been detected, which may be enough to convince a would be home invader to try another house. they're ready to roll as soon as they spring awake, even if it's just going into a barking fit, during which time you can call 9 1 1. all of this happens without you having to go to the range on a regular basis to practice shooting. 2 laws about a dog biting somebody on your property vary wildly, but they generally don't treat it as harshly as shooting somebody on your property. this is also, of course, assuming your dog bites somebody, which they might not do, they might just go into a barking fit, which still served a valuable purpose. 3 in my experience, dogs know who should and shouldn't be in the house and react accordingly once they've identified you. even when i used to come home from the bar at 1am trying to sneak in so my wife doesn't yell at me, my dogs recognized me as soon as they're close enough to smell me. but not before they woke up the whole house to announce that a potential robber was coming in! this drastically reduces the chances of 'friendly fire' from a panicky person firing gunshots randomly in their house. 4 a well trained dog isn't a hazard. my pit bull boxer mix patiently watches my son try to chew on him. my shepard mix thinks that my son is his best friend and tries to comfort him when he starts crying. i can leave my son alone with my 2 dogs and know that when i come back i'll

if you can show me some legal precedent that a dog used for self defense is at least as legally precarious as shooting a gun at a home invader.","not everyone can own take care of a dog allergies, cost, property restrictions on animals also guns are more so used as a deterrent to crime rather than an actual stopper of crime. a guy breaking into your house hears the sound of a shotgun being cocked will almost definitely dissuade them from continuing to try and victimize that individual. which neighborhood would a criminal be more likely to rob, the neighborhood that has strict gun laws preventing owners in that community from owning firearms or the one that doesn't? not to say dogs aren't a good home defense tool but i think the right to have both is important.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i'm going to take a stab at it. first of all, i don't think it's a good idea to have a gun in your house. if you're in the middle of the night, you're going to need a gun to defend yourself. second, i'm not sure what you mean by'self defense fantasy'. i think you're talking about the idea that you could be awoken, armed and thinking straight","i don't know if i can change your view, but i'm going to take a stab at it. first of all, i'm not a gun owner. i don't own a gun. i own a shotgun. i have no idea how to use it. second, i've never been in a situation where i had to use a gun to defend myself. i've been in situations where i didn't have a gun, and i have never been able to use one."

" The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part","the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation? answer: they know people will pay to see it. 3. i think all the changes they have typically made between the original and the modern remakes have been 100 for the worse from my standpoint but 100 for the safer from a marketing standpoint. e. g. instead of the beast from beauty and the beast being a beast , he s like a tall muscly guy with a hairy face. in the cartoon he was an actual monster, not unlike a bearwolf hybrid. but this was more palatable in the 3d animation medium to marketers."," The modern remakes of older Disney movies (the new or upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, etc.) have never been exciting or good or hype-worthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening, cynical and blatant greed on Disney’s part : the most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. makes me nostalgic. 2. it s what we love but made with better effects production value. 3. it s like a shakespeare play, we haven t seen this version of x story. and here s why i think each of those arguments completely fails: 1. yeah, that s exactly the point. disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that s why they ve chosen these properties. not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre production. 2. this argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. the transformers films had better effects than the tv show. doesn t mean they weren t steaming piles of garbage. surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars. not to mention was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking, wow, this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices. the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films. why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation?

 People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion.,"i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to? i feel like my life would be over if i was forced harshly to be a mother. also, i understand some of you will say that the child could be put up for adoption. however, i still believe that the woman shouldn t have to go through with the pregnancy, it should be her choice. even if somebody else can t conceive a child doesn t mean somebody else should. having a few less children in the world will be good. i understand that you may be pro life, which is fine. but i just think that they shouldn t project their views onto other women as we all deserve to make the choice for ourselves. it has been brought to my attention that things are different in the us than in the uk."," People should never make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion. : i believe everybody is absolutely entitled to their own opinion. being forced to have a child when one does not want one is like locking them up for life imprisonment, as you will never be able to live he life you want and it will always be different to what you wanted. and it is still no reason to force somebody to have a child if they have gone through rape or if their child has a disability and they cannot cope, or if they simply are not ready for a child. i think that that the argument that women should use birth control is a bad argument, as not even perfect use of birth control gives 100 effectiveness. at the end of the day, why should a woman be forced to go through a pregnancy, which has its toll on a woman, if she doesn t want to? i feel like my life would be over if i was forced harshly to be a mother. also, i understand some of you will say that the child could be put up for adoption. however, i still believe that the woman shouldn t have to go through with the pregnancy, it should be her choice. even if somebody else can t conceive a child doesn t mean somebody else should. having a few less children in the world will be good. i understand that you may be pro life, which is fine. but i just think that they shouldn t project their views onto other women as we all deserve to make the choice for ourselves. it has been brought to my attention that things are different in the us than in the uk.","to be honest, if someone wants to take an abortion, they should probably just do it because it's best for them, society and the baby if they just had the abortion because they clearly weren't prepared to have a child yet. but i feel that we should actually shame women for it because of the economical implications of abortion! there have been more than 58 million abortions, most of it would be due to not being able to raise the child, not wanting the child or accidental pregnancy while the rest would be to not want to bring an ill child to this world or something to that effect. now, abortions can cost from 0 975 so i read, could be more so we have spent billions at most and millions most probably on abortions that wouldn't have happened if these people took contraceptive pills, we need to shame them so that they more likely take steps like taking contraceptive pills because that money wasted could've gone to somewhere else more productive!",i don't think it's fair to force a woman to have a child when she doesn't want one. i think it is unfair to force women to have children when they don't want them.,i don't think it's fair to make a woman feel bad for getting an abortion. it's not fair to force a woman to go through a pregnancy when she doesn't want to.
" If Jesus came to US politics, most conservatives/Republicans would be against him and his views","i think most of teachings of jesus are liberal in nature. matthew 5:9 cons: traditionally 'war hawks'. supported invasions of vietnam and iraq more than most liberals. john 8:7 blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. matthew 5:7 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your father forgive your trespasses. matthew 6:15 cons: support death penalty and harsher punishments for criminals.

take germany. germany didn t even exist until 1871, and it was not at all obvious in advance how it would come together. what really united the prussians of koenigsburg with the swabians of w rttemberg? is schleswig german or danish? is alsace german or french? should the ethno state unite under prussian or austrian domination? what about the german speakers in suedtirol and sudetenland? or the volga germans? before ethnic nationalism, those questions weren t particularly important. with ethnic nationalism, it took multiple catastrophic wars to settle them. you mention foreigners going back to their homeland. but in many cases people were in their homelands, only for their homeland to become someone else s ethnostate. if the german ethnostate was going to use these ancient homelands to lay claim to territory von der maas bis an die memel and von der etsch bis an den belt, then the obvious solution was to expel everyone from those homelands. by the logic of the ethnostate, ethnic cleansing makes sense. the same story repeats itself for every ethnostate. france looks unified today, because they spent the last 200 years suppressing anyone who didn t fit the mold of french. the spanish attempt at an ethnostate inspired a violent ethnic revolt yugoslavia united itself under the banner of the southern slavs, until they remembered that croatians, serbians and bosniaks are completely different, even if their families had lived next door for hundreds of years. ethnostates look great if you re in the dominant group, but there really isn t any way to make one without a trail of atrocity and abuse along the way.","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i'm going to try to change your view in a different way. firstly, i don't think it's a good idea to keep the word 'german' in its current form. it's just a word that is used to describe a group of people, and it's used to refer to a group that has been around for thousands of years. i'm not saying that it's bad, but it's","i'm not sure what you mean by ethno states, but i think there are a lot of problems with them. first of all, there is the fact that there is a huge amount of cultural diversity in europe. europe is a melting pot of countless cultures, especially if it has to do with white people and european culture. i don't see the harm of every country and people maintaining their unique beautiful cultures, genetic print and general way of life and acting like"

 Cast iron cookware fucking sucks.,"it is simply so heavy and unsanitary to me. so much stuff sticks to them and they seem so so dirty to me. if you scrub them, they are literally impossible to get clean if you run your finger across it, it s pretty much guaranteed to have stuff on it , and they are so high maintenance and rust prone. you have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off. it s disgusting, heavy, and high maintenance, with no super amazing benefits. change my view."," Cast iron cookware fucking sucks. : it is simply so heavy and unsanitary to me. so much stuff sticks to them and they seem so so dirty to me. if you scrub them, they are literally impossible to get clean if you run your finger across it, it s pretty much guaranteed to have stuff on it , and they are so high maintenance and rust prone. you have to rub oils and salts into them so they actually taste right. you have to scrape off burnt bits that are so unbelievably stuck on you can t get them off. it s disgusting, heavy, and high maintenance, with no super amazing benefits. change my view.","first, cast iron is far superior to others for many reasons, but to me mainly because of the very high heat retention, which is a product of the heaviness. this gives you much more uniform cooking all the way around. have you ever boiled water in a cheap pan on an electric coil stove and noticed you can see the bubbles in the ring pattern of the coils? your food will cook this unevenly too, but not so with a good cast iron because it distributes the heat better. this heat retention also helps with cooking meat. want to brown a roast? you need high sustained heat for that. the problem with other pans is that as soon as the roast touches the pan, the roast cools the pan down to too low a temperature to brown it well, while the stove struggles to keep the temperature up. but with cast iron, get that sucker smoking hot and go for it. the same applies to steaks. steaks made on aluminum suck, but they can be great on cast iron. it also helps for frying because the heat retention helps keep the oil at a constant temperature. you dunk your fries in, the oil tries to cool down, the pan has heat immediately available on all sides to keep it hot, then the stove works to reheat the pan. now as to care and expectations. don't take a brand new cast iron and try to cook an egg in it. cast iron is seasoned using carbon deposits from oils, that's the 'gunk' on it that you want to keep, and it protects it from sticking and rust. after a time, and with proper care, this seasoning only gets better and better. eventually it will form a practically non stick surface that will have your eggs sliding right off. i have a jet black pan that little can stick to. in the early days stick to frying things that don't tend to stick. in the exact opposite of teflon, the pan will only get better with each use. as for cleaning? who needs soap and scrubbing like with stainless steel? who needs to worry about harming that delicate teflon surface? with a well seasoned pan i can usually just rinse it in the sink and wipe with a paper towel. if something stuck a little, a light rub with a steel scrubbing pad takes care of it. added bonus, it makes for a great self defense weapon in a pinch. more bonus, treated right, the pan will last longer than you, your kids, and your grandkids. and more, when heated to high temperature they don't give off poisonous vapors like non stick pans do. if you way overheat them say, left a dry pan on high and you walked away for a while , the worst that happens is your burn off your seasoning and kitchen is full of regular smoke. then you re season and start over. okay, one last thing. they are the best for cooking food that goes from stove to oven. the absolute best corn bread is made by melting butter in a cast iron skillet on medium heat, pouring the batter in, waiting for it to bubble a bit, and then putting it in the oven to bake. the crust is heavenly. the same applies for pineapple upside down cake. you're missing out if you're just making that in a baking pan. no, get all that butter and brown sugar sizzling, drop in your pineapples and cherries, dump in the batter, then put it in the oven. with a properly seasoned pan the cake will fall right out. i suggest watching some videos about cast iron seasoning. it makes more sense when you can see what a good pan looks like and what it can do.","i don't know if i can change your view, but i'm going to take a stab at it. first off, i don't think you're going to be able to get rid of all of the stuff that sticks to your finger. it's not like you have to rub oils and salts into them to get them off, it's just that you don't want them to stick to you. secondly, you're not going to have a problem getting rid of any of the","i don't know what you're talking about, but i'm going to try to change your view. i'm not going to argue that cast iron cookware is disgusting, heavy and unsanitary, with no super amazing benefits. however, i would like to point out that i don't have a problem with the smell of cast iron cookingware. it's just that it's not as bad as you think it is."
 Parents should not tell their kids it's OK to be a failure.,"ok, so i already know that i'm going to get a lot of heat for this, and the kind of heat, so let me plea my case. it is my belief that each success, failure, good and bad person thing we meet experience brings us a step closer to who we truly are. that said, when we fail, go through a bad breakup, fall out with a close friend, etc. , therein lies the opportunity for growth, learning, and strength after some unavoidable pain and grief. here's my problem with that: in telling their child that it is ok to fail, which in some instances is totally fair and ok, there still lies a huge number of people who use this unconditional love as a means to blockade their inner feelings of inadequacy and mediocrity. i believe the most deep feelings of inner strength comes from within; it comes during the times you're sitting in a room, all alone with the weight of the world on your shoulders, and it being so heavy that you cease to feel anything at all. however, after this seemingly deadlocked state, something snaps and a fire bursts from within, and we become so consumed with the flame kindled from our own pain and emptiness, that we obsessively work to build a new self, and that self becomes volumes more indestructible than that which is cultivated after an extensive coddling period with mom and dad where you set off again at the suit of your leisure. this is the difference between intermittent rehab and surviving then living, and i mean being truly alive. it's in essence, the grown up version of when a little kid falls down and immediately runs to their parent's pantleg to cry and hide their face. i guess one could call it tough love, but because of the collectivist culture in america, this is the norm, because we have 'american family values.

but cardi b s music is just awful. like what has music come to. now rap seems like it s all about flexing. oh i fuck all the chicks and i make a lot of money like i seriously couldn t give a shit. i want meaningful music. i know this has gone off topic but like i just keep typing and i can t stop. cardi b shouldn t have already gotten awards you have to earn those. like for many artists it takes a couple years. you have to grow. cardi b just came into the spotlight and in a year bam she s automatically the next madonna . like no, she needs to make real music. even ariana grande who charts without even trying she still makes music that s sounds unique to each album. like yours truly had kind of a 50 s vibe to it for multiple songs. my everything was a tiny bit r amp;b and pop. dangerous woman had it s own sound. sweetner has gone more hip hop. she s constantly reinventing her sound and doing a hell of a job of it. now i understand that cardi b hasn t had the time to release four

don t know where this is going so i ll probably end it here. maybe i m just a bitch idk lol. also cardi b came out like last year or something hayley kiyoko released her first album this april. hayley kiyoko deserves so much love and fame. she sounds unique and writes her music from the heart. she helped me realize my true sexuality after repressing the thoughts over and over again because it was a sin . she taught me it was okay to be gay or bisexual in my case. okay imma go bye.","what specific thing makes her super overrated? is it her english? the fact that you prefer another artist more? i understand the annoying part, just a little confused about why you think she's overrated?","i don't think it's fair to say that cardi b is the best new artist in the world. i think she's a great

 Our current political culture is disturbing. A person's entire worth is decided based on their political opinons.

' this, however, is self contradictory because predjudice for racial reasons is the definition of racism. i don't know what can change my view on this, but i am looking forward to hearing your counter arguments!","first, let us start with a pretty simple definition of racism: racism: treating a race as inferior to everyone else or believing your race is superior to all other races you can go check the dictionary, but they all basically boil down to this definition ' superiority' now, the whole superiority thing is important. if you think a race is 'different', but you don't think that the difference makes them better worse, then you aren't really racist. it may be a lot of other things, but it isn't automatically racist. example: i think that asians have crustier ear wax than other races this isn't racist reverse racism 'reverse racism' is really not describing traditional racism. when people are being 'reverse racist' against white people, they aren't assuming white people are dumber more violent etc. they are simply directing malice towards them based on their race. 'disliking someone because of their race' is not racism. it is bigotry. however, people don't really like using that word 'bigoted' for some reason. it is the technically correct word, but people won't use it. why do people use the term. people can absolutely be racist against white people. i know some chinese people who are racist as fuck about white people. however, this isn't what anyone is talking about when they discuss 'reverse racism'. 'reverse racism' is a buzzword to describe anti white bigotry and sentiment which exists in minority communities, frequently because of perceived racism from the white people against the minorities. many white people feel that the backlash against white people has become too severe and now this 'reverse racism' bigotry threatens to over correct and cause even more racial animosity than existed when white people were originally being super racist. it is just a word that tries to sum up a lot of political sentiment at once and wrap it in a neat little package. lots of terms like this one homophobe describes anti gay people and attempts to accuse them of secretly fearing gay people fake news a borrowed term, which was originally used to describe actual false journalism, but is now used to insult tainted or biased journalism or the appearance of bias these terms are used to quickly allow people of similar persuasions to connect and recognize one another and share the sentiment without having to share a long winded conversation. they are literally 'memes'. they are almost never as simple as you are trying to make them. if you appreciate the context and historical background of the ideas being expressed by the speakers, you will realize why they are used and why people argue against them.",i don't think it's possible to be prejudiced against white people but not racist against black people.,"i'm not sure what you mean by 'racism', but i think it's important to note that it's not the definition of racism that you're talking about. it's the idea that people who are prejudiced against white people can be racist against black people, but that doesn't mean that they can't be racist towards black people. it just means that there's a difference between being racist against a black person and being racist towards a white person."

Therapy should be mandatory in high school,"we could solve a lot of problems in this world if people just worked on their baggage. everyone has baggage because no parent is perfect and children with

anger. they also have broken logic, processing the world in black and white . even if you don't have 'severe' problems, everyone could use with therapy to see their own broken thinking patterns that they developed as a child. every time you see someone using a strawman argument, red herring, or 'whataboutemails', they're using broken logic that inevitably also makes other areas of their life miserable. sweeping generalisations, catastrophic thinking, black and white thinking, these are all patterns that therapy will tell you to work on getting rid of to lead a better life. most of all, everyone should at least try once, the experience of talking with absolutely no filter or judgement. even with your closest friend, your spouse, you have a filter on because you don't want to be judged or hurt others feelings or keep a secret. in a strong community, the role of therapist is fulfilled by a good priest or or counselor or coach or wise person. update most of the comments

" Most cyclists on the road are incredibly inconsiderate and rude, and we should enforce them not getting in the way far more than we do.","maybe it's just where i live. but every morning evening when i drive to from work, there are packs of cyclists riding around. i think cycling is great. however my issue is often the attitude of these cyclists. they are less visible. it will be dark and many of them do not wear anything to stick out properly. they often travel in packs. packs that, instead of riding single file along the side of the road, clump together blocking huge portions of the road. i see no reason why this is necessary. the result is they cause traffic jams and instill fear in drivers like me."," Most cyclists on the road are incredibly inconsiderate and rude, and we should enforce them not getting in the way far more than we do. : maybe it's just where i live. but every morning evening when i drive to from work, there are packs of cyclists riding around. i think cycling is great. however my issue is often the attitude of these cyclists. they are less visible. it will be dark and many of them do not wear anything to stick out properly. they often travel in packs. packs that, instead of riding single file along the side of the road, clump together blocking huge portions of the road. i see no reason why this is necessary. the result is they cause traffic jams and instill fear in drivers like me.","cyclists are encouraged to cycle in the middle of the lane rather than against the curb for two main reasons. a the edge of the road contains most debris and drains which can be lethal hazards to cyclistsb you ve already alluded to trying to squeeze past cyclists within your own lane . this is dangerous and irresponsible and is the very reason cyclists block you from doing it. on your point about packs, they re far easier to overtake assuming they are in one lane than a long string of cyclists, simply by waiting for a space on the other side of the road. the only way to overtake a long string of cyclists is by dangerously squeezing past them as per b . treat it as a tractor. it s slow, it s an annoyance, but is has as much right to be there as you. only overtake when it is actually safe to do so. if you know that cyclists are prevalent on your route then leave an extra 2 mins early to account for the minimal delay you experience.","i don't think it's a good idea to have packs of cyclists on the side of the road. i think it would be better to have them in packs, rather than in packs.","i don't think it's fair to say that most cyclists on the road are inconsiderate and rude, but i think you're underestimating the amount of people who ride in the middle of the road."
 Artificial intelligence can't become conscious.,"i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there? ultimately, a computer is little more than a memory store and a processor. programs are stored in memory and their instructions are fed one by one into the processor. the instructions themselves are incredibly simple load and store numbers in memory, add or subtract these numbers, jump to a different instruction based on the result that's actually about all you need. all other instructions implemented by modern processors could be written in terms of these. computer memory doesn't have to be implemented via electrical transistors. you can use dots on a sheet of paper or a bunch of rocks sitting in a vast desert. likewise, the execution of program instructions doesn't have to be automated a mathematician could calculate by hand each instruction individually and write out the result on a piece of paper. it shouldn't make a difference as far as the software is concerned. what if our mathematician, hand computing the code to our ai, wrote out all of his work a complete trace of the program's execution? let's say he never erased anything. for each instruction in the program, he'd simply write out the instruction, its result, the address of the next instruction, and the addresses values of all updates to memory or, alternatively, a copy of all memory allocated by the program that includes these updates . after running the program to completion, what if our mathematician did it all again a second time? the same program, the same initial memory values. would a consciousness be created a second time, albeit having exactly the same experiences? a negative answer to this question would be very bizarre. how could the universe possibly remember that this particular program was already run once before and thereby force all subsequent executions to not develop consciousness? what if a layman came by and copied down the mathematician's written work, but without understanding it. why should it matter whether he understands what he's writing? arguably even the mathematician didn't understand the whole program, only each instruction in isolation. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, when written down, would automatically develop consciousness? what if our mathematician did not actually write out the steps of this second execution. what if he just read off all of his work from the first run and verified mentally that each instruction was processed correctly. would this mean there exists a sequence of symbols which, if even just read , would automatically develop consciousness? why should the universe care whether or not someone is actively reading these symbols? why should the number of times the program develops consciousness depend on the number of people who simply read it? to change my view, you could explain to me how a program running on a modern future turing equivalent computer could develop consciousness, but would not if run on a computationally equivalent but mechanically simpler machine. alternatively, you could make the argument that my absurd consequences don't actually follow from my premises that there's a fundamental difference between what our mathematician does and what happens in an electronic fluidic mechanical computer. you could also argue that the human brain might actually be a hypercomputer and that hyper computation is a realistic direction for ai research, thereby invalidating my argument which depends on turing equivalence. what won't change my view, however, are arguments along the lines of 'since humans are conscious, therefore it must be possible to create a consciousness by simulating a human brain'. such a thing would mean that my absurd conclusions have to be true, and it seems disingenuous to hold an absurd view simply because it's the least absurd of all others that i currently know of."," Artificial intelligence can't become conscious. : i believe that it is not possible for a mere computer program, running on a turing equivalent machine, to ever develop consciousness. alternatively, perhaps our brains are capable of hyper computation but this is not a serious field of research because all known models of hyper computers can't exist in our universe except possibly at the edges of black holes where space time does weird things, but i think it's safe to say that humans aren't walking around with black holes in their heads . i shall consider these possibilities outside of the scope of this cmv, since ai research isn't headed in those directions. my reason for believing this was inspired by a bunch of rocks the way we design computers today is totally arbitrary and nothing like how a human brain operates. our brains are made up of a large network of neurons connected via axons and dendrites which send signals chemically through a variety of different neurotransmitters. modern computers, by contrast, are made up of a large network of transistors connected via tiny wires which send binary electrical signals. if it was possible to write a program which, if run on a computer, develops a consciousness, then this difference would imply that consciousness likely doesn't depend on the medium upon which the computations are performed. computers of the past used to be based on vacuum tubes or relays instead of transistors. it's also possible to design a computer based on fludic logic in which signals are sent as pressure waves through a fluid instead of an electrical pulse. there are even designs for a purely mechanical computer engine . the important point is that you can build a turing equivalent computer using any of these methods. the same ai software could be run on any of them, albeit probably much more slowly. if it can develop a consciousness on any one of them, it ought to be able to develop a consciousness on all of them. but why stop there?

 I'm on course to vote no to the upcoming abortion referendum.,while i've been pro choice most of my life that's begun to change. what brought this on was the online discussion surrounding people with down syndrome and the news that most mothers who are made aware of their unborn having ds opting to abort. while i find this very sad ultimately it's very difficult to raise a child with ds and i can't force that responsibility on a family. what i can't justify to myself however is how this screening technology will be developed to apply to gay people in the future. there are physiological differences between straight and gay people and this is a subject of research. in the event a test is developed that detects gayness in foetuses with reasonable accuracy i realise this will lead to gay babies being aborted and that's what i find objectionable. it may sound silly but medical technology is always improving by leaps and bounds and when the technology of tomorrow meets the laws of today i fear it will lead to a portion of the gay community disappearing and i don't want that. i suppose the core view i want changed if a woman's choice to abort is always moral even if the reason is homophobia or some bigotry like that. i think if you're aborting a foetus because of a benign trait it will manifest in the future you are no longer treating it as a foetus but as a person it will become and it's my belief gay rights override the right to choice in this circumstance. in other words i have a gut feeling that voting to repeal will mean condemning future gay men and women to pre emptive deaths. i'd like to be convinced i'm wrong. thanks for taking the time to read and i'll be here a few hours., I'm on course to vote no to the upcoming abortion referendum. : while i've been pro choice most of my life that's begun to change. what brought this on was the online discussion surrounding people with down syndrome and the news that most mothers who are made aware of their unborn having ds opting to abort. while i find this very sad ultimately it's very difficult to raise a child with ds and i can't force that responsibility on a family. what i can't justify to myself however is how this screening technology will be developed to apply to gay people in the future. there are physiological differences between straight and gay people and this is a subject of research. in the event a test is developed that detects gayness in foetuses with reasonable accuracy i realise this will lead to gay babies being aborted and that's what i find objectionable. it may sound silly but medical technology is always improving by leaps and bounds and when the technology of tomorrow meets the laws of today i fear it will lead to a portion of the gay community disappearing and i don't want that. i suppose the core view i want changed if a woman's choice to abort is always moral even if the reason is homophobia or some bigotry like that. i think if you're aborting a foetus because of a benign trait it will manifest in the future you are no longer treating it as a foetus but as a person it will become and it's my belief gay rights override the right to choice in this circumstance. in other words i have a gut feeling that voting to repeal will mean condemning future gay men and women to pre emptive deaths. i'd like to be convinced i'm wrong. thanks for taking the time to read and i'll be here a few hours.,"you want to force women to bear unwanted children now , force the responsibility of raising children with down syndrome now , risk their health and financial stability now because of something that might happen at some point in the future? i privilege not causing real and present pain and not forcing real and present burdens over hypothetical bigotry. if by the time we can reliably determine that a fetus will be gay, gay rights are such that those babies are being aborted, we can talk then about preventative measures banning those tests, for example.",i don't think it's fair to say that gay people should be forced to carry a child with down syndrome. i think it is fair to point out that there is a difference between gay people and straight people.,"i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to remember that abortion is not a choice. it's a choice, and it's not a right to be forced to do it. you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do, but you can force someone else to do what they want with their body. i'm not saying that gay people shouldn't be allowed to have abortions, i'm just saying that you shouldn't"

 It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged,"i am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. english is not my native language so i will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. for the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million usd. any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. in fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. now, i am not saying hand out the poor free money. that makes people dependant. rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. what benefits society is considered the most important. reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. the virtues of simple living are prized highly as well."," It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged : i am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. english is not my native language so i will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. for the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million usd. any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. in fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. now, i am not saying hand out the poor free money. that makes people dependant. rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. what benefits society is considered the most important. reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. the virtues of simple living are prized highly as well.","is it fair to say that you see the suffering of poor people as far and away the best use of money? assuming that's true, might i be able to do more good for them with more money than just donating it? an example might help here. lest say i have 1 that i can donate. the best i can probably do with that is to give it to some poor person so they can afford some food or a bottle if clean water or whatever. but if i have 100, can i find a way to do more than 100x the good? like, maybe by building a water pump to get clean water. that pump would provide more than 100 worth of food for those people over its lifetime. but what if we scale it further? maybe if i had 100million that i could spend, i could finance the building of a factory that makes the water pumps in their country. so i'm providing jobs for people while still indirectly helping them get clean water. if i'm improving the entire country, i'm probably doing proportionally more good than just giving a million pumps. if you follow this line of logic, then it makes sense to make as much money as i can, and simply donate most of it when i die. this is because it's a lot easier to make a lot of money if you already have a lot of money, so if i'm keeping myself at your 50 mil cap, i'm limiting the net amount of good that i'll be able to do in my lifetime.","the problem with your view is that it assumes that the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. this is not the case. the problem is that you assume that the rich have a 'right' to that excess money, which is not necessarily true. in fact, it is true that the wealthy are entitled to this excess money as long as it is not in the hands of the poor. however, the problem with this is that there is no such thing as a right.","i'm not sure what you're talking about here, but i think it's important to remember that you're not talking about the rich, but about the poor. the rich are the ones who have the most wealth, and the poor have the least wealth. the poor are the people who don't have the money, but the rich have the ability to spend their money on things that they don't need. if you want to spend your money on something that you don't like,"

 Crimes involving breach of trust should have more severe legal repercussions than the similar ones without.,"to elucidate my view, i'll try to frame an illustration. consider two acts of theft being performed which constitute as a crime under legal purview. case a: a man is walking down a lonely street late at night. suddenly, a mugger appears out of nowhere and robs him at gunpoint. case b: a man is walking down a busy street. a stranger walks to him seeking for help, describing a life and death situation. on humanitarian grounds, the man follows the stranger who leads him to not so happening street only to realize that it's all a setup. he is then robbed after being held at gun point. now, it is reasonable to state that the ultimate outcome in both of the cases was the man ended up being robbed. however when considered on a profound level, the varying experiences have resulted in different psychological impacts on that person. in case a, it is streetwise to avoid a deserted road to prevent from being taken advantage of. hence, the man would have estimated the probability of getting mugged and made a conscious decision. this would then conform to his existing prejudice about travelling isolated roads at night, which he would definitely avoid in the near future. however an experience from case b would have definitely scarred him by affecting his school of thought towards humanity. it would drive him to a conclusion that it is better off to avoid helping a human or anybody for that matter to avoid the risk of a false case. the next time he sees someone asking for help, even though his conscience would provoke him to provide assistance, his previous experience would say otherwise, thus deterring him from bestowing a respectable act of humanity. on an individual level it would not make a big difference, but consider the impact it would have if hundreds of individuals were robbed in a similar manner. it would then go on to be a preconceived notion that helping somebody en route to an isolated location would have disastrous implications. now imagine the plight of a person asking for help if his case was genuine. statistics suggest that majority of rape victims knew their perpetrators at least at a hierarchical level of an acquaintance. if this keeps on increasing individuals would be wary of accomplices, thus developing trust issues. events like this would make humans lean on individualism and would make them think twice before trusting other humans. and this, as far as the functioning of society is considered, would be the worst thing to happen to it. the basic intention of law is to ensure that humans act in a civilized manner in a society. however what use would the law be if society ceased to exist."," Crimes involving breach of

often involve some sort of binding contract. there's also theft by deception, which seems to fit your mugging example pretty well:different states have various definitions of what is considered deception, but they typically include language such as words or conduct that create a false impression. this is probably more often invoked when someone misrepresents themself in a professional setting, e. g. a fake sales pitch or business transaction, but if the wording is something like what's shown on that legal advice page it could potentially be applied to more personal and less professional breaches of trust.","i don't think it's possible to change your view without changing your view. i think you're missing the point of the law, which is to protect people from being mugged.

about being robbed, you just have to be aware of the consequences.","i don't think it's possible to change your view, but i think you're missing the point of the argument. if you're going to make the

 The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist.,"note that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed. at the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless. i am very aware i am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber. a few of my thoughts summed up: 1. ken: hey did you hear about janet?

 Certain private companies like the social media/tech giants should be bound by similar free speech laws as the government.,"let me start off by saying i do not think we should tolerate intolerance, but at the same time i am against censorship. these laws exist for very valid reasons, and in some places have a few, also valid, exceptions, such as calling for violence against a person or group. this means that a restaurant for example, can expel guests who are obnoxiously sharing extreme political opinions. now here is where my issue arises. take facebook for example. a social media site with billions of users. whether you agree with it or not, many people get their news from facebook. be it through news outlets posting articles on their pages, or groups sharing them, a very large number of people get their information about a plethora of topics from facebook. due to this fact, facebook has almost unprecedented power over what people can see. what can start off as extreme opinions that call for violence, ie something very clear cut and easy to determine, can slowly erode into something more grey and harder to define like 'no bigotry'. now i know this may seem like a slippery slope argument, but i am not saying it will necessarily turn into this, but simply highlighting that it is possible, and i don't think it should be. if facebook decided to update their policy to exclude things in a more vague way this could have far reaching impacts on the social sphere. there simply aren't any other platforms besides maybe twitter that can compete with facebook in terms of reaching a large audience. if you have an opinion or something you want to share, if you are barred from the widest used social media network, you are cut off from the largest way to share that idea. another perhaps more effective example would be if google skewed search results to favour a certain narrative. if searching something neutral like 'trump' in google brought up almost exclusively negative or positive articles, that would seriously impact how information was shared. google is perhaps the biggest example because they are not only a search engine, but the premier search engine for most people globally. i am aware that this would infringe upon the company's right to do what they want with their own property, but in the circumstances i think it is a reasonable concession.","

 Male and female heterosexuality are different,"based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective? i mean after all male bisexuality was prominent in certain circles of greek and roman culture, but is on the fringe of our own culture."," Male and female heterosexuality are different : based on the people i've talked to, and research i've read, i think heterosexual men tend to be exclusively attracted to women physically, while heterosexual women usually are physically attracted to people of both sexes despite only having romantic interest in men. as a hetero guy i find someone like younger brad pitt sexy but not to the point that i physically get turned on, more in the sense of admiration and mild envy. i get the idea that straight women often do get turned on thinking about other women, even if they wouldn't necessarily do sexual things with them. most straight men who watch porn find gay porn gross but many straight women prefer lesbian porn over straight porn because it often has less of a 'male gaze'. i think part of the reason why women have an in group bias towards other women that men lack with other men is because they are attracted to other women to some degree, albeit usually not to the extent they would want to have sex or relationships with them. some people would say that 'all women are bisexual' but i disagree; i think it would be better explained that men and women who are heterosexual experience their orientation differently. if you're turned on by someone of the same sex but not to the point that actual contact would be enjoyable i'd still consider that person straight. one thing that might counter my hypothesis is perhaps the male gaze is so prevalent in culture that many women end up viewing other women's bodies from a straight male perspective? i mean after all male bisexuality was prominent in certain circles of greek and roman culture, but is on the fringe of our own culture.","i'd argue that the societal influences on behavior can't be overlooked here. western society deems it more acceptable for predominantly heterosexual women to experiment with the same sex, and does not afford this same thing to men. surely that has some influence on sexual behavior and sexual desires that someone is willing to admit both to themselves and to others.","i'm not sure if this is true or not, but i think it depends on what you mean by'sexual attraction'. if you mean attraction to other people, then i think that's a bit of an oversimplification. i'm a straight male, and i'm not attracted to women. i don't find women attractive. i find men attractive, but not to the point that i physically get turned on by other women to some degree. that's not to say that i","i'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but i think it's important to note that bisexuality is not the same thing as heterosexuality. bisexuality isn't about being attracted to people of the same sex, it's about wanting to have sex with someone of the opposite sex. it's not about being sexually attracted to other people, it is about being able to have sexual relations with other people. i think you're confusing bisexuality with heterosexuality, which is"

 The USA should bring back compulsory service,"all would be required to serve for some x amount of years. serving in the military should still be available as an option but other accommodations should be made for differing beliefs. if you feel alright about us foreign policy you can do x years in the military, but if you are opposed to it you could do x year serving as a policeman. if you're a pacifist you could do x years serving as an emt for some public hospital or x years in the peace corps. forcing people to serve together in this way would accomplish a couple things: 1 ensures that well trained citizenry is always nearby and ready in case of catastrophe. in a world with this type of service, if a terrorist attack were to occur: 1 4 of all people in the vicinity will be trained soldiers, 1 4 will be trained police, 1 to 2 4 will have some medical training. first responders would already be there because everybody would basically be a first responder. 2 provides young people with something to do. in my mind the service would occur in the 18 22 time frame so that it comes before college. i don't know about any of you but i was someone who went to college because that was just the thing to do. no one had gone before me and that was the route to success, so there i went. it worked for me the debt was real but i got solid job out of it but it doesn't work out for a lot of folks. not only that but asking an 18 year old to decide the institution and career that may define the rest of their lives and saddle them with a mountain of debt seems insane to me. who the fuck knows anything at 18? 3 increases national unity. soldiers peace corp should serve with others from across the country, while police emts should work in parts of the city different form where they live. doing this ensures that all americans are for at least some short time in their lives forced to reckon with their fellow countrymen. besides providing perspective this also helps foster a sense of egalitarianism since it will provide the sense that a citizenship has been 'earned.

 We are all terrible people* knowing that the products we buy employ slavery.,"terrible defined as: extremely bad in a serious fashion. including, but no where near limited to: iphones, apple devices, samsung devices, many walmart products, nestle products, h amp;m products, cannabis, firestone tires, diamonds, internet pornography, and more. most of these labor sources are found in africa, particularly the ivory coast, nigeria, liberia, the middle east, asia, particularly china, and various locations in south america. and it's not necessary, there are alternatives. some may be harder to acquire, some may be more inefficient, some may be more expensive, but there are alternatives. which, yes, requires strict research this makes us entirely hypocritical when we judge others for deemed 'immoral actions' such as 'sex trafficking, rape, political prisons, censorship, abortion if you don't like it and many more. although i don't condone these actions and they are inherently bad, who are we to say that we are much better? i obviously understand the difference between kidnapping someone and buying a phone that hires a company that hires a company that uses underpaid children 4000 miles away. please, for the love of god, change my view."," We are all terrible people* knowing that the products we buy employ slavery. : terrible defined as: extremely bad in a serious fashion. including, but no where near limited to: iphones, apple devices, samsung devices, many walmart products, nestle products, h amp;m products, cannabis, firestone tires, diamonds, internet pornography, and more. most of these labor sources are found in africa, particularly the ivory coast, nigeria, liberia, the middle east, asia, particularly china, and various locations in south america. and it's not necessary, there are alternatives. some may be harder to acquire, some may be more inefficient, some may be more expensive, but there are alternatives. which, yes, requires strict research this makes us entirely hypocritical when we judge others for deemed 'immoral actions' such as 'sex trafficking, rape, political prisons, censorship, abortion if you don't like it and many more. although i don't condone these actions and they are inherently bad, who are we to say that we are much better? i obviously understand the difference between kidnapping someone and buying a phone that hires a company that hires a company that uses underpaid children 4000 miles away. please, for the love of god, change my view.","slavery is not bad per se. one might say we all are slaves anyhow, just the shackles are more hidden in modern society. are you advocating us not to use the items from such origins or are you advocating us to say that, even if they are outcomes of slavery, we should still use it? in both cases one might say that personal comfort triumphs in such cases and justifiably so. if not, everybody would donate all their excess to fellow men.","i'm not sure what you mean by 'good' or 'bad', but i think it's important to distinguish between 'bad' and 'good'. if you mean 'good', then i think you're right. however, if you're talking about 'bad,' then i don't think that's a good definition of 'bad.'i think that you're looking at it from a different angle, which is a bit of an oversimplification. if you are talking about",i don't think it's possible to change your view without knowing that the products we buy employ slavery.
