1387,"yeah, i know, popular opinion, but i do want to hear the other side. i don't think i've ever seen a unique argument by someone who unironically uses the npc meme. pretty much all of their comments are: 'npc liberals' 'orange man bad' ' lt;insert code here gt;' and there's no actual unique meme made by said users. when questioned on how repetitive they are, they claim 'liberals are the real npcs.

1097,"i apologize in advance for the negativity of this post but i really hate furries. but for some reason got the feeling that this hate is based off of weak arguments and i just got the idea to ask about it since i'm pretty open minded. i'll try to list as many arguments as i can. paedophilia: i always see furries that are paedophiles and who draw ub rn, and i don't know if it's just me or that these paedofurs are far more visible frequent than, let's say people who draw l l . every other week i see these people getting called out for being a paedophile doing something paedophilic drawing ub etc. especially the whole zaush rc fox tacklebox scandals. more on that later. like i don't ever see this going on in the brony fandom i hate them too or anime fandoms, why furries of all people? unless if i'm wrong, this really makes me believe that furries are full of paedophiles. supplementary reading t : whenever someone fu ks up, even if it's a minor fu ku , i always see hordes of furries making fools of themselves. like jumping on people and attacking them, sometimes driving people to suicide as was the case with rc fox . like what the hell is wrong with you? other forms of toxicity include fursuit elitism, rabid fanboyism of 'popufurs' the whole concept of that is fu king n r in itself , self centered egocentrism, assuming that if someone follows someone else who's problematic that they're 'supporting' them and therefore blocking cutting all contact with them, impersonating other people and trying to be them make them look bad, creating rumours about someone because idfk why, not letting go even after things have been settled, etc. like why are furries so goddamn t , yet they claim to be all 'welcoming' and 'understanding'. the only other fandoms i can say that this also happens are the undertale and fnaf fandoms maybe even homestuck but i'm not sure . i don't see this happening in the anime fandoms, which i like to compare the furry fandom to. supplementary reading neckbeards, sjws, depressed people, etc. : i feel like the reason for this is because the fandom is full of fat balding neckbeards, sjws, depressed troubled teenagers, etc. like these fandoms have really different demographics than normal society. i've seen convention videos, really tell me that you don't see more neckbeards ugly guys in them than you see in normal society. why does the furry fandom attract these kind of people? supplementary reading u l t : hoo boy this one's a doozy. you have people having room parties at conventions in which tons of happens and alcohol is consumed, you have thirsty furries creating tons of rn of everything r. i. p. zabivaka and nick wilde , you have tons of people asking you if you want to role play, you have people publicly showcasing their weird kinks on their twitter profiles and after dark accounts, you have paedophiles, you have z h l a, you have b t al t , you have forums and discord servers telegram group chats dedicated to those, you have v r , you have human u , you have leather rubber k nk , you have oh my god, so much to talk about. yet the fandom continues to claim that 'it's not a f t h k nk about sex, we just like animal people, why do people hate this family friendly fandom' quit lying, why do you lie? and also, doing this stuff in public has consequences, like for example, r nfurr t. oh my god seeing that was like a car crash, it's so bad but you can't look away. and i feel like there are too many people who did do this for it to just be brushed off as a 'loud minority'. loud it is, minority it is not. take responsibility people. supplementary video drama: i see this happening literally every other week, and every time i see people behave like leeches and blow things out of proportion and dogpile on the subject. does it really need to be that exacerbated? again, i don't see this in any other fandom. lack of common sense: i see this whenever furry conventions are held. like it's like people are intentionally trying to get their events banned from the venue. one example, r nfurr t. another example, two people in u masks k nk ng out on the floor at fwa 2018, a guy pissing on the floor at blfc 2018, oh, and did i not mention room parties and alcohol already? another thing is people not showering at cons and insisting that they wanna be a 'musky husky'. gross. and then you have people showing outsiders ff and other things, giving the fandom a bad name, and then you complain about why people hate you. people being thirsty tony the tiger. i could go on and on and on i don't know why the fandom is lacking in common sense but i hate it. and it seems like people in other fandoms anime conventions don't do this. problematic popufurs: no other fandom has a hierarchy of popularity like the furry fandom. and now popular people are screwing up, like 2 gryphon and zaush. yet you still have people that support them. the anime fandom doesn't have this social stratification. nazifurs altfurry furry raiders: self explanatory. and again, the anime fandom doesn't have these. bad apples: too many of them to just be a 'loud minority'. why is the furry fandom full of these people. i think you get the point now. aaand that's pretty much it for what i have. go ahead, try to refute explain my claims, i'm open minded.", I really hate furries,"i think you're missing the point of the furry. i think it's important to note that there are a lot of people who hate furries, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. i don't think there are any furries that are necessarily paedophiles.",i don't think it's a good thing that furries are full of paedophiles. i think they're full of people who don't want to be part of the fandom.,"i don't know if you've ever heard of furries, but i think you're missing the point. i don't think the furries are necessarily full of pedophiles.",i don't think it's fair to say that furries are full of paedophiles.
512,"here in australia there has been a wave of activists who maintain that criticising islam is racist. it is becoming heavily frowned upon to criticise any aspect of the religion at all. this kind of reaction against criticising islam is not as strong or as prevalent when criticising other religions, such as christianity. for example: we were discussing religion in class and i brought up some aspects of islam that i do not agree with and some of the contradictory statements. i was told i was being racist and to leave if i didn t correct my opinion and that racism would not be tolerated. i had done the same when we discussed christianity and other religions and it was encouraged to analyse and evaluate and criticise. i don t see how questioning or criticising a religion makes me racist? i am open to changing my view. ed to add: i was pointing out text in the qu ran saying it is okay to beat women and execute people for anal sex. and i said that it contrasted with the notion of islam being a religion of peace. 2 to add: we were in a philosophy class and discussing religious texts. someone said islam was a religion of peace and i said i disagreed. when asked why, i said those two things as an example which are actually stated in the qu ran itself."," it is not racist to disagree with or criticise aspects of Islam because Islam is a religion, not a race.","i don't think it's racist to criticise islam, but i do think it is racist to criticize islam because it is a religion of peace.","it is not racist to not criticise a religion, but it is racist to criticise an aspect of a religion that you don't agree with.","i don't think it's racist to criticise islam, but i think it is racist to criticize other religions.","i don't think it's racist to criticise islam, but i think it is racist to criticize islam because it is a religion of peace."
147,"with yet another school shooting, we find ourselves embroiled in debate over private gun ownership in the us. in my mind, gun control advocates fall into 3 groups. the first is a wide swath of people who believe there should be more gun control, and would support gun control measures they would consider 'reasonable,' but don't have any good idea of what those measures would be. the second are those pushing 'common sense' gun reform in the form of assault weapons bans, enormous licensing fees, and yearly interactions with law enforcement to inspect weapons collections. most of these people claim not to be 100 anti gun and insist they won't pursue guns any further than getting results. the third group are individuals who seek a total weapons ban and are overt in their expression of that feeling. however, if you stop to consider the motivations behind those who are anti gun, it is easy to parse the fact that most of these 'common sense' solutions to gun control come from a life steeped in white privilege. allow me to explain. the first topic commonly associated with the gun control movement is the abolition of 'assault weapons,' mostly because they seem to be the weapon of choice in these style of spree killings, although an awb would have done nothing to curb the violence in texas, as the shooter used a hunting shotgun and handgun. how is pursuing an awb rooted in white privilege, you may ask? with roughly 10,000 homicides by firearm every year, a small percentage less than 2 are killed with rifles in a given year, let alone ar 15's. those pushing an awb insist that they have no interest in banning handguns, which are responsible for 95 of firearm homicides in a given year. it just so happens that the majority of these everyday victims are poor, black, and live in the inner cities. the next idea commonly touted is extreme licensing fees and permits for people interested in owning firearms. it's a solution which, in my mind, would never have stopped an affluent family like the lanza's from obtaining the firearms used in sandy hook, but will completely erode the ability for people who are typically the victims of gun violence from obtaining the means to defend themselves, their homes, and their property. the second part of that coin would be the aspect of forced interaction with law enforcement. frankly, i can't see any law abiding citizen from the inner city wanting to interact with law enforcement in order to excercise their natural right to self defense, especially if they managed to make it to adulthood without being jammed up by the police already. black ccw holders are already being shot, even after announcing the fact that they had a weapon to the police officer conducting the traffic stop. moving further on down the line, those pushing for outright gun bans might see no guns no gun deaths, but they fail to take into account the implications of making a widely pervasive item illegal overnight. an australian style buy back confiscation would require 1 trillion inevitably siphoned from programs supporting the poorest and most vulnerable people , and while i can't imagine sherriff joe lillywhite bringing his deputies to confiscate jim bob's massive gun collection in small town arkansas, i imagine gun control efforts would play out in the inner cities much like the war on drugs has. more brown people shot. more assets seized civilly. more people in jail. the last point i want to make is on the 1 proven method of securing schools from shootings. i don't think it's a coincidence that we're only seeing this phenomena of mass shootings in suburban schools, and that lies in the security provided at inner city schools. i know reddit is having a blast making fun of the sheriff blaming doors for the school shooting, but he ain't wrong. think about every secure government building you've ever entered in your life: controlled entry exit points, metal detector, armed security. inner city schools have the same kinds of setup. yet, when presenting this solution to white suburbanites, the resounding response is an outcry about making schools like prisons. white children should not have to feel like they're going to prison when they go to school even though that's been a sentiment since public schools began . the hypocrisy is astounding, especially from a brigade of people constantly claiming the moral high ground when it comes to race related topics. knock my points out, or produce counter arguments to how i'm totally off base to change my view. i'm not trying to say that the gun control crowd is inherently racist, just that their 'common sense' solutions come from a place of privilege and lack nuanced understanding of how these laws impact those predominantly of a lower socioeconomic status, which many times unfortunately boils down to race.", the gun control debate is steeped in white privilege,"the problem with gun control is that it's not about guns. it's about people who want to protect themselves and their property. the problem with guns is that they're not the only ones who want guns. there are plenty of people who don't want guns, but they don't have the means to defend themselves.","the gun control debate is steeped in white privilege. white privilege isn't the only thing that drives gun violence in the us, it's the fact that white privilege is the most important factor that drives it.",i'm not sure what you mean by 'common sense' gun control.,i think you're missing the point here. i think the problem with gun control is that it's not about 'common sense' gun control. it's about 'the right to self defense' and 'the ability to defend yourself and your property.'it's also about the ability to protect yourself and others.
2138,"human societies should not be organized or primarily concerned with achieving a net increase in human happiness. yes, there will be poor people and wealthy people and the poor people will be less well off, but that does not mean there is necessarily injustice. injustice is created when individuals' rights are violated. if ten poor people mug one wealthy person and steal his money, yes, there will be a net gain in human happiness; ten poor people will be happier and one formerly wealthy person will be unhappier, but it is still wrong that the poor people stole from the wealthy person . society based on the idea of net gains to human happiness is deeply flawed. thus, we should organize society around peoples' individual negative rights being maintained and protected. cmv.", Net Human Happiness should not be the goal of society,"i don't think it's a net increase in human happiness. it's not a net decrease in happiness, it's an increase in happiness.","i don't think it's a net increase in human happiness, but it's not a net decrease in happiness.","i don't think there is a net gain to human happiness, but there is an increase in the amount of people who are poor.",i don't think it's fair to say that a society based on the idea of net gains to human happiness is inherently flawed.
296,"i believe that all humans excluding those with birth defects metal illness are born with the same capacity for learning. there is no concept that cannot be understood, given that a person has both the prerequisite knowledge required for understanding it and a desire to do so. differences in intelligence between individuals can wholly be attributed to their development, experiences, and personality. for example, group a excels in advanced mathematics while group b struggles. this is due to those in group a having a higher affinity towards the subject and more experience with it. however, if group b were to take a sudden interest in mathematics, they already have the same capacity to understand it. this means that once group b learns the same prerequisite knowledge and reaches the same level of experience in mathematics as group a, they will be able to understand all of the same concepts. i cant deny that there are both very intelligent, and very stupid individuals in this world. what i do reject, is the notion that these people are stupid because they have a 'bad brain'. the deficit lies in their personality and a lack in desire for learning in general."," Excluding those with birth defects/mental illness, all humans are born with the same capacity for learning/understanding new concepts.",i think you're missing the point. i'm not saying that all humans with birth defects are born with the same capacity for learning. it's just that we don't have the same ability to understand the world around us.,"i don't think that all humans are born with the same capacity for learning. i think that we are all born with different capacities for learning, and that we all have different capacities to learn.","i don't think it's true that all people have the same ability to learn, but i do think it is true that some people have a higher capacity to learn than others.","i agree with you, but i don't think it's a good idea to assume that all humans are born with the same capacity for learning."
563,"i don't believe in love or monogamy, so among many people like me, the purpose of marriage is for raising kids, having a primary companion, and passing inheritance. however, you can do all of those things without marriage. you can live with a with a cohabiting partner for life, have kids, and specify your partner kids in a will. however, for cohabiting parents, either party can leave with less consequences than divorce. most of the consequences of divorce also apply to the separation of cohabiting parents. however, for a divorce, you must also pay legal fees. in my view, this is the primary difference between cohabiting parents and married parents. this is an important difference because relationships have ups and downs. inevitably, you'll have conflicts with your partner and you'll be tempted to divorce separate. however, if you have the costs of divorce to dissuade you from divorcing, you're more likely to stay together longer and work through the conflicts. in other words, marriage gives you a second chance at keeping your relationship intact in a situation where you would've separated had you not been married. the corollary is that in situations where individuals cannot marry e. g. gay marriage , all you need is a third party arbitrator to impose fines on you if you separate, then you'll have the primary benefit of marriage.", The primary purpose of marriage is to act as a barrier to separation when you otherwise would've separated,"i don't believe in love or monogamy, but i do believe in the purpose of marriage. if you want to have kids, you have to have a partner. you can't have kids without a partner, but you can have kids with a cohabiting partner.","i think the primary purpose of marriage is to keep your relationship intact. if you are married to someone who is not married to you, then you have the right to divorce them.","i don't believe in marriage, but i do believe that it is a good thing.","i don't believe in love or monogamy, but i do believe that marriage is a good thing."

2102,"i believe that in general, america is a better place for a person to live than western europe if the following two conditions are met 1. you have a valuable, marketable skill that makes you employable 2. you are responsible with your money here is some data that i am basing this off of. relevant text: us white collar workers were in 2012 better paid than their colleagues in the rest of the world. median wage earned by american managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals is the highest in the world. the best paid colleagues overseas, who usually live in europe receive about 5 per hour less when adjusted for the purchasing power parity. so, the general sentiment that i see on reddit is that western europe is a much better place to live than america because of all the social programs they have there healthcare, college, etc. . i don t think that this tells the whole story, and in fact i believe that with the right skill set and financial responsibility america can be a much better place to live than countries like germany, sweden, or the u. k. generally speaking, most of the problems that people talk about in america boil down to a lack of money. unexpected healthcare costs don t typically ruin people financially if they have a job that gives them good health insurance and they have prepared for such an emergency accordingly. if a person is a skilled worker and can find a good job, then usually these things aren t an issue. but in exchange, you generally are paid a higher salary in the u. s. than an equivalent job in europe, and that extra money goes a long way to increase your quality of life. i feel that this is the key thing that people miss in the america vs. europe debate. europeans balk at some of the expensive things they hear about in the u. s. , but the fact that we are paid significantly higher here is rarely acknowledged. of course, there are a ton of factors that could also affect your decision like where your family lives or what kind of weather you like, but i think that all other things being equal, you can live a better life in america as a skilled, responsible person than you can in europe. i feel that europe is only better for unskilled laborers or those who cannot responsibly budget their money. i m interested in having a discussion so cmv!"," America is a better place to live than Western Europe for skilled, responsible workers",i don't think it's fair to say that america is a better place for a person to live than western europe if the following two conditions are met,i don't think it's fair to say that america is a better place to live than western europe. it's not fair to assume that europe is better than the rest of the world.,i think you're missing the point. you're right that america is better for unskilled workers than western europe is for skilled workers.,"i think you're missing a key point here. i think it's important to note that a lot of people don't think that america is a better place for a person to live than the rest of the world. it's not just about the money, it's also about the quality of life. if you're a skilled, responsible person, you can live a better life in america than you can in europe."

1703,"currently, to report social security disability benefits fraud, the person who reports the suspected fraud needs to provide their ss number. the reason the government wants you to provide your information is because the burden of proof is on the accuser. if the accusation is not true, the accuser can be charged with making a false accusation. the government also claims that the person you accuse will not be notified who reported them. on the reason explanation, the burden of proof should not be on the accuser. under the current system, you are not allowed to report suspicious activity. if an accuser's neighbor receives disability for a bad back, and sees him doing yard work and playing golf, the accuser can not know 100 that he is committed fraud. however, the accuser can make a judgment that something does not seem right, and the accuser would like the government to take a look. this is not unreasonable. from the s. s website gt; typically you would have to know someone quite well in order to determine whether or not he or she is taking advantage of the system. if you know someone as well as s. s wants you to, the accuser would need to practically live with the accused. the burden of proof is too high, and the punishments for false accusations are too strong. on the latter, i cannot see why or how this is true. it may not be the procedure to release the information to the accused, but if it goes to court, it has to be part of the discovery. there will be the information of the accuser in the government files, and if the accused fought hard enough he will get it. however, if the accused really cannot know who accused them, why demand the information at all. the benefits of staying anonymous is obvious. someone sees someone committing fraud, reports it to the proper authorities, and goes about their lives with 0 concern. my current situation is i work with someone who's husband collects disability for disease. he is a drug user, in a motorcycle gang, and works an under the table job that pays him good money. the wife i work with makes over 80k per year. i do not know the disability laws, i am not sure if what this guy is doing is fraud, but it seems to me that someone should take a closer look at this guy. but if i am wrong, what happens to me? i face charges? will his wife find out via our workplace than the s. s office is charging me, than tell her 1 husband about? it is not worth my risks", You should be able to report disability fraud anonymously,"the problem with the system is that it's not the person who reports the fraud. it's the people who report the fraud, not the government.","i think the problem with this is that it's not the government's fault. the problem is that the government doesn't want to know who the accuser is. they don't want the accuser to know that the person they are accusing of fraud is lying. they want the person to know the person who is lying to them. if the person lied to them, they would be charged with lying to the government. if they lied to the people they are accused of lying to, then they","the problem with this is that it is not the burden of proof on the accuser, it is the burden on the accused.","i agree with you, but i don't think it's fair to force someone to provide their information to the government."
133,"i'm sure many people herein either have depression, know someone that has it, or generally knows what it is because of how common it is. it's a has the ability to be a tremendously debilitating disorder that sometimes needs electroconvulsive therapy shocking the brain to a sometimes seizure inducing state . while the same therapy can be done for treatment resistant mania at times, i believe that should be avoided until the mania calls for it. this is due to the very nature of what mania is. amp; x200b; mania is part of bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic depressive disorder. i think the later made more sense, but that's irrelevant. it's easy to think of mania as the opposite of depression, wherein you become so happy that you are a danger to yourself and or others. as my username implies, i know a lot about drugs. i have done a lot of drugs as well. however, nothing i've ever done can synthetically replicate the natural happiness that comes with mania. amp; x200b; the most common newest treatment for depression to my knowledge is currently ssris snris. this stands for selective serotonin and or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. what this essentially does in layman terms is let these little happy chemicals in our brain do their job more efficiently than they otherwise would via staying where they work longer, rather than being transported into where they are eventually ready to take off again. however, with bipolar disorder, you also have to medicate the mania. this used to frequently be done with lithium, which is an alkali metal, however, due to the tolls it can take on the body, it is not as commonly used anymore, at least from my understanding. now, we typically use a typical antipsychotics. what these tend to do is block the receptor sites for dopamine and or serotonin. in layman terms, they still let the happy chemicals do their jobs to an extent, but the medicine thwarts their productivity. this is a method that can treat both depression and mania simultaneously. however, given what the different medicines do comes part of the problem. ssris snris are not what agonists, which are synthetic happy chemicals, you merely have a more efficient happy chemicals working. however, this doesn't increase your overall happiness to the extent that you are happy, rather it stops making you feel sad. this leads many individuals who take ssris snris to feel apathetic at times. however, with mania specifically, we still have plenty of happy chemicals doing their job to the extent allowed. this can inadvertently lead to a general, natural, feeling of happiness, whereas the aforementioned medicine typically does not. amp; x200b; now, i'm currently diagnosed as bipolar, and i'm currently manic. my psychiatrist is currently trying to up my medicine, as this mania is making be very happy. to be happy, i like arguments. i love being right and i love being proven wrong and learning something. however, this has recently become a problem wherein i'm asking too many questions in college and thinking too in depth with the given work i'm assigned. however, i feel very fortunate that i am able to have this level of happiness. the alternative of only being able to be sad to a medically noteworthy extent sounds a lot worse to me. yet, for some reason bipolar disorder is often considered to be a worse disorder, and i'm not really sure why that is."," When medicated, mania is a lot better than depression.","i don't know if you've ever heard of mania, but i think it's important to note that it's not the same thing as bipolar disorder. bipolar disorder is not a disorder. it's a disorder that is caused by a combination of factors, including depression, anxiety, depression, and anxiety. it is a disorder caused by the combination of these factors, which is why it's called mania. the problem with mania is that it can be caused by multiple factors","i don't think it's a good idea to treat mania, but i think it should be avoided.",i don't think it's a good idea to use a drug to treat mania.,"i think it's important to note that there are two different types of depression. the first is depression and the second is mania. depression is the opposite of depression, but it's not the same as mania either. mania is a mental illness that is caused by a lack of serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. the second type of depression is called mania, and it's caused by the lack of dopamine and serotonin in the brain."

740,"what i mean is: rocket league is the game with the highest potential for attracting viewers on tournaments out of all games out there. now for the explanation. imo, in order to be a successful sport, e sports included, a game needs 3 things: its core concept needs to be easy to understand, it must have competition, and it must be watchable. let's begin with the core concept. the core concept for most sports can be explained in a minute darts, soccer, basketball, etc. for rocket league, that is also really true it's soccer with cars, that's basically it. that means that a new viewer can tune in to a game, look at it for 10 seconds, understand what's going on, and stay. compared to a game like, for example, poker, where you really need to take some time to explain who and how wins the game. such ease to understand is really unique to rocket league in my opinion, and that's a part of what makes me think it can be really successful as an e sport. rocket league has basically no interference from chance the game is as symmetric as a game can be. thus, every good move, every goal, is an achievement of the players, so it is one of the most competition friendly computer games out there. not that it's the place where rl shines although it's an improvement over chess, dota, go, lol and all other not symmetric games , but still it's really important. and third, watchability. there are some games that are really unwatchable. like chess it takes 3 4 hours to play one game of professional chess, and it's often a best of a lot series, with a lot of games, and it can take all weekend to play. the current top e sports, cs:go, dota and lol, require attention spans of about half an hour one hour, which is also the attention span that a traditional sport like soccer requires. rocket league games are 5 minutes of constant action, with about a couple minute break between games in a series, allowing people to tune in during a lunch break and watch a game, and then continue on their way. a best of five series lasts about as long as a best of three series in lol, which makes it not too short for the more engaged players too. this is also really unique to rocket league, and, i believe, makes it really good at appealing to the most casual, and thus the biggest, audiences out there. to change my view, i believe you would need to bring up a problem rocket league has that no other currently major sport or e sport does, one that would make growing as an e sport much harder for rocket league.", Rocket League is the best e-sport out there.,"i think you're missing the point of rocket league, which is that it's a game with the highest potential for attracting viewers on tournaments out of all games out there.","rocket league is the best e-sport out there. it's the best of all e sports out there because it's easy to understand, it's fun to play, and it's a lot of fun to watch.","i think it's important to note that rocket league is not an e sport. it's an e sports game. e sports are not e sports, but they are e sports.","i think you're missing a key point here. i think it's important to note that a lot of e sports are very different from e sports. e sports have a very different set of rules and rules than e sports, and e sports tend to have a much more complex set of regulations and rules. i don't think you can argue that e sports can be a very successful e sport, but i think e sports should be a good e sport. i would argue that it's"

36,"so, for starters, i have done a lot of drugs in my lifetime. i've copped heroin from slums, pet the furry wall on acid, and even have gone psychotic a few times. in my eyes, drugs are a tool just like any other. you can use a chainsaw to carve a beautiful sculpture of a pair of peregrine falcons in their neck breaking mating ritual, or you can use it to chop up little timmy from down the lane. it all depends on how you use them. i certainly am no stranger to the perils of drugs use. i've been hospitalized, ostracized, and penalized. but still i continue. i have had friends die. watched them go blue. i've seen loved ones let their addiction take precedence over me. i've been the victim of theft. i've made bad decisions. so why do i think drugs should be legal? simple. regulation makes things safer. can you imagine a world where cars did not have regulation? where our food did not have regulation? i've been to china, and let me tell you, lack of food regulation is a hell of a fucking thing. right now, a lack of drug regulation is killing people. heroin is being replaced by unknown analogues of fentanyl and people are dying because they don't know how much of what they're taking. you could argue it's their fault. that they deserve it for choosing to inject these drugs. and maybe there is some truth in that, but it's a harsh stance to take. a very simplified and easy to pass off stance. when people overdose, they die. these are everyday people dying. they may like the same sports teams you do, or play the same videogames, watch the same shows, eat at the same restaurants. and here they are dying. families weep. the hearts of emts everywhere either harden or sink. it is fucking tragic. in the last decade, opioid overdoses in america have risen by 500 due to the introduction of fentanyl analogues into this unregulated market. if we sold pure, regulated heroin, we would lose a lot of these overdoses. will access maybe mean more addicts? probably. but i would rather have more addicts and less deaths. i mean, people aren't dying because they want to die. they aren't committing suicide. they're dying by accident. maybe they wanted to push the limit. maybe their tolerance was low. i don't know, and it doesn't matter. if we can stop these accidental deaths, we will accomplish the main thing i think any civilization should have as it's number one priority keeping it's citizens alive. i also believe that the purchase of these drugs should be limited by age and license. the license being a drug license to that particular class of drugs. at least for the more dangerous stuff. there should be regulated classes that teach people on the ins and outs of these drugs. what side effects to look for. what dose to do. how to properly do things like inject. as a drug user, it is hard to explain the extent of ignorance among other drug users. i have always tried to keep relatively informed by doing my own research. when i've fucked up, i at least knew what i was doing. but there are so many out there who don't know. they don't test their drugs. they don't care about drugs. they just do drugs blindly, and then they suffer for it. it's very dangerous. we need to keep people safe and alive and happy. don't think anybody would disagree with that last sentence, we may just have different ideas on how to accomplish it."," All drugs should be legal and regulated.

668,"hi there! i've been a lurker for a bit and this is a my first post here, so happy to receive feedback as well on how able i am on expressing my views. anyway, many if not most people in the social justice movement have the viewpoint that the historically oppressed such as blacks cannot be racist. this stems from their definition of racism where they believe it requires systemic power of others to be racist. this in itself is not a problem, as they argue that these oppressed people can be prejudiced based on skin color as well. they just don't use the word 'racist'. the problem, however, lies in the fact that literally everyone else outside this group has learned defined racism as something along the lines of 'prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. ' google whatever their source is , merriam webster, and oxford all have similar definitions which don't include the power aspect that these people define as racism. thus, there is a fundamental difference between how a normal person defines racism and how a social justice warrior defines racism, even though in most cases, they mean and are arguing the same exact point. when these people claim in shorthand things like 'black people can't be racist! ' there is fundamental misunderstanding between what the writer is saying and what the reader is interpreting. this misinterpretation is usually only solvable through extended discussion but at that point the damage is already done. everyone thinks these people are lunatics who want to permanently play the victim card and absolve themselves from any current or future wrongdoing. this viewpoint is exacerbated with the holier than thou patronizing attitude tone that many of these people take or convey. twitter examples: hayes status 778803492043448321 i took these examples from a similar cmv post that argues that blacks can be racist the idea that people of colour cannot be this type of preaching of 'blacks can't be racist! ' completely alienates people who may have been on the fence regarding the movement, gives further credibility ammunition to the opposition, and gives power to people that actually do take advantage of victimizing themselves, while the actual victims are discred all because of some stupid semantic difference on how people define racism. ultimately, the movement should drop this line of thinking because the consequences far outweigh whatever benefits it brings. in fact, what actual benefit is there to go against the popular definition and defining racism as prejudice power? i genuinely cannot think of one. it just seems like an arbitrary change. i now understand that the use of the definition academically and regarding policies is helpful since they pertain to systems as a whole."," Arguing that historically oppressed people such as blacks cannot be racist only fuels further animosity towards the social justice movement, regardless of intentions.",i don't think it's a problem. i think it is a problem that the movement is trying to change. it's trying to make the movement more inclusive and more inclusive.,"i think the problem is that the social justice movement should drop the idea that historically oppressed people such as blacks cannot be racist. it's not that they can't be racist, it's just that they don't have the power to do so.","i think the problem with the term 'racism' is that it is used to refer to a group of people who are oppressed, and not to refer specifically to the group. it is not meant to be used as a slur, but as a way of saying that people of color can be racist.","i think you're missing the point here. i think it's important to note that a lot of people in the social justice movement don't use the word 'racism' when they're talking about people of colour. i don't think that's a problem, but i do think that it is a problem when people use the term to describe people of color."

1853,"i just can't get on board with einstein's theory of relativity. i understand and can follow the maths. that's not the problem. i think that the whole thing rests upon the single assumption that the observed speed of light ie even the same beam or particle of light is the same for all observers regardless of their frame of reference. i just cannot believe this because it is so counter intuitive. for me or i think for anyone to believe such an 'out there' claim it would need very good evidence and after years of searching i have not found or been presented with anything that i think amounts to good evidence for that proposition. the evidence i have seen generally falls into three categories, being: 1. things that are just wrong. for example, people often quote the gps system as proof of relativity, saying that gps would not be able to work without adjustments for relativity. this is just incorrect. this website explains it quite well: this is intuitively correct. your car or iphone does not have an atomic clock in it the relative difference in speeds between the satellites and your car or phone are immaterial. we know that clocks run slower when they get into lesser gravity and or when they go faster , so they amend the clocks so that they 'tick' at a different rate before they send the satellites up. this is just to keep the clock times in space close as possible to our time on etc ground. if they didn't do this, it wouldn't make any difference to the gps system, provided the satellites were in roughly the same gravity and speeds as each other, i. e. the only thing that is necessary is that the clocks in the various satellites are consistent; 2. things that are not convincing. i remain unconvinced that we can carry out experiments that measure the speed of light with enough accuracy to be sure of the results. i have seen experiments that seem to support the constant speed of light thing and others that do not. galileo tried to measure the speed of light by having him and a mate stand on hills a couple of miles apart and flash lantern at each other. it turned out that they were just measuring their reflexes their reflexes were orders of maginude greater than the actual speed of light. i remain unconvinced that we currently have equipment that can accurately measure that the speed of light is constant for all reference frames; 3. things that are just indirect evidence but which are held up as being proof . this is where people tend to say that einstein's predictions have come true, so therefore the basic assumption about constant speed of light must be true. i don't think this logically makes sense. it's a non sequitur. some examples are the gps thing above, or that light bends as it goes around planets. again, why isn't it expected that light would be drawn to planets by gravity, without relativity having to be true? people's answer to this is that the exact angle of bend is exactly as einstein predicted. well, even if that's true i'm still not happy with the evidence being enough to go with constant speed of light for all reference frames. also, the accuracy of our instruments comes into question again. another one is that we haven't been able to accelerate anything to over the speed of light. again, that doesn't prove anything; and 4. the other dumb thing i hear, when i question how we know the speed of light is constant for all reference frames, is that 'it just is'. as if i'm supposed to be convinced by that. so, i just can't say i believe this theory based on the evidence that i have seen to date. however, i'm more than happy to be convinced but, i'm warning you, i'm a good skeptic i'll need some pretty convincing evidence . cheers riley", I'm unconvinced by Einstein's relativity,i don't think you can get on board with einstein's theory of relativity.,"i don't believe in einstein's theory of relativity, but i do believe that there is a way to measure the speed of light. i don't think that the gps system is the best way to do this.",i don't think it's a good idea to say that the speed of light is constant for all reference frames.,i don't think it's true that the speed of light is constant for all reference frames. it's just that we don't know how fast it is.
1592,"so i've been thinking recently about how advertisers track users online and how some people show concern while others don't really care about that. as an i. t. professional, data privacy and security are of upmost importance in the modern world. as more of our lives are conducted digitally, it is critical for consumers to understand how and why companies use their personal data so that consumers can make educated decisions with their digital life. the reason i'm bringing this up is because i can see the intersection of two things, digital privacy, the right to withhold information about ones digital life , and personal autonomy, the right to self governance of ones body without influence or coercion . let me explain. people who advocate for personal autonomy make the argument that people have a right to exercise freedom to make decisions relating to a body without coercion. this is the fundamental premise that defends consensual sex and informed consent for medical procedures. as for digital autonomy, individuals are believed to have a right to choose how their data is used by software and services. this idea that people have an right to online privacy is often the backbone behind the creation of privacy policies. so what i am saying is that since there are many parallels between digital privacy and bodily personal autonomy, people should treat their online lives as an extension of their personal lives. if people don't take charge of their online privacy, then corporations and governments will take advantage them. likewise, if a person doesn't take steps to protect their bodily personal autonomy, then they risk getting coerced into doing things that isn't in their best interest. the common theme that i see between digital privacy and bodily personal autonomy is exercising control over ones life.", People who care about bodily/personal autonomy should also care about digital privacy.,"i think you're missing the point. i don't think it's a good idea to have a data privacy policy, but i think it is a good thing to have one. if you want to be able to make informed decisions about what you do with your data, you need to have the right to do so.",i don't think it's a good idea to treat your online life as an extension of your personal autonomy.,"i think you're missing the point. if you want to know what happens to your body, you need to know about it.","i think it's important to understand what you're talking about. i think you're missing the point here. i don't think it is a good idea to use the word 'privacy' to describe what it means to have a right to privacy. it's not a bad idea, but it's a very important thing to be aware of. i'm not going to go into all the details, but i'm going to try to give you an idea of what privacy means."
321,"in the u. s. , i believe drivers should be re tested on traffic laws and be required to pass a written and physical driving test every ten years to prove they are capable of driving on the road in a safe manner. there are 40,000 auto fatalities a year. everyday driving i can see people on their cell phones, failing to move over for emergency vehicles, cruising in the left lanes of highways, or going significantly below or above the posted speed limit. all states are different in renewing a drivers license but to my knowledge no state requires a renewal of driving ability or knowledge of the laws. some licenses are good for a few years and states like arizona last until their 65th birthday. most renewal processes are a general vision test and new photo id. there are several benefits to re testing drivers. for one, traffic laws are constantly being updated for safety and technology and unless people pay strict attention to the news, it s likely most people don t know about new laws being implemented. safety is another reason. not just for the driver being tested but the other people they share a road with. if national auto accidents and fatalities decline, auto insurance rates would be cheaper. there would be more tax money being generated because people would have to pay to be re take a drivers test, which would also open up more job opportunities at the dmv creating jobs. police are cracking down hard on alcohol related driving for safety, however alcohol related fatalities accounted for 28 of fatalities in 2016. focusing on 100 of the problem would lead to fewer accidents, fewer deaths, lower insurance rates, and traffic in general would improve.", Drivers should be required to re-take a driving (DMV) test every 10 years,i don't think it's a good idea to require drivers to pass a written and physical driving test every ten years to prove they are capable of driving on the road.,i don't think it's a good idea to have a driver test every ten years.,"i don't think this is a good idea, but i think it's worth considering.","i agree with you, but i don't think it's a good idea to have a drivers test every ten years to prove that you are capable of driving on the road in a safe manner."
349,"the title does not equal my 100 literal view, so let me elaborate. i do think it s a big deal if a species that plays an important role in an ecosystem goes extinct. therefore, for ecological reasons, there are many species that are very very important to protect i m no ecologist, but bees are probably a good example i do think it s morally preferable for humans to minimize their footprint on the planet, and avoid contributing to any extinctions when possible i do care about the environment, i am extremely concerned about climate change, and i hate poaching. i hate all hunting that s done just out of sport, and i m vegetarian. i dislike the causes of extinction, but the extinction itself isn t as bad as people think i don t think it s inherently bad if a species goes extinct from natural causes, even if humans may have played some part considering that humans are a natural result of and contributor to the earth s ecosystem . now i ll explain the logic behind my current view: a species is comprised only of individuals, so the death of a species is really just the death of individual animals, which is nothing new. if a zebra dies, it doesn t care whether there are any more zebras around after it. the death of the last zebra is just as tragic as the death of the 1000th to last. it s not like there s a giant avatar for the species that keels over dead when the last one dies. species just means a certain type of animal . animals are living and dying all the time. it makes sense to be sad when an animal dies, but it doesn t make sense to be sad when a species dies. species is a classification, not a living thing. when a species goes extinct, a better way to think of it is this type of animal will not be born anymore . if the idea of that makes you sad, it means you re feeling emotions about theoretical future animals, not actual animals. when a species dies, it s like god is switching from yes, more zebras will be born in the future theoretically to no, no more zebras will be born. this is different than killing a real animal. theoretical animals don t matter, they never existed in the first place. some people say imagine if my kids grow up and never see a polar bear because they all die out i could never forgive myself for letting my generation ruin the planet. now, i do think climate change will be a seriously huge problem, but i disagree with the whole polar bears thing. for one, nobody gets that much satisfaction from the existence of polar bears. how much time do people really spend looking at real polar bears in a zoo? the number of species alive today is a tiny fraction of all the species that have ever lived the vast majority of them have gone extinct. are you depressed that you ll never get to see any of those extinct animals you see in books, like a wooly mammoth? i would love to see one, but i recognize that it s not actually something important, it would just be a fun novelty. if our kids grew up without polar bears, they would see a picture of them on google and say oh cool, it s like a bear but white and then they d get on with their day. all species will die at some point, even ours. the collection of species that were alive when we were born is just a random assortment that happened to overlap with our birth. species are constantly going extinct, and new species are constantly evolving as well. if we try to put our foot down and and say all right, every species alive right now is gonna stay alive for as long as humans? than you re trying to control something out of your control. the natural cycle of life involves old species dying out so new ones can take their place. if polar bears die out, it will change the ecosystem, which will result in changes to future generations of surviving species. as a direct result of the polar bear s extinction, a new animal could evolve that becomes the number one favorite species of future humans. i think it s tragic for an animal to be killed unnecessarily because of poachers, or pollution, or habitat loss, but when the last animal of a species dies, it s just one more animal. it s almost selfish how humans say i like this species, i want to keep it around for my enjoyment i will be quite cross if they go away! as a final disclaimer, i think there are a couple exceptions; obviously if something like dogs or cats went extinct, it would suck for humans. we want to keep those around for our kids. sorry for the length!", It’s not a “big deal” if a species goes extinct.,"i don't think it's a big deal if a species goes extinct from natural causes, but it's not a huge deal if it goes extinct because of natural causes.","i don't think it's a big deal if a species goes extinct from natural causes, but it's not a huge deal if the species dies from environmental causes.",i think it's a good idea to think about it in a different way.,i don't think it's a big deal if a species goes extinct from natural causes.
574,"hear me out here. fair enough, here we go. we can observe that throughout history, social, cultural and technological progress is only achieved when a population has enough resources so that a large enough number of them don't have to work. or at least not manually. let's call these people the idle rich. like it or not, these are your artists, or at least their patrons, your authors, philosophers and thinkers. now this condition requires a certain amount of resources which until we get robots at least requires that the population receive more resources than its members could produce, given their desired living standard. if there is a low living standard, it is unlikely that an intellectual class will arise. thus a living standard must be satisfied for all, then a particularly high living standard needs to arise for the idle rich. this means that, given the expected living standard, the society is unable to internally produce enough resources to sustain itself. thus what is required is the exploitation of a less developed society. this society will have lower standards and thus the capacity for the required resource production. it will also be vulnerable to conquest. now, to sustain development, a society must leech off resources for now off a population less advanced. this beneficial to the colonising country for obvious reasons the colonised country who's citizens will often be treated better, as the society which exploits them tends to be more socially advanced and even after the colonisation, this social progress will prevail consider the treatment of people in former british colonies and note how they're more democratic and individualistic than their neighbours . it also brings advancements in tech and culture and for humanity as it achieves technological, philosophical and economic progress . thus colonialism is in fact beneficial for everyone.", Colonialism is Desirable,"i think you're missing the point of colonialism, which is that it's not the only way to develop a society. it's the way to create a society, and it's a way to build a society that is not the way you want it to be. if you want to make a society more developed, you have to create one that is more developed than you want.","the problem with colonialism is that it is not beneficial for everyone. it is beneficial for a lot of people, but it is also beneficial for some people.",i don't think it's a good idea to use the term 'colonisation' to refer to the idea that the colonisation of the world is beneficial for all.,"i think you're missing the point here. i think it's important to point out that a society is not a society. it's a society that is a society of people who are not able to produce enough resources to sustain itself. it is not just a society, it's also a society where people are able to make a living."
1047,"definitions materialism a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental aspects and consciousness, are results of material interactions consciousness condition : despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is. for the sake of this argument, we'll just say that this is the ability to experience qualia argument materialism implies that the experience of consciousness is, like everything else, a result of physical processes. in order for a machine to experience consciousness, all that is necessary is for it to be a collection of matter regardless of its method of assembly which is composed of and arranged in the appropriate way as to produce this experience. as the method of assembly is not relevant to its existence, the fact that it is 'artificial' or 'manmade' is irrelevant to its capacity to have these experiences. put another way, materialism reduces the term 'artificial intelligence' to 'intelligence', making the claim 'a sufficiently complex intelligence is capable of consciousness'. finally, humans exist, possess intelligence, and are conscious. therefore, if materialism is assumed to be true and humans exist, sufficiently complex artificial intelligence is capable of consciousness. disclaimer i'm going to back the intention and not the wording of my claim loopholes in semantics won't earn a delta. bonus claim my belief on this claim has changed a materialist who believes murder is unethical must also believe it's unethical to delete a sufficiently complex computer program. seeing as this isn't the titular claim, i won't award deltas for this but i'm open to a discussion on the topic", If materialism is true then a sufficiently complex artificial intelligence is capable of consciousness.,"i think you're missing the point of materialism, which is to say that there is a fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental aspects and consciousness, are results of material interactions. i don't think this is true, but i think it's important to note that materialism is not a form of philosophical monism. it's not that there isn't materialism but that there's a fundamental materialism that is based on materialism. for example, i",the problem with materialism is that it assumes that there is a sufficiently complex artificial intelligence is capable of consciousness. the problem with this is that materialism assumes that the existence of consciousness is a result of physical processes. this is not the case. there is no such thing as an artificial intelligence. it is a collection of matter that is composed of material elements and arranged in the appropriate way as to produce this experience. the only way to prove this is to prove that it is true.,"i think you're missing the point. if you're a materialist and you believe that consciousness is a collection of matter, then you're wrong.",i think you're missing a key point here. i think it's important to note that the definition of 'artificial intelligence' doesn't necessarily mean that it's true or not. it's just that it doesn't mean that you're capable of consciousness. it just means that you are capable of being able to experience consciousness.
905,"my time on r menslib, interest in linguistics, and agreement with anti patriarchal movements which i ll refer to as feminism hereafter have prompted the following idea: thesis through poor or radical misuse, the phrase toxic mascuilinity is now associated with the idea that masculinity, at large, is detrimental to others and should be remediated. this warping of meaning mimics the misuse of the friend zone , which i believe traditionally described the uncomfortable space that people largely men exisit in when romantic feelings are not reciprocated. as a result, it is prudent to update the phrase toxic masculinity to something more accurate perhaps toxic aspects of masculinity as we have done to describe feelings of unrequited romance rationale toxic masculinity has, to my knowledge, historically been used to describe the behaviors of men that are damaging to everyone involved. in my more recent cursory research into how different groups of men and women use and understand the phrase, i noticed that there were reasonable arguments that toxic masculinity describes the idea of masculinity as caustic. people with that view instead opt to divide common masculine behaviors into their toxic and non toxic counterparts. r menslib has a much bettee breakdown of these distinctions in their sidebar, but an example of such a distinction would be the difference between resiliance and stoicism. this reasoning seemed analagous to arguments i have seen in opposition of using the phrase the friend zone . although the idea behind the phrase is reasonable, a critical mass of people largely men abusing or using the phrase in bad faith has caused the phrase friend zone to be viewed with warrented suspicion. my understanding of the updated, good faith description of the friend zone is an acknowledgement of that state of tension, coupled with caveats on how not to interpret that tension. i m not wed to the idea that toxic mascunity must be updated. at the same time, i can t see any strong arguments why the phrase, as is, is neither similar to the friend zone in its history nor similarly insufficent to describe the relavent meanings. delta worthy arguments arguments that demonstrate a fundamental difference between the history and usage of these phrases, which invalidates similar treatment arguments that successfully argue that the phrase toxic masculinity is sufficiently unambiguous and descriptive in its current lay usage as is, while also explaining what is lacking in the phrase friend zone caveats amp; considerations 1. feminism is a philosophical umbrella, so i have intentionally given a vague definition for it. i am not looking for answers that quibble over a definition of feminism except those definitions within which toxic masculinity has non semantically different meaning 2. the friend zone is a phrase marred with similar difficulties in pinning down a definition. for the purposes of this cmv, the working definition of the friend zone presumes that it was, at one point, more appropriate to use than it is now"," “Toxic Masculinity” has experienced a similar decline in connotation as “The Friend Zone”, and should be updated in its usage in like fashion","i think you're missing the point of the term toxic mascuilinity. the term is used to describe a group of men who are not attracted to each other. it's used to refer to people who are attracted to one another, or who have a relationship with someone who is attracted to them, or to someone who has a romantic relationship with them. the phrase is used as a way to describe the relationship between men and women, and it's a way of describing the relationship","i don't think the phrase 'toxic' mascuilinity should be updated, but i think it should be.","i don't think the phrase 'toxic masculinity' should be used to refer to masculinity, but i think it's a good idea to change the meaning of the phrase.","i think it's important to note that the phrase toxic mascuilinity is not the same as the friend zone. it's the same thing as the 'friend zone' in that it's used to refer to a group of people who are not attracted to each other, but who are attracted to one another."

310,"i believe that laws mandating that a woman wear a hijab are morally equivalent to laws mandating a woman wear a shirt but differences in culture make many in the west feel like one is oppression and the other is natural. i'm not addressing the religious side of this i am merely pointing out that judgement discomfort that many westerners have toward mandating the hijab is unjustified, because our rules on women's dress aren't that different. both are cultural mores written into law, based on the idea that women s bodies are dangerously evocative to men and in bad taste to display. all of the discussion i ve heard about women and toplessness, and all the reasons women prefer not to go topless, sound similar to discussion around women wearing hijab. for example, women shouldn t go topless because men would be distracted by seeing their breasts and can t help being turned on, that s a private part of the body that s just for your partner husband to see, and it insults him to to show your breasts to other men, women going topless are promiscuous, it would harm children to see a woman s naked breasts even though most children see their mother s breasts in childhood , it s fine to be topless around other women at a gym, spa, changing room but if a man happens to be around it s a huge violation. when i ve proposed this idea in the past, people have told me it s different because the breasts are sexual but they re not involved in sex, just breastfeeding, so i don t believe that argument holds up. also the idea that the reason is because women have breasts but men don t doesn t hold water as a counterargument because that doesn t have anything to do with morality and women s faces and bodies have many other differences than men s, so an argument about men s and women s differences to me suggests that even more of a woman s body should be covered, no? many people in western culture are uncomfortable about the idea of a hijab, but fail to see that the west also has restrictions on women s dress based on similar reasoning. those cultural ideas are so ingrained that it s impossible to see the irony of arguing that a hijab is morally wrong but that covering breasts is morally right, or natural. western ideas of natural vs unnatural might feel right to westerners, but it s because of the culture we ve been steeped in. societies that mandate each of these rules are just drawing the line in a different place.", Laws mandating that women wear a hijab are morally equivalent to laws mandating women wear shirts,i don't think it's fair to say that a woman wearing a hijab is morally equivalent to laws mandating a woman wear a shirt but differences in culture make many in the west feel like one is oppression and the other is natural.,i don't think it's morally equivalent to laws forcing women to wear shirts.,i don't think it's fair to say that women should be forced to cover their breasts.,"i don't think it's fair to say that a hijab is morally wrong, but i do think it is fair to point out that there is a difference between a hijab and a shirt."
2187,"by free market, i mean the idea that, assuming perfect competition, a free market economy would be allocatively efficient efficiency . by sustainable, i mean that, assuming the market stats of perfect, it will remain perfect in the long run. not about environmental sustainability. by perfect, i mean that the market fulfill a number of conditions competition idealizing conditions of perfect competition , in particular: a large number of buyers and sellers my background: econ 101 and 102 let's say there are 1000 sellers in a market. all sellers starts with the same amount of capital customer base, but with they are running with different efficiency. those that runs an efficient shop would make profit, and those that cannot won't. one by one, the least efficient shops are dropped off the market due to healthy competition. after a while, there are only few sellers left, let's say less than 5. now the condition 'a large number of buyers and sellers' is not fulfilled anymore, and the market is not perfect anymore. therefore, a perfect market is not sustainable. i think i have an empirical backup for this. there are many market which takes the form of either monopoly or oligopoly. oligopolistic markets include aircraft manufacturing, crrating, processed food and drinks, confectionery, cpu chip sets, graphic card, and os monopolistic market includes microsoft, monsanto, walt disney, and google examples of monopolies i'm not sure if there's a solution i would be very interested to hear one , i'm simply saying that 'free market is not sustainable'.", Free market is not sustainable,"i'm not sure what you mean by 'perfect competition', but i think you're missing the point. if a market is perfect, then it's not sustainable. if it's perfect competition, then the market is not sustainable, and the market isn't sustainable.","i don't think it's sustainable to have a perfect market, but i think you're missing the point. if a market is perfect, then it's not sustainable.",i think you're missing the point. free markets are not sustainable in the long run.,i don't think it's sustainable to say that a free market is not sustainable.
