       "      <td>If public schools are truly focused on giving students a foundation for their futures, public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a major part of the base curriculum. : final post due to past technical glitches. this topic will only appear this final time. disclaimer: as it says at the end of the post, the use of math and english as examples is not specific. if you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . the opinion being presented here is just that room should be made in the base curriculum for the science of emotion and mental health. also, i m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. i m not talking about teaching kids a few basic social skills. we experience our entire existence through our minds, and the chemical and electrical signals going off in our brain largely dictate what experiences we have, how those experiences feel to us, and how we react to them. mental health and emotion is an enormous scientific field which can potentially encompass the entirety of that human experience, which leads to the simple question: how is such a massive field, one that influences so much of what human beings do, not being taught to some extent in our society as a core requirement? core subjects like science, math, and history are similarly large, and obviously can't ever be taught in full to students in a matter of only twelve years, which is why paid professionals spend so much time and money deciding what to teach, when to teach it, and how. none of that implementation, however, is necessary to establish before first accepting that schools should teach the subject as a major part of the base curriculum. i'm asserting that they should. a student gaining substantial knowledge on the science of emotion and mental health is far more likely to be important for their life after school ends than knowing how to find the base of a triangle or where to place the semicolon in a sentence. mental health affects literally everything in a person's life to a much greater extent than most things taught in public schools. productivity, stability, cooperation, families and relationships are all greatly dependent on having a healthy understanding of one's own perceptions and emotions and emotional reactions and an understanding of how perceptions, emotions and emotional reactions work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . i've mentioned this opinion to people in the past and many people try to argue mistakenly, in my opinion that teaching mental health and emotion should be the parents' responsibility. this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on the subjects of mental health and emotion because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. if anything, based on that logic, it would make more sense to have the parents teach math and english and have the schools teach subjects of mental health. i don't agree with that logic, though. the only idea i'm officially presenting here is that public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a main part of the base curriculum. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. but none of the challenges involved with implementing the changes to the curriculum are a logical reason to be against the change itself. public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health and if such a transition is difficult, then it would be best to start making steps toward this change as soon as possible. this is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. if the base curriculum is about giving students the tools to make a positive and productive life in society, then an understanding of mental health and emotion is a necessity. for those asking or wondering how could someone possibly apply information about how mental health and emotion function? the answer is really quite simple: many people live life as if emotions are some sort of mysterious phenomenon that can t be understood, or as if it s so simple as one comment essentially put it: when you cry you get sad, there s nothing more to learn! that they forget how much of our perceptions and experiences are not actually based on what is truly happening externally, or what our genuine reaction to something is, but on physical surpluses and deficits of all sorts of signals in our brain. the culture of ignorance surrounding these topics leads people to live somewhat blindly in regard to how themselves and other people function, which is not ideal for a satisfied and productive society for obvious reasons. for those asking or wondering 'could you give some random examples of possible specific areas of study? ' sure. with no particular order or level of importance, because it would take a giant team of professionals to actually design this curriculum: chemical signals in the brain, electrical signals in the brain, the experiences that we have, how those experiences feel to us, how we react to them, how we perceive those reactions feelings experiences, how these elements function in society, how these elements relate to productivity, how these elements relate to our perception of 'well being' and 'satisfaction' in relation to what objective 'mental well being' could be in the sense of what is sustainable and scientifically healthy for a person's life in society , how these elements dictate our goals and decisions in society, how these desires, goals and decisions can fluctuate based on both external events and stimuli and personal chemistry and cycles in the brain, how external events and stimuli can influence the brain's chemical and electrical behavior, etc. a final note: sciences have to start somewhere. no one would imply that medicine just never should have been taught because some of the views taught in the past have been proven false or inadequate using the knowledge that we currently have and building from that is a natural part of the cycle of progression in different fields of science and this progression will continue to happen in the future. mental health is a massive scientific field and as such there will be a lot of evolution that will take place in the future, but we can't fast forward to then, and 'then' will never come unless we have a societal foundation to build off of, just like in any other scientific field. we should start teaching this subject and provide future generations a solid foundation to build off of like we've done with every other core subject in public schools' base curriculums. i should also note that saying 'math and english' was not specific. i was just bringing up two random subjects taught in base curriculums. interchange them with other core classes if you disagree with that example it's not really relevant to the opinion itself. also remember not to confuse the science of mental health with the field of psychiatry. psychiatry is only one small aspect of mental health.</td>\n",

College is simply another form of consumerism. : taken from a comment i made on another post and ed as i thought it s a pretty valid argument in my honest opinion, college is worthless and doesn t secure you anything in life. it s the biggest scam of the 21st century and you re better off getting your own education from the internet. using the internet is definitely a better alternative than paying off the debt from college for most of your adult life. there s a multitude of directions you could go in life that will be more successful than pursuing a degree. sure, there s jobs that require a degree, but jobs like that give you a pretty standard income that people that went to college only got with additional effort. that same additional effort could ve been given four years earlier had they not gone to college. the majority of people are scared of the risks they face without a degree. you are taught from a very young age that college is important and that information was passed down for generations without anyone asking why? those people who went to college without a second thought deep down only did it because they didn t want their parents to look at them funny. college just makes people feel more secure that they ll be successful in life because they feel scared and exposed without it. those people can t handle the reality of life just yet, and that s also why so many young people go to college; to delay having to go out into the real world. now, it isn t really their fault though, mind you, it s the fault of the education system. the united states want people to think in a way that makes them money, and if people think that college is absolutely necessary and that they ll flop without it, they make more money. for example, in school you get taught about stone tools from ten thousand years ago when you could be getting taught about modern politics instead, something that s actually useful. but, that wouldn t help the economy, so instead they numb everybody s minds on useless knowledge so that those people fall for their tricks and become consumers. and college is a prime example of consumerism. experience is the driving force for most people s success, and a simple google search can confirm that statement. people should spend their time getting that success for free with the internet as an alternative to wasting your time and money on college. sure, many billionaires went to college, but i assure you they would ve been billionaires anyways without their degrees. they were just feeling young and scared and they needed that extra little bit of security to get them going on the path to riches. they also didn t have access to the same vast amount of knowledge youth has today, the internet. in the 21st century, there s no more excuses for going to college.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Muslim women who wear a hijab for the sake of modesty shouldn't wear makeup. : it seems to be a pretty obvious contradiction to me that someone would cover their neck and hair out of modesty but then wear makeup which is supposed to make you stand out. some might say that they wear makeup for themselves not to get anybodys attention. honestly this doesnt make sense to me at all. i dont know how you can wear makeup for yourself. you dont get to see your face all day. other people do. its going to affect other people more than its gonna affect you. also those priorities seem kinda backwards. ive never wanted to have sex with a girl because i saw her neck and hair. but i certainly have after seeing their red lipstick. im not arguing that immodesty is necessarilly bad thats another debate. if you want to wear makeup thats fine. but i dont think you can do it while claiming modesty. i think girls who wear makeup while they while they wear a hijab, are simply virtue signalling.</td>\n",

situations : for the record, i am talking colloquially. technically i've is short for i have. however, my point is that the 'have' in i've is supposed to be used for the present perfect usage of i have. for example: i have been to the store. i have never been there. nothing makes me more irked when i see people saying something like 'i've my keys right now' or 'i've a low self esteem', and 'i've a tenuous grasp of the english language'. it is not supposed to be used with have as a verb. cmv i think i've adequately presented my point here but i'm only typing this because i need to fit

should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker : something that is often attributed to the success of the modern company and economic growth generally is the tying of ceo salaries to the stocks of their respective companies. this provides a powerful incentive to a ceo to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. the downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low skill workers, with ceos making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage. therefore, i think that as well as being tied to stock, ceo salary should also be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers   \n",

should be forbidden by law : crypto currencies such as bitcoin which rely on proof of work are bad for several reasons and should be forbidden by law. the environment crypto currency mining uses an ungodly amount of energy. by some estimates as much as denmark. quebec is suspending new power installations for crypo miners to ensure it has enough power for everyone else. as the world is facing catastrophic global climate change, this is an unacceptable use of power since it is totally unnecessary. alternatives such as proof of stake exist which would allow for almost no energy consumption what so ever. if the externalities of pow crypto mining were considered, it would never be profitable. in order to protect the environment, pow crypto should be forbidden. the gpu market pow crypto mining also significantly raises prices of gpus. let's remind ourselves, the work being done on these gpus is rubbish. it has no use, at all, to anyone other than being difficult. meanwhile it stifles both academic and medical research which uses gpus, as well as gamers and other common people who simply want the gpus to do calculations with actual uses. finally, even if pos crypto didn't exist, or despite whatever flaws pos might have, crypto would still be worth outlawing. simply put, it has no positive usefulness to anyone beyond speculation as a commodity and a means of transferring money in a clandestine manner. while its use as a means of transferring money privately could be marginally positive despite its use for funding crime, any benefit is far from outweighing the significant harms it poses to our world and happiness. change my view   \n",

There isn't scientific litterature proving that transwomen (who are biologically male) have a brain more similar to biological women's brain than men's (and vice-versa) : many people still argue ' why should i treat a man as a woman, they can't change reality ' and i don't think 'you should could respect their feelings' is a good argument, because even if someone feels 10 years old but is 30, we aren't expected to treat that someone as a 10yo no matter how offending it is to that person i'm searching the reason why gender should be different to me : if there's no reason to believe you're the opposite gender, there's no reason to treat you as the opposite gender the fact that transwomen have a brain more similar to biological women than men would be the perfect argument to justify that there is a real, legitimate an very good reason to treat transwomen as women but i can't find any scientific litterature, many people claim it but any article i see is just about 'some study' of which i can't find the source or just hints but not facts. gt ;before anyone makes this point : gt;i'm aware that gender sex, but that doesn't change my point : i could define 'genage' the the social construct around your biological age with many 'age roles' like being old is grumpy,being young is immature, etc gt ;then if i told someone 'genage is a social construct, i feel that my genage is 10yo' that someone still won't be socially expected to treat me as a 10yo. gt ;and if i actually had a 10yo brain and it's scientificaly proved, it would be an excellent reason to treat me as a 10yo gt;hence i'm asking that scientifical proof for transgender   \n",

all. so, with regards to abortion, i'm mostly pro life. my basic position is as follows: human life begins at fertilisation. as such, abortion is the killing of a human child. therefore, abortion is wrong in all cases other than the following: the mother's life is in grave danger if she continues with the pregnancy. the child has been pre diagnosed with a genetic problem which will cause them to die at birth or live an extremely short and horribly painful life before dying. in these cases, abortion can be considered the lesser of two evils. i think that basically sums up my position. i'd love to hear your views! have a great day.   \n",

     Males under 18 should be able to get a vasectomy and chemically castrated they wish. : roe v. wade said abortions could not be illegal because it restricted a woman's control of her body. however, males under 18 are not allowed to get vasectomy. this is clearly a double standard. if women under 18 can decide what to do with their body's why can't males. if an under 18 male knows that they will never have children they should have every right to get a vasectomy. any male should also be able to get chemically castrated at any age if they wish. this does not negatively impact society in anyway so it should have no restrictions.   \n",

               Super Mario Brothers 2 is not the best game : i know smb2 has won game of the year for the past 19 years, but i don t think it s that good. the gameplay is decent, the story is non existent, and it feels like the original but with a few new powers and enemies. it s no where near the best mario game nor the best game. i personally find hit games like minecraft, knack 2, and bookworm adventures deluxe being the 3 contenders for game of the year. i have gotten many times more hours of enjoyment out of these games than smb2 has ever been able to give me. these 3 games have each made my childhood and still affect me to this day. the second i started 1 1 in smb2 i felt sad knowing this couldn t live up to my expectations, immediately ruining my day. i regretted ever spending money on smb2 since it only made me worse feeling. minecraft, knack 2, and bookworm adventures deluxe are much better games than the game known as smb2. but hey, i m now willing to open my ears to everyone here reasons why this game is so good.   \n",
       "370    If public schools are truly focused on giving students a foundation for their futures, public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a major part of the base curriculum. : final post due to past technical glitches. this topic will only appear this final time. disclaimer: as it says at the end of the post, the use of math and english as examples is not specific. if you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . the opinion being presented here is just that room should be made in the base curriculum for the science of emotion and mental health. also, i m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. i m not talking about teaching kids a few basic social skills. we experience our entire existence through our minds, and the chemical and electrical signals going off in our brain largely dictate what experiences we have, how those experiences feel to us, and how we react to them. mental health and emotion is an enormous scientific field which can potentially encompass the entirety of that human experience, which leads to the simple question: how is such a massive field, one that influences so much of what human beings do, not being taught to some extent in our society as a core requirement? core subjects like science, math, and history are similarly large, and obviously can't ever be taught in full to students in a matter of only twelve years, which is why paid professionals spend so much time and money deciding what to teach, when to teach it, and how. none of that implementation, however, is necessary to establish before first accepting that schools should teach the subject as a major part of the base curriculum. i'm asserting that they should. a student gaining substantial knowledge on the science of emotion and mental health is far more likely to be important for their life after school ends than knowing how to find the base of a triangle or where to place the semicolon in a sentence. mental health affects literally everything in a person's life to a much greater extent than most things taught in public schools. productivity, stability, cooperation, families and relationships are all greatly dependent on having a healthy understanding of one's own perceptions and emotions and emotional reactions and an understanding of how perceptions, emotions and emotional reactions work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . i've mentioned this opinion to people in the past and many people try to argue mistakenly, in my opinion that teaching mental health and emotion should be the parents' responsibility. this makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on the subjects of mental health and emotion because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. if anything, based on that logic, it would make more sense to have the parents teach math and english and have the schools teach subjects of mental health. i don't agree with that logic, though. the only idea i'm officially presenting here is that public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a main part of the base curriculum. obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. but none of the challenges involved with implementing the changes to the curriculum are a logical reason to be against the change itself. public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health and if such a transition is difficult, then it would be best to start making steps toward this change as soon as possible. this is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. if the base curriculum is about giving students the tools to make a positive and productive life in society, then an understanding of mental health and emotion is a necessity. for those asking or wondering how could someone possibly apply information about how mental health and emotion function? the answer is really quite simple: many people live life as if emotions are some sort of mysterious phenomenon that can t be understood, or as if it s so simple as one comment essentially put it: when you cry you get sad, there s nothing more to learn! that they forget how much of our perceptions and experiences are not actually based on what is truly happening externally, or what our genuine reaction to something is, but on physical surpluses and deficits of all sorts of signals in our brain. the culture of ignorance surrounding these topics leads people to live somewhat blindly in regard to how themselves and other people function, which is not ideal for a satisfied and productive society for obvious reasons. for those asking or wondering 'could you give some random examples of possible specific areas of study? ' sure. with no particular order or level of importance, because it would take a giant team of professionals to actually design this curriculum: chemical signals in the brain, electrical signals in the brain, the experiences that we have, how those experiences feel to us, how we react to them, how we perceive those reactions feelings experiences, how these elements function in society, how these elements relate to productivity, how these elements relate to our perception of 'well being' and 'satisfaction' in relation to what objective 'mental well being' could be in the sense of what is sustainable and scientifically healthy for a person's life in society , how these elements dictate our goals and decisions in society, how these desires, goals and decisions can fluctuate based on both external events and stimuli and personal chemistry and cycles in the brain, how external events and stimuli can influence the brain's chemical and electrical behavior, etc. a final note: sciences have to start somewhere. no one would imply that medicine just never should have been taught because some of the views taught in the past have been proven false or inadequate using the knowledge that we currently have and building from that is a natural part of the cycle of progression in different fields of science and this progression will continue to happen in the future. mental health is a massive scientific field and as such there will be a lot of evolution that will take place in the future, but we can't fast forward to then, and 'then' will never come unless we have a societal foundation to build off of, just like in any other scientific field. we should start teaching this subject and provide future generations a solid foundation to build off of like we've done with every other core subject in public schools' base curriculums. i should also note that saying 'math and english' was not specific. i was just bringing up two random subjects taught in base curriculums. interchange them with other core classes if you disagree with that example it's not really relevant to the opinion itself. also remember not to confuse the science of mental health with the field of psychiatry. psychiatry is only one small aspect of mental health.   \n",

People’s time would be better spent building connections and using the internet to educate themselves on whatever career path they choose and think will make them successful in life. College is simply another form of consumerism. : taken from a comment i made on another post and ed as i thought it s a pretty valid argument in my honest opinion, college is worthless and doesn t secure you anything in life. it s the biggest scam of the 21st century and you re better off getting your own education from the internet. using the internet is definitely a better alternative than paying off the debt from college for most of your adult life. there s a multitude of directions you could go in life that will be more successful than pursuing a degree. sure, there s jobs that require a degree, but jobs like that give you a pretty standard income that people that went to college only got with additional effort. that same additional effort could ve been given four years earlier had they not gone to college. the majority of people are scared of the risks they face without a degree. you are taught from a very young age that college is important and that information was passed down for generations without anyone asking why? those people who went to college without a second thought deep down only did it because they didn t want their parents to look at them funny. college just makes people feel more secure that they ll be successful in life because they feel scared and exposed without it. those people can t handle the reality of life just yet, and that s also why so many young people go to college; to delay having to go out into the real world. now, it isn t really their fault though, mind you, it s the fault of the education system. the united states want people to think in a way that makes them money, and if people think that college is absolutely necessary and that they ll flop without it, they make more money. for example, in school you get taught about stone tools from ten thousand years ago when you could be getting taught about modern politics instead, something that s actually useful. but, that wouldn t help the economy, so instead they numb everybody s minds on useless knowledge so that those people fall for their tricks and become consumers. and college is a prime example of consumerism. experience is the driving force for most people s success, and a simple google search can confirm that statement. people should spend their time getting that success for free with the internet as an alternative to wasting your time and money on college. sure, many billionaires went to college, but i assure you they would ve been billionaires anyways without their degrees. they were just feeling young and scared and they needed that extra little bit of security to get them going on the path to riches. they also didn t have access to the same vast amount of knowledge youth has today, the internet. in the 21st century, there s no more excuses for going to college.   \n",

would cover their neck and hair out of modesty but then wear makeup which is supposed to make you stand out. some might say that they wear makeup for themselves not to get anybodys attention. honestly this doesnt make sense to me at all. i dont know how you can wear makeup for yourself. you dont get to see your face all day. other people do. its going to affect other people more than its gonna affect you. also those priorities seem kinda backwards. ive never wanted to have sex with a girl because i saw her neck and hair. but i certainly have after seeing their red lipstick. im not arguing that immodesty is necessarilly bad thats another debate. if you want to wear makeup thats fine. but i dont think you can do it while claiming modesty. i think girls who wear makeup while they while they wear a hijab, are simply virtue signalling.   \n",
