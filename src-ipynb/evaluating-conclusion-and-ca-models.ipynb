' generally, there are a few reasons: 1 the program that they promote does not work 2 the program that they promote is too hard to adhere to 3 the program that they promote is effective not too hard to adhere to, but the trainer has low personal ability to adhere 4 the trainer is inexperienced and a newcomer to fitness themself, in which case they are probably not a good fitness advisor of the above, number 3 would be the best case scenario, but it's still bad and would make many clients question the efficacy of the program and knowledge of the trainer i realize that body composition is largely a factor of what you eat, but most personal trainers include some advising on that as well even the fattest among us should be free to seek training certification i would just say that it is a red flag for a potential client if their personal trainer fat and out of shape without extenuating circumstances . to convince me otherwise, you'd have to show how a personal trainer being fat barring medical or similar reasons is not a poor reflection of their practices</td>\n",

'trickle down gender equality,' if you will. i think this is unconvincing for two reasons: first, because ime trickle down anything rarely seems to work, but second, and mainly, because while i could see how getting more female ceos or stem professionals is a great first step to getting even more female ceos or stem professionals aspiring women would have more female role models, like minded mentors mentors, see the fields as less hostile to women, etc. , i don't see how that could or would translate across professions. in short i don't see how getting more women in stem will automatically result in more female truckers, or how getting more female ceos will increase the female presence in mining. to cmv i'm basically looking for some reason why it's justified for those claiming to champion workplace equality to be so laser locked on three specific fields. if they claim to care about workplace equality and think it's not just a good thing for social justice reasons but also just makes good business sense, why are those the three fields that they focus on almost exclusively? or, of course, some other cmving explanation i haven't thought of. but that's why you're here. y'all know what to do. cheers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>If porn is \"bad\", then everything is : porn is bad! slap. bad! slap. young men unable to maintain erection because of porn! slap. death grip syndrome! slap. brain on porn is brain on drugs! slap. watching porn causes serious mental issues, prevents from building a healthy relationship with partner! slap. rapists, serial killers and domestic offenders have one thing in common, guess which one! slap. real men don't watch porn! slap. porn is bad! slap. if you ever tried googling about porn being possibly bad for you, you'd be slapped in your face by hundreds of pages claiming porn addiction as a serious disease and dangerous as much as any other, drugs, alcohol, tobacco or gambling. you might even get really disturbed by what you read and spend the sleepless night thinking how you are doomed for the rest of your life because you are either an addict or, worse, potential rapist and psychopath. it's fairly obvious who funds those kinds of articles, but anyway, let's pretend they are right. not 'excessive porn consumption might lead to numerous unhealthy consequences' , but pure 'porn is evil altogether' right. by that logic, reading books is really, really bad. it's scientifically proven people's sight becomes worse by focusing on lines of text regularly. even worse, it can cause an addiction so one stops caring about outside world, loses interest in studying or eating and starts dwelling inside fantasy world. are books bad? should we stop reading them whatsoever? eating fruits is really, really bad. it's scientifically proven fruits are loaded with sugar and, by consuming them, one can make his blood sugar levels skyrocket. furthermore, high sugar levels cause acne breakouts, breakouts cause depression. even worse, there are countless accounts of poisoning because of pesticides used in food industry myself included . are fruits bad? should we stop eating them whatsoever? love is really, really dangerous. it's scientifically proven that people in love have trouble focusing on work, tend not to pay attention to signs and don't sleep well. even worse, love can lead to serious complications, both physical and psychological, it can cause serious depression, despair, even suicide. is love bad? should we stop loving whatsoever? i guess it's enough now to make a point. anyway, what is so bad about a single guy or woman to treat their natural urges by watching porn and having fun with themselves? what is so bad about it happening on a daily basis even? what harm is done? young men have difficulties maintaining erection because of porn. no, young men have difficulties maintaining erection because they are just starting their sex lives, they are insecure and inexperienced and, in most cases, they don't always have a free room and unlimited time for proper sexy time with their girlfriends but have to rely on two hour opportunity when their parents aren't at home and presenting erection on demand doesn't always work. porn isn't real and expecting women to look like goddesses and behave like sex slaves can lead to many serious issues. good lord, of course porn isn't real! it's a fantasy! of course women are made to look like sex bombs with a single purpose to satisfy you! forbid anyone to watch harry potter because it's not real and expecting yourself to fly on a broom and cast spells with your magic wand can lead to many serious issues! porn offers unreal presentation of sex. of course it does, again, it's a fantasy. it's meant to look perfect. if porn was about real, uned sex, with guys having problems putting on condom and not being able to 'pound' endlessly and girls having dry and hurts problems and their parts making funny noises almost no one would watch it. porn is about visual pleasure, not physical. does it mean there are no men out there who struggle with erection and performance during intercourse because their arousal is tied to porn? of course not. but just because one kid discovers his murder tendencies by watching a teacher dissect a frog doesn't mean biology shouldn't be taught at schools because it's bad. porn is meant to be an addition, not a substitute for a sex life.</td>\n",

the world : the lgbtq crowd have spent the last few years on social media complaining they are ignored, now rita ora released a song somewhat related to them and she sings about how she likes to drink wine and kiss girls they complain about this and state she shouldn't be mentioning anything about their sexuality. so many think of lgbtq people are being constant drama queens, addicted to complaining for any small thing and just generally like to make people who are not saying they are lgbtq feel terrible how is this latest episode supposed to change that perception?   \n",

' generally, there are a few reasons: 1 the program that they promote does not work 2 the program that they promote is too hard to adhere to 3 the program that they promote is effective not too hard to adhere to, but the trainer has low personal ability to adhere 4 the trainer is inexperienced and a newcomer to fitness themself, in which case they are probably not a good fitness advisor of the above, number 3 would be the best case scenario, but it's still bad and would make many clients question the efficacy of the program and knowledge of the trainer i realize that body composition is largely a factor of what you eat, but most personal trainers include some advising on that as well even the fattest among us should be free to seek training certification i would just say that it is a red flag for a potential client if their personal trainer fat and out of shape without extenuating circumstances . to convince me otherwise, you'd have to show how a personal trainer being fat barring medical or similar reasons is not a poor reflection of their practices   \n",

homosexuality is/ should be classified as a mental disorder. : i recently posted on r nostupidquestions and got a lot of replies that didn't change my mind, but they suggested i try here. just to be clear i don't hate or judge homosexuals, i just believe it to be a mental disorder. in my mind, i believe that the biological purpose of all living things, humans included, is to survive and reproduce. i also believe that the primary purpose of sex sexual attraction is to reproduce. with that being said i acknowledge that homosexuality is not considered a choice, i wouldn't know because i am not a homosexual, but i agree with that premise. in final, i believe that if a human is born with the lack of attraction to a suitable mating partner, that it would have to be caused by some misdevelopment or chemical unbalance in the individual's brain. further more, i have learned that the definition of a mental disorder must include some form of harm to the individual suffering, and i believe homosexuality is no different. aside from lacking the means to reproduce mentally, not physically , i understand that homosexuals are at risk for higher suicide rates and are more susceptible to specific std i's. lastly i would like to reiterate that i mean no hate or insults, this is just my view on the situation. that being said i am happy to see if anyone can help change my view :

and acceptance that most diasporic Judaism supports is the result of historical marginalization, not fundamental differences from other Abrahamic religions. : i write this as a jew, a fairly observant one. i love that judaism, particularly diaspora judaism, supports acceptance and tolerance. however, i believe that these good qualities are the result of historic marginalization, not fundamental differences in doctrine compared to other abrahamic religions. while it is absolutely true that jewish religious texts support charity and kindness, so do the texts of christianity and islam. it can also be seen that in the instances where a jewish kingdom or majority society has been established, these principals of kindness are often ignored. this can be seen as far back as the hasmonean dynasty founded by the maccabees . the maccabees did not rebel to create religious freedom. they rebeled to impose judaism on those in the kingdom. you see similar trends in many states that are dominated by christians and muslims. that is to say, in nations with a heavy majority of any abrahamic religion, features of religious doctrines that call for charity and acceptance are often ignored. rather, i propose that the acceptance that much of mainstream diasporic judaism promotes is the result of historic marginalization and discrimination suffered until the mid twentieth century.   \n",

' or 'i wonder if she tells people that what she 'does' on twitch is sitting in front of camera looking pretty and talking to lonely guys who give her money. ' if you watch the video, she is a modestly dressed woman streaming in the appropriate section of twitch irl and is being ridiculed solely because she's pretty. whether or not you think her content is entertaining is one thing, but this is literally just putting her down because she's a girl. and that's what it boils down to: if you're a female streamer it seems to be a lose lose. you're either 'only popular because of your looks' or you'll get ridiculed by twitch users for being unattractive. hell, even pretty attractive females on twitch are still made fun of for their looks. tyler1's girlfriend macaiyla gets roasted all the time for having a big chin, and she's not even a streamer maybe she i ? i could be wrong while i do thing twitch is taking things a bit too far by playing favorites with some of the female streamers, i think the users have become even more sexist, because many are at a point where they equate attractive female to 'titty streamer' rather than looking at a female streamer in an objective wa . cm   \n",
       "1000   I find it somewhat suspicious that when feminists/progressives/liberals talk about gender parity/equality in the workplace seem to focus almost exclusively on STEM, politics, and CEO/high-level leadership positions. : just to define terms, 'gender parity equality in the workplace' here refers to having an equal amount of men and women in the workplace, or at least representation that reflects the gender demographics of the surrounding area. i understand that equality in the workplace is sometimes used to refer to, say, the issue of workplace harassment, and i take no issue with that, but it's not what i'm looking to address here. also just to clarify, this post isn't about the value of having more women in certain fields be it from a social justice point of view, a profit driven motive, or both and it isn't about the reasons why there might be more women in some fields and more men in others e. g. life work balance, women more interested in people men more interested in things, etc. . there's a lot of good discussion to be had over those two subjects, but i feel they'd be fairly off topic here. correct me if i'm wrong about that. right, so, pretty much every time i hear about the lack of gender equality in the workplace, the workplaces in question are almost invariably stem, politics, or ceo high level leadership positions which i'll shorten to just 'ceo' for the remainder of this post . when i specifically look for evidence that there's a push to get more women into other areas, like, say, construction, i can sometimes find evidence of it. but it seems far less prevalent and reported on discussed by less mainstream outlets companies than stem politics and ceo positions. and this makes me suspicious of the motives of people who claim to care about gender equality in the workplace while only focusing on these fields. as far as professions go, the three in question don't tend to employ large numbers of people. as far as gender disparities go the three fields in question aren't even the most egregious offenders: there's been much lamentation about how women only account for about a quarter of all stem positions, so surely there should be even greater outrage over the fact they only make up 1 of, say auto mechanics. well, where is it? where are all the forbes and cnbc and apa articles about the lack of female auto mechanics? where's the un initiative to get more women working on cars for a living? now to my main point straightens tin foil hat : call me crazy but i think those people who claim to care about gender equality in the workplace but focus primarily if not exclusively on stem, politics, and ceo positions have some ulterior motives. what those three fields all have in common is that they're some combination of high earning, high prestige, and high influence. if you want workplace equality in principle, it'd make sense to target pretty much any field with an imbalance, and arguably those fields that employ larger numbers of people with more egregious gender disparities than stem, politics, and ceos. there are much bigger fish out there in need of frying. and i think the reason these three smaller fish have been chosen has less to do with true gender equality and more with wanting to shoehorn women into positions that garner wealth, status, and or power. do you think, for example, that the reason feminists progressives liberals tend to focus on the lack of female ceos and not the lack of female electricians might, just might have something to do with the fact ceos average annual takehome is like 15x what electricians make? do you think the comparative repute and power that comes with working in politics might be the reason they've honed in on politics and not sewage treatment? in short, when feminists progressives liberals focus on the three fields in question beyond all others, the message they're sending out isn't that they care about workplace equality, it's that they want women to have the good jobs. the dangerous, physically demanding, thankless, low paying, low influence jobs? nahh. men can keep those. as a semi related aside i think it's also rather telling that people who claim to care about gender equality generally only seem to care about fields that are male dominated. there doesn't seem to be a lot of effort to, say, get more men into nursing, or even facets of stem that women dominate. one counterargument i've thought of might be that if we want to enact more gender equality at the 'top level,' so to speak, in order to enact change throughout the workforce as a whole. 'trickle down gender equality,' if you will. i think this is unconvincing for two reasons: first, because ime trickle down anything rarely seems to work, but second, and mainly, because while i could see how getting more female ceos or stem professionals is a great first step to getting even more female ceos or stem professionals aspiring women would have more female role models, like minded mentors mentors, see the fields as less hostile to women, etc. , i don't see how that could or would translate across professions. in short i don't see how getting more women in stem will automatically result in more female truckers, or how getting more female ceos will increase the female presence in mining. to cmv i'm basically looking for some reason why it's justified for those claiming to champion workplace equality to be so laser locked on three specific fields. if they claim to care about workplace equality and think it's not just a good thing for social justice reasons but also just makes good business sense, why are those the three fields that they focus on almost exclusively? or, of course, some other cmving explanation i haven't thought of. but that's why you're here. y'all know what to do. cheers.   \n",

                 Imperialism is completely inevitable, if not desirable. : tl;dr anti imperialism is an impossible ideology, not all nations are equal and thus not all nations deserve power, territory and resources, and imperialism is the only way for a country to grow, prosper and dominate effectively . now of course, i take a slightly more broader definition of 'imperialism', as i define it as basically synonymous with hegemony and one country controlling another country by force or through threat of force rather than simply the acquisition of territory . i've heard a lot recently about left leaning people and even right leaning people being fiercely anti war, anti imperial, anti interventionist, pro self deterimination and so on. my personal opinion is that imperialism is inevitable, if not desirable. for the first part, i'll explain why i think it is inevitable: i believe that a world without countries violently coercing each other is impossible, as different countries have different cultures, ideologies and ideas. countries are also inherently unequal, and some are more powerful than others. most countries also have a sense of self preservation. thus, you will always have one country violently coercing another and forcing it to adopt certain ideas in order to survive. the relationships between states are completely anarchistic, as there is no world government to enforce international rules. there are international agreements, but they aren't the same thing. there is also the simple fact that imperialism has had massive positive benefits that obviously can't be ignored, as coercing other countries to do what is good for your own country, yet bad for theirs, is still good for yours, regardless. even today, among supposedly 'anti imperialistic' countries such as the us, china, russia etc, they are imperialistic in every single way imaginable even communist china, ironically . they have to be, otherwise they themselves would become weaker and taken advantage of by another state that was imperialistic. there is no 'third option'. they must continue to puppet, coerce, sanction and expand in order to survive. as to why it is desirable: i personally don't believe in 'self determination', as it is an ideology that assumes that all nations deserve equal power, resources and territory, which i strongly disagree with. in order to preserve and expand the best cultures, ideologies and ideas, you have to get them to compete, and the ultimate competition is war. thus in this winner takes all world, the country with the most effective culture, ideology, government etc can conquer territory and resources so as to keep expanding that ideology and allow humanity to develop. treating all nations equally is a mistake and a waste of limited resources.   \n",

i would say no: although we ve become more secular, there is significant cultural pressure in favor of christianity. but, if you want to be a muslim or hindu, you are free to do so the majority culture at large doesn t and shouldn t infringe on this freedom. let s take gender and pronouns as another example here. the majority of us are heterosexual cisgender men and women. like with religion, our cultural norms reflect that. but, that isn t inherently a bad thing. now, i am totally in favor of passive solutions, such as gender neutral bathrooms, pronoun friendly designated spaces, and other options alongside male and female for gender information. these are great things acknowledging that not everyone fits our norms, and that s ok. but i think in everyday interactions, abolishing all gender pronoun assumptions is extreme. for context, i m in the military, and we address each other as sir ma am based on appearance. this is a rule, but we also respect each other. i m sure if anyone had an issue with these titles, they could speak up and we d accommodate them. i don t see why this approach shouldn t work for society at large: create a respectful environment, but solve on a case by case basis. thus, there s no need to dismantle societal norms to deal with a few rare cases. nearly all the time, a person s gender identity matches their appearance. this is empirically true. if there s ambiguity, sure, don t assume. if you make a mistake, apologize and move on. case by case. simple as a name correction. someone else s identity is none of your business. but a few exceptions don t justify changing well established rules. to be clear, i m not advocating to do nothing. i m advocating for education, tolerance, and respect for all people. reasonable assumptions that are incorrect are misunderstandings, not disrespect. aside from the practicality of assumptions, some people want their gender assumed. philosophically, that s just as valid, and we can t have it both ways. i take issue with the idea that we must make drastic changes to our social norms for the benefit of a few people. not only is this unnecessary to achieve our goals and illogical, but it is also impractical: pressure from the majority will always exist, and isn t a problem as long as we uphold our obligations of tolerance. we didn t need to adopt marxism to establish worker protections or welfare. i think the belief that adopting radical ideas is necessary is, at best, overzealous, and at worst, completely misguided. cmv! i talked specifically about gender, but this applies to other social issues as well.   \n",

is needed. if the word pan is used just be more exclusive, well that seems a bit ridiculous as i ve also researched that the definition of bisexual can also mean same and other genders which would make it nearly identify to pan. and just creating a whole new sexuality for trans or for other genders seems redundant, and like a way to showcase how open minded you are. same for the idea than pan means that the focus is on the person and not the gender. seems like a way to show off how inclusive you are, that you re more progressive. it irks me because in comparison, bisexuals can be seen as less open than pan. they both mean you can be attracted to the same or other genders. it s redundant to create a whole new sexuality, which i think is just used to be progressive.   \n",

should we stop reading them whatsoever? eating fruits is really, really bad. it's scientifically proven fruits are loaded with sugar and, by consuming them, one can make his blood sugar levels skyrocket. furthermore, high sugar levels cause acne breakouts, breakouts cause depression. even worse, there are countless accounts of poisoning because of pesticides used in food industry myself included . are fruits bad? should we stop eating them whatsoever? love is really, really dangerous. it's scientifically proven that people in love have trouble focusing on work, tend not to pay attention to signs and don't sleep well. even worse, love can lead to serious complications, both physical and psychological, it can cause serious depression, despair, even suicide. is love bad? should we stop loving whatsoever? i guess it's enough now to make a point. anyway, what is so bad about a single guy or woman to treat their natural urges by watching porn and having fun with themselves? what is so bad about it happening on a daily basis even? what harm is done? young men have difficulties maintaining erection because of porn. no, young men have difficulties maintaining erection because they are just starting their sex lives, they are insecure and inexperienced and, in most cases, they don't always have a free room and unlimited time for proper sexy time with their girlfriends but have to rely on two hour opportunity when their parents aren't at home and presenting erection on demand doesn't always work. porn isn't real and expecting women to look like goddesses and behave like sex slaves can lead to many serious issues. good lord, of course porn isn't real! it's a fantasy! of course women are made to look like sex bombs with a single purpose to satisfy you! forbid anyone to watch harry potter because it's not real and expecting yourself to fly on a broom and cast spells with your magic wand can lead to many serious issues! porn offers unreal presentation of sex. of course it does, again, it's a fantasy. it's meant to look perfect. if porn was about real, uned sex, with guys having problems putting on condom and not being able to 'pound' endlessly and girls having dry and hurts problems and their parts making funny noises almost no one would watch it. porn is about visual pleasure, not physical. does it mean there are no men out there who struggle with erection and performance during intercourse because their arousal is tied to porn? of course not. but just because one kid discovers his murder tendencies by watching a teacher dissect a frog doesn't mean biology shouldn't be taught at schools because it's bad. porn is meant to be an addition, not a substitute for a sex life.   \n",

       "1000  i think you're missing the point. i think the main point of feminism is to focus on the issues that are most important to women. i'm not sure if you're aware of the issue of gender equality in the workplace, but i think it's important to note that the issue is not about gender equality. it's about the issue that women are more likely to be in the workforce than men. the issue isn't that women aren't in the job, but that men are more often in the position of leadership. the problem is that women don't have the same opportunities as men. women are often more likely than men to be involved in the work of men. this is a problem that is not unique to feminism. it is a symptom of the problem that women have in the field of engineering. it isn't about the lack of women in the industry, but rather the lack in the number of women who are in the profession. the problems with this are that women tend   \n",
