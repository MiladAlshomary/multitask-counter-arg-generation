' even the anti environmentalist crowd of super conservative survivalists might be able to get behind the survival branding, rather that the 'going green' branding. amp; x200b; i have reached out to many people about this and received no feedback. so this makes me wonder if this is not as big of a deal as i think it is. can someone change my view, that 'green' is a perfectly good primary word to use to brand the cause of environmentalism?   \n",

       "0  models of climate change predict, in the very near future, existential threats to humanity. in particular are weather effects that will drastically reduce food supplies and access to potable water. in the western hemisphere, it is obvious that this will be far more disastrous to those south of the us border where, even right now, access to food and water is a real issue for millions of people. while the proposed border wall may not be entirely justifiable in its ability to stop current illegal immigration and illicit transport of contraband, in the event of a massive migration, greater in scale by magnitudes than that seen in europe, a border wall will be absolutely necessary to stop the influx. now, one might argue that it is morally unjustifiable to turn away the starving masses, which is a nice sentiment. however, this sentiment fails at practicality: this country s own food supply will also be taxed and to let in millions will only ensure that even more people will starve together as opposed to some living and some dying. if one were to argue that we caused more pollution than they did, and so should not live whilst they die, then the rational answer is to go ahead and commit suicide now so that you will not contribute more pollution or reduce any more resources that you feel others have more right to possess. doing otherwise is only to make the moral judgement for others by removing their agency. would a person who claims that we don t deserve to live instead of these potential refugees feel justified to murder infants now? if not, then how could they argue that an arbitrary amount of time will serve to justify that same death for wrongs committed at the same time that the same person was an infant? or before they were even born since the worst of the pollution caused by the us was done between 40 to 70 years ago ? it is not justifiable because neither the infant nor the potential refugee had a part in the damage done. so, what is left to argue? in the event of a refugee crisis, will a wall stop more refugees than no wall? obviously it will. is the cost of constructing one now less than it will be in the future? yes, it is, and it would have been cheaper still had it been built 5, 10, or 20 years ago. the worst case scenario of building the wall now is that it would be totally ineffective at the stated purpose and it would cost the government money that would otherwise be earmarked off to some other pork barrel project. that is very little risk when considered against the future benefit that can be provided.   \n",
