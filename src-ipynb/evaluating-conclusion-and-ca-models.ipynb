       "      <td>Classism is America's biggest problem. Not Racism. : tl;dr classism is the root cause of socioeconomic inequality in the united states, not racism. racism is simply the mechanism by which classism enables and justifies itself. i have become somewhat uncomfortable around most of my liberal friends i'm also liberal since developing this view, because they're not very open to other perspectives. so i would like for someone to show me the light, show me why i'm wrong. in the past couple decades, a great deal of the discourse on inequities and social injustices in the u. s. has centered predominantly around one word: racism. racism has a few operational definitions depending on who you talk to , but perhaps the most widely accepted understanding of racism is that it is the ongoing enactment of or complicity with the systemic and institutionalized oppression of marginalized populations. a sociologist named joe feagin defined 'institutionalized racism' as this: gt; systemic racism includes the complex array of antiblack practices, the unjustly gained political economic power of whites, the continuing economic and other resource inequalities along racial lines, and the white racist ideologies and attitudes created to maintain and rationalize white privilege and power. systemic here means that the core racist realities are manifested in each of society s major parts each major part of u. s. society the economy, politics, education, religion, the family reflects the fundamental reality of systemic racism. while i have a couple issues with this definition i. e. it seems to entirely ignore other extremely disadvantaged groups, such as the hispanic and native american populations , i feel that this is an adequate and concise summary of a very complex concept. but i think that we're wasting our breath. now, before anyone accuses me of being a denier of racism, let me say this: i believe wholeheartedly that racism, systemic or otherwise, is alive and 'well' in the united states. however, racism is not the foundational, fundamental source of racial inequality in the u. s that is to say, in attempting to alleviate socioeconomic inequities through the stamping out of racism, we are gravely missing the mark. i believe that with each passing day in which we attribute racial and socioeconomic inequalities to racism above all else, we lose an opportunity to truly address and 'treat' the disease underlying: classism. to continue analogizing these concepts to healthcare, attempting to ameliorate the racial inequalities of the u. s. by rooting out racism will be equally effective as a psychologist attempting to treat the auditory hallucinations of his her schizophrenic patient by suggesting that the patient wear earplugs. this is not to say that racism is not deeply intertwined with classism, either. our human brains are incredible at pattern recognition. it is one of our most powerful tools as a species! we look for differences and similarities between objects, people, and concepts. moreover, we form incredibly complex associations between these things and develop schemas by which we can more easily understand new information. however, this incredibly valuable gift has its flaws: we are also affected by confirmation bias, and we do not always correctly identify patterns or attribute patterns to the correct causes. these are all significant factors in birthing racial as well as cultural, gendered, religious, etc. prejudices and profiles. let's talk statistics for a moment, yeah? a couple things: 1 according to the 2017 united states census approximately 35 or, approx. 1 3rd of black americans and hispanic american are living under, at, or 'near' poverty meaning that their earnings are equal to 150 of the federal poverty line or less . keep in mind that the u. s. census is not able to include the homeless population in their data. 2 a recent data analysis of incarceration rates by race ethnicity showed that black americans are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white americans, proportionally. 3 lastly, another data analysis of preincarceration incomes showed that the median annual income of the incarcerated population prior to their incarceration is approximately 19,000 when controlled for race . hmm. interesting. so, to summarize these conclusions: 1 a higher proportion of those in poverty are incarcerated or at the very least a higher proportion of those incarcerated were in poverty 2 a higher proportion of black americans are in poverty. 3 a higher proportion of black americans are incarcerated. poverty correlates with incidence of mental health disorders and or substance abuse disorders, with likelihood of experiencing trauma, with lack of education, with less stable family structures, etc. you can look all these studies up for yourselves, there's a lot of them. we fear being poor, don't we? not just having trouble making ends meet, but, rather, finding ourselves in destitution among the destitute. we also disdain those who are poor, but mostly we fear them. how many muggers or gang members or murderers wear business attire or have clean cut appearances? some, perhaps, but that's not what we are shown. we are taught from birth to associate poverty, regardless of skin color, with danger, untrustworthiness, crime, and immorality. my view is that racism is simply the mechanism by which classism enables and justifies itself. my view and i invite any person to change it is that classism , not racism, is the 'foundational, fundamental source of racial inequality.

       "      <td>\"Offensive\" language in the gaming community is not the exception, it's the rule. : the gaming community is riddled with the use of language that non gamers consider 'offensive. ' i come from the generation of gamers that first saw modern online gaming; cs: source, wow, ps2 network games, cod, stuff from well over a decade ago. online gaming has always been about competition and the winner usually berating those they beat in some fashion. at first it started with 'owned' and 'noob': 'you just got owned, noob! ' then, it progressed to more explicit exclamations: 'suck my d k, fa ot! ' now, and going back about 3 4 years, it seems the commonplace terms are 'raped' and 'ni er. ' you've seen pewdiepie get in hot water for using the latter, and in most online games you're in, whether it be 10 people or dozens, someone's calling someone a derogatory slur or threatening to rape someone. when these instances occur, the gaming community usually decries the perpetrator saying they are just a bad egg and don't represent the gaming online community as a whole. i think this is a blatant and egregious straight up lie. while there are certainly respectful and great people in the gaming community, the majority are ill tempered, abrasive, and socially stunted individuals that have a deficiency when it comes to interpersonal communication and tact. when stories come out about popular gamers using such language, it is a glimpse into the vast underbelly of the community, not an outlier of that community. to flesh out my view, i consider myself a free speech proponent, but i do think the providers of online gaming services the publishers and developers of the games, not isps should be regulating and fostering the types of environments they want their games to have. whether or not you think it should be okay for people to say whatever they want in a game, whether it be directed at other players or npcs non player characters , i don't think it can be hidden anymore that the aggressive language and derogatory slurs are the language of gamers and commonplace within the community. now, this could be a result of the particular games i tend to play shooters, mobas, usually ultra competative types which may attract a certain type of person. this may be one avenue to changing my view. while these games are not the only games out there, they are certainly the ones that get the most mainstream attention due to the pro gaming leagues that are now formed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Most people who vote Democrat and are generally in favor of higher taxes and similar costs imposed on members of our society, especially those who are wealthier, do so because they themselves have never had to pay such high taxes (and likely never will). : full disclosure, my father is a general practitioner in a rural location. he makes roughly 250,000 a year before taxes. i am also currently an accountant at a tax firm that deals with a large number of farmers, land owners, and rental property owners, many of whom are pulling down income numbers in the six digits. gross income often sounds impressive at first glance, but most people forget about the reality that is taxes, which, because income taxes in america are progressive, become much greater as you begin to work your way up the tax bracket. i ve watched my dad pay what i considered, especially as a broke college student, to be relatively egregious taxes year after year. for example, according to the software that we use at our firm, if you re earning 250k in south dakota, you can expect to pay 63,064 in taxes. that s literally more than many people in america make in a year. my dad worked for years to become a doctor. he didn t start making what most would consider a doctor s salary' until the age of 30. he has a family of 4 and himself to provide for. and yet he s paying over 60k in taxes. it s actually even worse, because this still doesn t take into account the additional amount of taxes he pays as a land owner and a homeowner, which are easily an additional 8k a year. setting aside property taxes, even just the federal taxes on a hypothetical income of 250k would put his effective rate of taxation at 25. 22 . imagine going to work, whatever job it is, and knowing that for every dollar you make, the government is taking away from you 25 cents. if this was true for people making minimum wage, there would be an uproar, but for some reason just because an individual earns more, oftentimes at the personal expense of years of hard work, we accept that this rate of taxation is acceptable. i understand that there are many individuals who are born into wealth. my father would never be wealthy even if he didn t have a family to support and saved every single dollar he earned for the rest of his life. the truly wealthy are not millionaires. i understand that many people think it s unfair that other select people essentially have everything handed to them at the beginning of their life and that their life will always and forever be taken care of so long as the money doesn t run out for whatever reason. but putting aside the 1 , why are we taxing the upper middle class at the rates we do? i agree that the truly wealthy can afford these rates. bill gates would not bat an eye. but for people with family obligations and who want to be able to put all their children through college, particularly if those colleges are top tier and therefore oftentimes more expensive ignoring scholarships , earning six figures is not all that it s cracked up to be. it s certainly better than earning 30k or less per year, but it s not like my dad and people like him are living lavish lifestyles and spending extravagantly. my dad hasn t taken a vacation in years because his work doesn t really allow him to since he is one of only three doctors in a rural area with a large circumference of responsibility. if we as a society truly want to ensure that the current legion of the rich remain the same family name forever and always, there is, in my opinion, no better way to do this than to tax the hell out of the upper middle class. why even bother with working as much as many of these individuals do when you know that you re going to be making an average of 75 cents on the dollar or worse? even worse is that because the taxes are progressive, the disincentive to earn more increases the farther you go. eventually you make it to the point where you re making just over 50 cents on the dollar at the marginal rate . and at that point, you are essentially working pro bono for the government. yes, yes, i know. roads. subsidized utilities. etc, etc. also, steven mnuchin taking a private jet for his personal use on the taxpayers dime. also the bailout of banks who were bailed out due to their gambling losses. i have very little faith in the idea that government has the ability to use taxpayers money in an efficient manner as they have shown time and time again. would privatization of everything be better? maybe, maybe not. but you can almost certainly bet that resource allocation would be more efficient, because if it isn t, then these private companies stand to lose market share to their competitors. the point of my argument is that i believe that the majority of people who vote democrat do so because they themselves tend not to be upper income individuals who are subject to the kinds of tax rates that more affluent people are, and if they had an opportunity to watch 60k of money they earned vanish in a flash of a tax return right before their eyes, money that is equivalent to hundreds of hours worked a year, they might have a change of heart regarding what is and isn t fair in the realm of taxation and who should be taxed at what rate. i tend to see myself as a reasonable person when it comes to good alternative arguments. come at me. well it looks as though the auto downvoters are now in full swing. if there's one thing that i feel our country has lost since the last election, it's our ability to give compelling argument instead of resorting to emotional auto responses. but no, this is simply the reality of things as they are now. don't worry, this thread will be off the hot page of this sub before you know it. 2: i actually feel much less pessimistic after having read some of the replies and apologize for the prior . if there's anything i've taken away so far, it's that we shouldn't presume the worst in people and their intentions and instead try to look for the bright spots despite the dimness that can seem fully encapsulating at times. despite what some people here may think, i actually really value discussion and the possibility for a reversal of my previous outlook. keep the comments coming. i'd honestly like to hear from all of you. 3: we are cruising at an altitude of 0 upvotes for this post. death is imminent. it was fun while it lasted amp; i appreciate everyone's time. goodnight!</td>\n",

       "      <td>To reduce abortions in the US, it would be more effective to provide universal healthcare rather than to create anti-abortion laws. : there are many people in the us that want to prevent abortion. i've heard some people even say the main reason they wanted justice kavanaugh on the scotus is to change abortion laws. i too agree that having less abortions would be better. but i don't think anti abortion laws would be as effective as some people think. first of all, before you try to reduce abortion rates the first thing you should do is look at the reasons people get abortions. this website gives a general overview for some reasons: a main factor for abortions throughout the various times, and among the various states is socio economic. to me this makes a lot of sense. on average us hospital deliveries cost 3500. meanwhile only 39 of americans have enough savings to cover a 1,000 emergency. so if i was a woman living in the us faced with this sort of economic problem. i'd be incentivized to find some way to get an abortion. and this isn't even factoring in the cost of raising a child. anti abortion laws would just promote desperate people to find more unsafe options for having an abortion since it would not change their motivation for having an abortion. universal healthcare, however, would take a step in changing a woman's motivation for having an abortion by alleviating a major cost of having a child. obviously there would still be other factors to consider in reducing abortion rates. but still, for those against abortion, the target should be in changing women's motivations for an abortion rather than in changing laws to prevent abortion.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Arguing that historically oppressed people such as blacks cannot be racist only fuels further animosity towards the social justice movement, regardless of intentions. : hi there! i've been a lurker for a bit and this is a my first post here, so happy to receive feedback as well on how able i am on expressing my views. anyway, many if not most people in the social justice movement have the viewpoint that the historically oppressed such as blacks cannot be racist. this stems from their definition of racism where they believe it requires systemic power of others to be racist. this in itself is not a problem, as they argue that these oppressed people can be prejudiced based on skin color as well. they just don't use the word 'racist'. the problem, however, lies in the fact that literally everyone else outside this group has learned defined racism as something along the lines of 'prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. ' google whatever their source is , merriam webster, and oxford all have similar definitions which don't include the power aspect that these people define as racism. thus, there is a fundamental difference between how a normal person defines racism and how a social justice warrior defines racism, even though in most cases, they mean and are arguing the same exact point. when these people claim in shorthand things like 'black people can't be racist! ' there is fundamental misunderstanding between what the writer is saying and what the reader is interpreting. this misinterpretation is usually only solvable through extended discussion but at that point the damage is already done. everyone thinks these people are lunatics who want to permanently play the victim card and absolve themselves from any current or future wrongdoing. this viewpoint is exacerbated with the holier than thou patronizing attitude tone that many of these people take or convey. twitter examples: hayes status 778803492043448321 i took these examples from a similar cmv post that argues that blacks can be racist the idea that people of colour cannot be this type of preaching of 'blacks can't be racist! ' completely alienates people who may have been on the fence regarding the movement, gives further credibility ammunition to the opposition, and gives power to people that actually do take advantage of victimizing themselves, while the actual victims are discred all because of some stupid semantic difference on how people define racism. ultimately, the movement should drop this line of thinking because the consequences far outweigh whatever benefits it brings. in fact, what actual benefit is there to go against the popular definition and defining racism as prejudice power? i genuinely cannot think of one. it just seems like an arbitrary change. i now understand that the use of the definition academically and regarding policies is helpful since they pertain to systems as a whole.</td>\n",

                                                  marijuana should be legal for recreational use : so i am a strong believer in using marijuana for recreational use. i live in australia where it's illegal and look to places like colorado and holland. some of my quick points: it's a lot less addictive than cigarettes or alcohol it's a lot less dangerous than cigarettes or alcohol it's a relatively safe substance when legalised and put through checks like you would any other legal substance it causes a lot of crime, something that stops with the legalisation it is a gateway drug and legalising it would greatly decrease use of dangerous drugs it is an anti depressant and greatly helps many mental health problems feel free to agree, disagree, and add stuff to any of these points above, and please. cmv!   \n",

Not Racism. : tl;dr classism is the root cause of socioeconomic inequality in the united states, not racism. racism is simply the mechanism by which classism enables and justifies itself. i have become somewhat uncomfortable around most of my liberal friends i'm also liberal since developing this view, because they're not very open to other perspectives. so i would like for someone to show me the light, show me why i'm wrong. in the past couple decades, a great deal of the discourse on inequities and social injustices in the u. s. has centered predominantly around one word: racism. racism has a few operational definitions depending on who you talk to , but perhaps the most widely accepted understanding of racism is that it is the ongoing enactment of or complicity with the systemic and institutionalized oppression of marginalized populations. a sociologist named joe feagin defined 'institutionalized racism' as this: gt; systemic racism includes the complex array of antiblack practices, the unjustly gained political economic power of whites, the continuing economic and other resource inequalities along racial lines, and the white racist ideologies and attitudes created to maintain and rationalize white privilege and power. systemic here means that the core racist realities are manifested in each of society s major parts each major part of u. s. society the economy, politics, education, religion, the family reflects the fundamental reality of systemic racism. while i have a couple issues with this definition i. e. it seems to entirely ignore other extremely disadvantaged groups, such as the hispanic and native american populations , i feel that this is an adequate and concise summary of a very complex concept. but i think that we're wasting our breath. now, before anyone accuses me of being a denier of racism, let me say this: i believe wholeheartedly that racism, systemic or otherwise, is alive and 'well' in the united states. however, racism is not the foundational, fundamental source of racial inequality in the u. s that is to say, in attempting to alleviate socioeconomic inequities through the stamping out of racism, we are gravely missing the mark. i believe that with each passing day in which we attribute racial and socioeconomic inequalities to racism above all else, we lose an opportunity to truly address and 'treat' the disease underlying: classism. to continue analogizing these concepts to healthcare, attempting to ameliorate the racial inequalities of the u. s. by rooting out racism will be equally effective as a psychologist attempting to treat the auditory hallucinations of his her schizophrenic patient by suggesting that the patient wear earplugs. this is not to say that racism is not deeply intertwined with classism, either. our human brains are incredible at pattern recognition. it is one of our most powerful tools as a species! we look for differences and similarities between objects, people, and concepts. moreover, we form incredibly complex associations between these things and develop schemas by which we can more easily understand new information. however, this incredibly valuable gift has its flaws: we are also affected by confirmation bias, and we do not always correctly identify patterns or attribute patterns to the correct causes. these are all significant factors in birthing racial as well as cultural, gendered, religious, etc. prejudices and profiles. let's talk statistics for a moment, yeah? a couple things: 1 according to the 2017 united states census approximately 35 or, approx. 1 3rd of black americans and hispanic american are living under, at, or 'near' poverty meaning that their earnings are equal to 150 of the federal poverty line or less . keep in mind that the u. s. census is not able to include the homeless population in their data. 2 a recent data analysis of incarceration rates by race ethnicity showed that black americans are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white americans, proportionally. 3 lastly, another data analysis of preincarceration incomes showed that the median annual income of the incarcerated population prior to their incarceration is approximately 19,000 when controlled for race . hmm. interesting. so, to summarize these conclusions: 1 a higher proportion of those in poverty are incarcerated or at the very least a higher proportion of those incarcerated were in poverty 2 a higher proportion of black americans are in poverty. 3 a higher proportion of black americans are incarcerated. poverty correlates with incidence of mental health disorders and or substance abuse disorders, with likelihood of experiencing trauma, with lack of education, with less stable family structures, etc. you can look all these studies up for yourselves, there's a lot of them. we fear being poor, don't we? not just having trouble making ends meet, but, rather, finding ourselves in destitution among the destitute. we also disdain those who are poor, but mostly we fear them. how many muggers or gang members or murderers wear business attire or have clean cut appearances? some, perhaps, but that's not what we are shown. we are taught from birth to associate poverty, regardless of skin color, with danger, untrustworthiness, crime, and immorality. my view is that racism is simply the mechanism by which classism enables and justifies itself. my view and i invite any person to change it is that classism , not racism, is the 'foundational, fundamental source of racial inequality.

' i come from the generation of gamers that first saw modern online gaming; cs: source, wow, ps2 network games, cod, stuff from well over a decade ago. online gaming has always been about competition and the winner usually berating those they beat in some fashion. at first it started with 'owned' and 'noob': 'you just got owned, noob! ' then, it progressed to more explicit exclamations: 'suck my d k, fa ot! ' now, and going back about 3 4 years, it seems the commonplace terms are 'raped' and 'ni er. ' you've seen pewdiepie get in hot water for using the latter, and in most online games you're in, whether it be 10 people or dozens, someone's calling someone a derogatory slur or threatening to rape someone. when these instances occur, the gaming community usually decries the perpetrator saying they are just a bad egg and don't represent the gaming online community as a whole. i think this is a blatant and egregious straight up lie. while there are certainly respectful and great people in the gaming community, the majority are ill tempered, abrasive, and socially stunted individuals that have a deficiency when it comes to interpersonal communication and tact. when stories come out about popular gamers using such language, it is a glimpse into the vast underbelly of the community, not an outlier of that community. to flesh out my view, i consider myself a free speech proponent, but i do think the providers of online gaming services the publishers and developers of the games, not isps should be regulating and fostering the types of environments they want their games to have. whether or not you think it should be okay for people to say whatever they want in a game, whether it be directed at other players or npcs non player characters , i don't think it can be hidden anymore that the aggressive language and derogatory slurs are the language of gamers and commonplace within the community. now, this could be a result of the particular games i tend to play shooters, mobas, usually ultra competative types which may attract a certain type of person. this may be one avenue to changing my view. while these games are not the only games out there, they are certainly the ones that get the most mainstream attention due to the pro gaming leagues that are now formed.   \n",

There should be more support programs for men to go into college and affirmative action shouldn't include gender : according to stats women are the the indisputable majority of the collegue students and graduates in general. in many colleges women's ratio can even reach 60 75 . there are already hundred if thousands times more support programs for women to go into college than men. i rarely seen major non profit orgs on education do anything for men. current education system heavily encourages females students to go into colleges while do nothing for men. there is no 'you go girl! ' mentality for the boys in young ages. currently the primary beneficior of the affirmative action is 'white women' and they are also the majority of the college student and graduates. don't you think it's kinda ridiculous? i understand that back in times women needs that support programs and affirmative action when men didn't. but now they are already the majority and they are much more succesfull. why should they still need affirmative action of millions of support programs. shouldn't these orgs and colleges try to help men to go into college since they are the minority that needs help? or at least don't favour women on affirmative action. if anyone needs affirmative action, that's men not women. if colleges and this orgs care so much about diversity why the male student numbers continuesly drops every year? or diversity means 'less men especially if they are white! ' sorry for my terrible. it's not my native. i'm not american either but i'm really interested in american politics. where i live there is also way more support programs for females but we have no affirmative action. everybody who wants to go college go into an sat like exam and colleges only considers that score when they accept students. no gender, no race, no culture etc can be considered. it's almost an automated process. sometimes you can get scholarships if you good at sports, music etc but yeah nobody cares about your gender or ethnicity   \n",
       "579    Most people who vote Democrat and are generally in favor of higher taxes and similar costs imposed on members of our society, especially those who are wealthier, do so because they themselves have never had to pay such high taxes (and likely never will). : full disclosure, my father is a general practitioner in a rural location. he makes roughly 250,000 a year before taxes. i am also currently an accountant at a tax firm that deals with a large number of farmers, land owners, and rental property owners, many of whom are pulling down income numbers in the six digits. gross income often sounds impressive at first glance, but most people forget about the reality that is taxes, which, because income taxes in america are progressive, become much greater as you begin to work your way up the tax bracket. i ve watched my dad pay what i considered, especially as a broke college student, to be relatively egregious taxes year after year. for example, according to the software that we use at our firm, if you re earning 250k in south dakota, you can expect to pay 63,064 in taxes. that s literally more than many people in america make in a year. my dad worked for years to become a doctor. he didn t start making what most would consider a doctor s salary' until the age of 30. he has a family of 4 and himself to provide for. and yet he s paying over 60k in taxes. it s actually even worse, because this still doesn t take into account the additional amount of taxes he pays as a land owner and a homeowner, which are easily an additional 8k a year. setting aside property taxes, even just the federal taxes on a hypothetical income of 250k would put his effective rate of taxation at 25. 22 . imagine going to work, whatever job it is, and knowing that for every dollar you make, the government is taking away from you 25 cents. if this was true for people making minimum wage, there would be an uproar, but for some reason just because an individual earns more, oftentimes at the personal expense of years of hard work, we accept that this rate of taxation is acceptable. i understand that there are many individuals who are born into wealth. my father would never be wealthy even if he didn t have a family to support and saved every single dollar he earned for the rest of his life. the truly wealthy are not millionaires. i understand that many people think it s unfair that other select people essentially have everything handed to them at the beginning of their life and that their life will always and forever be taken care of so long as the money doesn t run out for whatever reason. but putting aside the 1 , why are we taxing the upper middle class at the rates we do? i agree that the truly wealthy can afford these rates. bill gates would not bat an eye. but for people with family obligations and who want to be able to put all their children through college, particularly if those colleges are top tier and therefore oftentimes more expensive ignoring scholarships , earning six figures is not all that it s cracked up to be. it s certainly better than earning 30k or less per year, but it s not like my dad and people like him are living lavish lifestyles and spending extravagantly. my dad hasn t taken a vacation in years because his work doesn t really allow him to since he is one of only three doctors in a rural area with a large circumference of responsibility. if we as a society truly want to ensure that the current legion of the rich remain the same family name forever and always, there is, in my opinion, no better way to do this than to tax the hell out of the upper middle class. why even bother with working as much as many of these individuals do when you know that you re going to be making an average of 75 cents on the dollar or worse? even worse is that because the taxes are progressive, the disincentive to earn more increases the farther you go. eventually you make it to the point where you re making just over 50 cents on the dollar at the marginal rate . and at that point, you are essentially working pro bono for the government. yes, yes, i know. roads. subsidized utilities. etc, etc. also, steven mnuchin taking a private jet for his personal use on the taxpayers dime. also the bailout of banks who were bailed out due to their gambling losses. i have very little faith in the idea that government has the ability to use taxpayers money in an efficient manner as they have shown time and time again. would privatization of everything be better? maybe, maybe not. but you can almost certainly bet that resource allocation would be more efficient, because if it isn t, then these private companies stand to lose market share to their competitors. the point of my argument is that i believe that the majority of people who vote democrat do so because they themselves tend not to be upper income individuals who are subject to the kinds of tax rates that more affluent people are, and if they had an opportunity to watch 60k of money they earned vanish in a flash of a tax return right before their eyes, money that is equivalent to hundreds of hours worked a year, they might have a change of heart regarding what is and isn t fair in the realm of taxation and who should be taxed at what rate. i tend to see myself as a reasonable person when it comes to good alternative arguments. come at me. well it looks as though the auto downvoters are now in full swing. if there's one thing that i feel our country has lost since the last election, it's our ability to give compelling argument instead of resorting to emotional auto responses. but no, this is simply the reality of things as they are now. don't worry, this thread will be off the hot page of this sub before you know it. 2: i actually feel much less pessimistic after having read some of the replies and apologize for the prior . if there's anything i've taken away so far, it's that we shouldn't presume the worst in people and their intentions and instead try to look for the bright spots despite the dimness that can seem fully encapsulating at times. despite what some people here may think, i actually really value discussion and the possibility for a reversal of my previous outlook. keep the comments coming. i'd honestly like to hear from all of you. 3: we are cruising at an altitude of 0 upvotes for this post. death is imminent. it was fun while it lasted amp; i appreciate everyone's time. goodnight!   \n",

child. this form of slavery is socially accepted encouraged even , legal, and virtually never recognized. parents are forced to take care of their own children and are paid nothing in return. think about it imagine if you were forced to take care of some other person in this way. imagine that you were forced to feed, care for, transport, and provide other services to some other person without being paid. if you fail to carry out these duties , then you will be charged with a crime and thrown in jail. would you not say that you were then enslaved to this individual? essentially, the child is the slave owner, the parent is the slave, and the government is the slave driver. i feel that this has some implications but for this cmv i d like to mostly just focus on whether or not parenthood is indeed slavery.   \n",

effective to provide universal healthcare rather than to create anti-abortion laws. : there are many people in the us that want to prevent abortion. i've heard some people even say the main reason they wanted justice kavanaugh on the scotus is to change abortion laws. i too agree that having less abortions would be better. but i don't think anti abortion laws would be as effective as some people think. first of all, before you try to reduce abortion rates the first thing you should do is look at the reasons people get abortions. this website gives a general overview for some reasons: a main factor for abortions throughout the various times, and among the various states is socio economic. to me this makes a lot of sense. on average us hospital deliveries cost 3500. meanwhile only 39 of americans have enough savings to cover a 1,000 emergency. so if i was a woman living in the us faced with this sort of economic problem. i'd be incentivized to find some way to get an abortion. and this isn't even factoring in the cost of raising a child. anti abortion laws would just promote desperate people to find more unsafe options for having an abortion since it would not change their motivation for having an abortion. universal healthcare, however, would take a step in changing a woman's motivation for having an abortion by alleviating a major cost of having a child. obviously there would still be other factors to consider in reducing abortion rates. but still, for those against abortion, the target should be in changing women's motivations for an abortion rather than in changing laws to prevent abortion.   \n",

' google whatever their source is , merriam webster, and oxford all have similar definitions which don't include the power aspect that these people define as racism. thus, there is a fundamental difference between how a normal person defines racism and how a social justice warrior defines racism, even though in most cases, they mean and are arguing the same exact point. when these people claim in shorthand things like 'black people can't be racist! ' there is fundamental misunderstanding between what the writer is saying and what the reader is interpreting. this misinterpretation is usually only solvable through extended discussion but at that point the damage is already done. everyone thinks these people are lunatics who want to permanently play the victim card and absolve themselves from any current or future wrongdoing. this viewpoint is exacerbated with the holier than thou patronizing attitude tone that many of these people take or convey. twitter examples: hayes status 778803492043448321 i took these examples from a similar cmv post that argues that blacks can be racist the idea that people of colour cannot be this type of preaching of 'blacks can't be racist! ' completely alienates people who may have been on the fence regarding the movement, gives further credibility ammunition to the opposition, and gives power to people that actually do take advantage of victimizing themselves, while the actual victims are discred all because of some stupid semantic difference on how people define racism. ultimately, the movement should drop this line of thinking because the consequences far outweigh whatever benefits it brings. in fact, what actual benefit is there to go against the popular definition and defining racism as prejudice power? i genuinely cannot think of one. it just seems like an arbitrary change. i now understand that the use of the definition academically and regarding policies is helpful since they pertain to systems as a whole.   \n",
