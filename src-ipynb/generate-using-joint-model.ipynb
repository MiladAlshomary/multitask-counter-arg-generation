       "301385  [the second amendment to the constitution is the most cited defense of gun ownership in the usa., the claim is that gun ownership is allowed, largely unrestricted, because the constitution assures all law abiding citizens this right., ccw holders, specifically, are claimed to have the one of the lowest crime rates in american society, a question that i have had recently is this: what if the constitution was changed to carve out more restricted access to guns?, would the class of 'law abiding' ccw holders and gun owners comply with the new laws?, or would they see this change as unconstitutional and disobey the new law?, this act, of course, would render them no longer 'law abiding. ', i believe that no, most previously law abiding gun owners would not give up their weapons, despite now being criminals., if the argument is that gun owners are the most law abiding citizens, it follows that they should obey the new law., this is regardless of the morality, effectiveness, or popularity of the law law abiders follow all laws as closely as possible., many law abiding gun owners claim to respect the constitution, however, i honestly believe that if the second amendment were changed that most previously law abiding gun owners would not respect the new law., this does not make sense if the claim is that gun owners respect the constitution, since once an amendment is in the constitution it quite literally becomes constitutional., this would mean that law abiding gun owners do not actually care about following the law or holding up the constitution., what they actually care about is access to guns, and possibly upholding certain family or regional traditions., therefore gun owners do not actually respect the constitution, they just agree with the constitution because it justifies their beliefs in gun ownership., so can you change my view reddit?, my view is that 'law abiding' gun owners do not believe in the rule of law to the extent that they claim., if the constitution were changed to place more restrictions on access to firearms, most previously law abiding gun owners would rather become criminals than follow the new laws., therefore gun ownership has nothing to do with respect for the constitution or law and only has to do with the preservation of american gun culture.]   \n",
