       "404067  [i want to preface this that i like the idea behind automatic voter registration., it helps encourage the political process., but specifically, in my home state of florida, under the current system this would not be a good idea, for one main reason., in florida, the voter roll is public information., anyone can request a disk containing the entire voter roll including names, addresses, birthdays, mailing addresses, gender, race, etc. for free., there are several sites that offer searchable databases of this data., even if you could get your data off these sites some sites refuse to take stuff down , you also would have to file an exemption request, the only options available to a common citizen are: victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery, or domestic violence., official verification of the crime is required certified participant in address confidentiality program only for victims of domestic violence you cannot simply request an exemption just because you want to be anonymous, or because you are afraid of a person who hasn't committed a specific provable crime against you., with automatic voter registration, we'd be putting a large amount of personal information in a public database, most likely without the knowledge of those being registered., this is a massive breach of privacy and can be a danger to society., as this is automatic, this database will begin to look more and more like a database of the names and addresses of the majority of floridians., a white supremacist could use the database to target ethnic minorities, as race is included in the database a person could use the information in the database to possibly commit identity theft a person could be stalked using the information in the database a victim of a crime, such as rape, that they did not report or that could not be prosecuted, could be found by their abuser a person of general popularity, such as an internet celebrity, could be doxxed quite simply, florida needs the way it handles i's citizens' personal data before implementing automatic voter registration.]   \n",

       "359706  i'm not sure why you're being capable of taking an argument of good, but it seems like that's just not the case, but i don't think the actual solution is more important, which is to make sure that there's no problem with it. what i'm asking is why there's a difference between an fact or a reasoning. i do think there is a moral difference between a evidence and an argument for a human being to do anything but be 'procdating' which is simply not that important to me. this seems like a good idea in general, but not to me as an example. you don't need to be 'free' as a 'a 'better' part of a god. 'in a case of a human.'is that not the fact that everyone is'ssa' that has made it worth you to be sure.'yes, you'd say that the future will be more 'femen' because other people do,  "
