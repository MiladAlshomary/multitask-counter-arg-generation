       "      <td>[one of the historical methods of repressing out of favor religions is to make them pay exorbitant taxes., the blanket religious tax exemption is one of the ways we comply with the first amendment., many atheists seem to forget it guarantees the free exercise of religion in addition to forbidding the establishment of a state religion., taxing them like everyone else doesn't make sense because everyone else pays widely varying tax rates., should they be taxed as a commercial entity or an industrial one?, which subtype?, some religious practices involve wine., does that mean the churches will need permits taxes fees licenses as a resturant?, some christian sects consider the use of wine critical to the ceremony, others consider grape juice to be fine because it is symbolism., the rules and regulations answering those questions will burden some religions sects more than others., this then becomes a ripe area for both intentional and unintentional discrimination against out of favor religious groups., this will be hugely problematic for the free exercise clause., it is just as problematic for the establishment clause., as per the current justification for emminent domain, increased tax revenue is a justifying public good., taxing churches like everyone else would allow a state or locality to use eminent domain foreclosures in order to build a new mega church., the baptists catholics whoever will pay greater taxes than the mosque temple out of favor group currently on that corner., back to the wine example, the sect that doesn't use wine now has a significant financial advantage over the one that does., if the existence of a cross shaped veterans memorial is an establishment of religion, then surely providing tax advantages is.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[from someone who's grown up in the christian church:churches receive their income primarily through 'tithes,' which is a voluntary donation of sorts that each congregation member is expected to give yes, i know, 'voluntary' and 'expected to give. ', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]  \n",
       "3  [i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]  \n",

', people get bored of each other., they learn things about each other they don't like., they meet someone new and exciting and better than their partner that they'd like to explore a relationship with., they should be free to move on when they're not into it anymore without the stigma of divorce., i am 100 for monogamy., relationships should remain exclusive unless both parties explicitly agree otherwise., cheating is never okay., change my view., i hope i didn't offend anyone; i don't mean to insult anyone by insinuating that they're foolish for getting married., i just think that society has unrealistic expectations of the human attention span when it comes to relationships., also, it's early in the morning and i haven't slept., i've proofread twice, but i'm on a new phone and i'm still getting used to the keyboard., thanks ahead of time for your responses., thanks to u electrostaticrain and everyone else who made the argument that many of the things i thought were a requirement of marriage, are not actually required by law .]</td>\n",

', the problem is that no one can fully comprehend marriage and still believe that they and their partner can succeed at it., it's an impossible promise to fulfill., it is impossible to know someone so well that you know for a fact that they will never betray you, ever., the marriages that end due to natural death of old age and have never been violated by either party are few and far between., if we could extend the human life expectancy another 50 years i don't doubt they would have ended in divorce., i understand that marriage isn't supposed to be perfect or easy., it's supposed to be difficult., you're supposed to work together through the rough times., however if a person or their so consciously violate the marriage, or even if you just eventually get tired of being married, then what is the point in being married at all?, and i think given enough time, every marriage will have at least one party who after all is said and done would move on if they could., i think it would be much better to say, 'i care about you and trust you so much that i am literally willing to do anything i can fathom you asking of me and anything within reason to protect you and our relationship, as long as i still feel like it. ', people get bored of each other., they learn things about each other they don't like., they meet someone new and exciting and better than their partner that they'd like to explore a relationship with., they should be free to move on when they're not into it anymore without the stigma of divorce., i am 100 for monogamy., relationships should remain exclusive unless both parties explicitly agree otherwise., cheating is never okay., change my view., i hope i didn't offend anyone; i don't mean to insult anyone by insinuating that they're foolish for getting married., i just think that society has unrealistic expectations of the human attention span when it comes to relationships., also, it's early in the morning and i haven't slept., i've proofread twice, but i'm on a new phone and i'm still getting used to the keyboard., thanks ahead of time for your responses., thanks to u electrostaticrain and everyone else who made the argument that many of the things i thought were a requirement of marriage, are not actually required by law .]   \n",

       "      <td>i agree that the study is not fair, but the reasons are different from the ones you've given: homosexual couples adopting children achieve far better results in any of these studies because they face far more obstacles before adoption. they need to put in more effort, an effort you might not make if you aren't absolutely sure you want to have a child. homosexual parents are hand picked and therefor feature far less bad apples. comparing that group to heterosexuals having their own children is extremely unfair if you consider that about half of pregnancies are accidental. you're comparing a group of which almost everyone is 100 committed to their cause with a group where 50 didn't even choose that cause. even by comparing them to heterosexual couples that have also adopted, stability is still an issue. just as with marriage, homosexual couples are statistically more committed to take these steps when they take them. they're made aware of far more issues that affect both relationships equally than heterosexual couples, meaning they're likely to have put far more prior thought into said issues. i know quite a few married gay couples of which all are in no danger of separating, something i cannot say for the heterosexual couples i know. why? because all of the homosexual couples turned a stable relationship into a stable marriage, while quite a few of the heterosexual couples just shouldn't have gotten married at all. this will probably change in the future, when more and more of the affected people have grown up knowing they will be allowed to adopt and marry freely, no matter what sexual orientation.</td>\n",

'punching is wrong' . arguing that two wrongs don't make a right supports that initial assumption. a punching b is bad because punching is wrong, so in order to say that b is not wrong in hitting a, you have to modify the initial assumption. you would then have to argue that punching is not inherently wrong and is only made so by certain circumstances. put more simply, if action a is intrinsically wrong, no amount of repetition will strip that inherent wrongness. if something wrong is made not wrong by another wrong, it is not intrinsically wrong.   \n",

       "925  i agree that the study is not fair, but the reasons are different from the ones you've given: homosexual couples adopting children achieve far better results in any of these studies because they face far more obstacles before adoption. they need to put in more effort, an effort you might not make if you aren't absolutely sure you want to have a child. homosexual parents are hand picked and therefor feature far less bad apples. comparing that group to heterosexuals having their own children is extremely unfair if you consider that about half of pregnancies are accidental. you're comparing a group of which almost everyone is 100 committed to their cause with a group where 50 didn't even choose that cause. even by comparing them to heterosexual couples that have also adopted, stability is still an issue. just as with marriage, homosexual couples are statistically more committed to take these steps when they take them. they're made aware of far more issues that affect both relationships equally than heterosexual couples, meaning they're likely to have put far more prior thought into said issues. i know quite a few married gay couples of which all are in no danger of separating, something i cannot say for the heterosexual couples i know. why? because all of the homosexual couples turned a stable relationship into a stable marriage, while quite a few of the heterosexual couples just shouldn't have gotten married at all. this will probably change in the future, when more and more of the affected people have grown up knowing they will be allowed to adopt and marry freely, no matter what sexual orientation.   \n",
