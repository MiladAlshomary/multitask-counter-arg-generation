       "50  [i say 'almost always' because you never know when a lebron type athletic qb will come along., my only caveat is a bona fide freak of nature., i've yet to see such a player., my reasons: 1., the nfl is a pass first league., without an elite passer, teams cannot compete for super bowls., aside from a few anomalies, this is a hard and fast rule., the role of the qb is to get the ball to the open man downfield., a completed pass, on average, nets more yardage than a run, therefore a completed pass is more valuable than a run., teams that put a high value on a qb's ability to run the ball are over valuing this skill., 2., qb's that have the ability to run learn from a young age to bail on pass plays too early whenever they feel the rush closing in., they have likely been the best and fastest athletes on the field during their entire amateur careers, so running has likely led to big plays., in the nfl, the defenses are bigger and faster and can close on a qb much more quickly than high school or college defenders., 3., qb's with elite running ability take more risks during a game., by holding the ball or leaving the pocket, they are opening themselves up to big hits resulting in fumbles and devastating injuries., injured qb's have no value to their team., chronically injured qb's drafted as a franchise qb not only have no value, but they can leave a team wallowing in mediocrity for years decades., injuries must be avoided at all costs., 4., most running qb's have to be 'broken' of their penchant for scrambling in lieu of keeping their eyes downfield., this causes their development to be stunted in comparison to qb's whose sole focus has been honing their elite passing skills only., in a league where the continued employment of coaches and gm's is contingent upon winning right now, a delay in the development of a qb can cost seasons and jobs and thus continuity ., franchises with frequent management turnover are not competitive., 5., tom brady, peyton manning, drew brees all have basically zero running skills whatsoever yet all three are the best of their generation and super bowl champs., the following is an aside and not meant to be part of my view that needs changing., in conclusion and just to add a little more controversy to my ramblings , it is my position that cam newton, rg 3, and colin kaepernick will never win a super bowl., if we look ahead to the 2014 nfl draft, my belief is that the biggest gamble and potential franchise killer amongst the available qb's is johnny manziel., if my analysis holds true, any team that uses a high first round pick on manziel to be their franchise qb is likely betting their future on a player that has an extremely small probability to lead them to a super bowl win., change my view.]   \n",

       "38  the system you are describing is not capitalism. under capitalism, do you get directly rewarded for your hard work? no, most of the hardest workers get paid piecemeal wages, and live in terrible conditions. it's never going to be profitable to meet everyones needs. welfare states are built off the exploitation of foreign workers, you can't have a global system that would adquetely satisfy need. there are viable alternatives. socialism, where industry is worker owned, is viable, and has existed. you can still have market socialism where there is still a profit motive, but it's not capitalism, so it is a 'viable alternative' while fitting your idea of what you think is viable. many other forms of socialism, while being non market, reward people for their contribution, directly for their hard work. so, your ideal system is actually socialism, which is an alternative to capitalism.   \n",
