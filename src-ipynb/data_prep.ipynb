       "      <td>[one of the historical methods of repressing out of favor religions is to make them pay exorbitant taxes., the blanket religious tax exemption is one of the ways we comply with the first amendment., many atheists seem to forget it guarantees the free exercise of religion in addition to forbidding the establishment of a state religion., taxing them like everyone else doesn't make sense because everyone else pays widely varying tax rates., should they be taxed as a commercial entity or an industrial one?, which subtype?, some religious practices involve wine., does that mean the churches will need permits taxes fees licenses as a resturant?, some christian sects consider the use of wine critical to the ceremony, others consider grape juice to be fine because it is symbolism., the rules and regulations answering those questions will burden some religions sects more than others., this then becomes a ripe area for both intentional and unintentional discrimination against out of favor religious groups., this will be hugely problematic for the free exercise clause., it is just as problematic for the establishment clause., as per the current justification for emminent domain, increased tax revenue is a justifying public good., taxing churches like everyone else would allow a state or locality to use eminent domain foreclosures in order to build a new mega church., the baptists catholics whoever will pay greater taxes than the mosque temple out of favor group currently on that corner., back to the wine example, the sect that doesn't use wine now has a significant financial advantage over the one that does., if the existence of a cross shaped veterans memorial is an establishment of religion, then surely providing tax advantages is.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[from someone who's grown up in the christian church:churches receive their income primarily through 'tithes,' which is a voluntary donation of sorts that each congregation member is expected to give yes, i know, 'voluntary' and 'expected to give. ', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]</td>\n",

', it's confusing for churchgoers, too ., the tithe is at a 10 standard., this is the means through which the church has to pay for property values, utilities, staffing, etc., churches have operated based on a realistic tithe income based on current income and membership growth., there are some churches that are very well off and probably wouldn't suffer too much from taxing., other churches barely struggle to pay their bills and staff because of tithing issues or other extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or whatever., let's say we implement a flat tax at 5 of the church's revenue., the church is expected to operate at 95 revenue while still maintaining 100 output., the church could, in response, raise the expected tithe to compensate for that cut., the congregation would respond by saying that that isn't the biblical expectation for the congregation., which it isn't., and since the tithing is optional, revenue would either stay the same or go down., the natural reaction is that people just wouldn't tithe., it could actually go further in reality., what i expect if the church were to be taxed would be that secret churches would start to meet like the ones that happen where christianity is illegal., the government can't really track that stuff too well though i wouldn't put it past them anymore ., so scratch that, we could do a tax rate that increases based on the church's revenue., then we would get the problem that plagues the united states taxes churches would just split up into smaller units and record their income at the lowest rate; likely one where the church isn't taxed at all., so there's how that revenue works and the probable results., hope this helps!]  \n",
       "3  [i've served on my local church's council and i understand the perception of the church having a lot of money., that being said, while the church i attend brings in a lot of money a little less than 500k year 100 of it goes into supporting the church as a whole staff wages, operational expenses, building mortgage, etc and the church mission local community outreach programs such as food banks and soup kitchens, national outreach through monetary donations, etc ., lets look at the simple budget for my church next year: 500,000 that's a good chunk of change., 91 of that money is donated without the expectation of receiving any tangible thing., the remaining 9 is mainly collected from rental fees by individuals and organizations that want to use the church for their activities., now on how the money is spent nearly 50 of the budget is spent on staff salaries, benefits and payroll., seeing as i live in a state where the cost of living is quite high, we try very hard to pay our pastor, youth minister and administrative assistant competitive wages while we aren't 100 with getting a comparable wage we do try., 10 of the budget is spent on benevolence straight up donating 10 of our income to the greater church., remaining 40 operations and community outreach, and future set asides., the church has regular expenses just like any other entity., we have a mortgage to pay, electrical bills, insurance, advertising, pastoral training, running a twice weekly soup kitchen, twice a sunday services, etc., now lets add an 'income tax' onto this while thing., as you can see most every penny that goes into the church, goes right back out to the community at large., the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 ., so let's knock 175,000 right out of the budget., so instead of 500k, we have 325,000 basically enough to cover competitive pastoral wages, benefits, and have 75,000 left over for everything else., it boils down to local community benefit., the federal government isn't concerned with making sure people are hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the downtrodden consoled., churches and religious communities are some of the only organizations that have the ability to directly influence the lives of people in their community., taxing religious organizations is a bad idea because of the community outreach that a lot of these organizations provide., i'm not saying there aren't bad apples, but i'd say 95 of churches provide a bigger community benefit by direct outreach, instead of letting the government come in and take finances out of your community.]  \n",

       "      <td>[in my opinion, socialism is superior to capitalism in many regards: 1., democratic control of the means of production is necessary in a fair and free society., in a capitalist system, the ruling class decides what is produced, and they usually do so because they're only human to benefit themselves and not the people as a whole., additionally, in capitalism, being rich is advantageous and will give you more say in what is produced., therefore, not only do a handful of people have the power to make selfish decisions at the cost of the people, they are encouraged to do so., in a socialist system, this problem would be solved by giving everyone an equal say in what is produced., people would still make decisions in their own self interest, of course, but since everybody has the same amount of say, nobody would be able to make decisions at the expense of others., in addition, because everyone would be able to vote in their own self interests and be fairly represented, there would be no reason for ills like poverty to exist., 2., more innovation would occur under socialism., despite capitalist claims to the contrary, it is my view that in a socialist system more innovation occur., why?, because if one individual or corporation has a monopoly, or large amounts of influence in an economic sphere, it is his or her self interest to prevent competition in that sphere, because people buying from a different company hurts sales., therefore it is advantageous to stomp our new ideas., in socialism, this would not occur because everyone would have an equal amount of control of the economy, and there would be no reason for anyone to have the desire to prevent innovation., those are my main, and best, reasons i have for supporting socialism., if i think of any more, i will the text and add them., i look forward to a healthy and challenging discussion.]</td>\n",
       "      <td>Socialism is superior to capitalism.</td>\n",
       "      <td>[re 1 ., democratic control of the means of production yields two basic problems: efficiency because the process is democratic majority rules then the normal distribution of skill in a society produces bias towards the averagely or even the poorly skilled which hampers both the best use of resources and towards inability to fully comprehend the issue more uneducated people than educated ones see how democratic choices are made in today's society, far from perfect., practical management it might work in small groups of people but just as running a 100m country is more complex than a 10m or 1m country so is running a 1bn country., if you take a look at how insanely convoluted, amoral, corrupt and removed from the common man while also inefficient, wasteful, obstinate all the democratic structures of power are in any large country you should be able to imagine how those structures would work when producing something within 24 hours is necessary., notice that democratic structures take a long time to work while production and trade often need to be managed quickly., there is another issue that has to do with the fact that in capitalist society you are paid for your work whether you are happy with it is another matter while in socialist society not necessarily., therefore if you happen to be the minority view in socialism and the means of production are utilized agianst your wishes you are losing more than under capitalism., there is huge potential for socialism to distort the decisionmaking process in large companies and i mean starting around 100 people which is not a lot and not only the corporations so much that more people end up losing out under socialism than under capitalism., re 2 : innovation is really something that occurs as a process of evolution of information neither socialism nor capitalism which are the systems of ownership have have much influence since information cannot be owned ., therefore any attempt to take it over whether for private gain capitalism or the society's gain through democratic government control socialism is essentially at odds with the nature of free flow of information., there are issues as to how research and study can be funded but that is entirely derivative of the fundamental cause: can we force others to behave with regards to information as we want them to ., in other words if you can force people to do your bidding then you can both own information and introduce slavery both deeply unnatural states., the only way for innovation to occur is as it did with science through 'info anarchy' so to speak., and it would also be the progress that would be most beneficial to society as it would remove all barriers to participation., socialism has proven time and time again to be a failure in society., every socialist system has either collapsed under its own inefficiency anarchist spain being so inefficient that the bolsheviks took over, makhnoist ukraine being simply conquered and unable to resist or slowly descends into a totalitarian authoritarian elitist police state where the people in power increase their oppression of society to hide economic inefficiencies., the failure of socialism lies in its unrealistic premises as to how the goals would be implemented not necessarily in the general ideas it upholds and the social and economic aims it wants to achieve., your main problem stems from the fact that as most socialists you seem to misunderstand the difference between how economic exchange with people and political force people action in society works i did use the terms arbitrarily leadership and influence is under 'economic' here since it provides a gain to followers ., you assume that political action solves issues while economic action creates them when in reality it is exactly the opposite because economic action has to take into consideration what the other side wants while political action only takes into consideration at which point the other side will resist., therefore most pathological situations on the market happen when government is brought to bear on one side of the deal or the other whether to aid corporations, labour unions, rich, poor,military, church, industrialists,landowners, peasants, workers that's where most of the distortion occurs and as long as we gloss over it and pretend like it's something natural which it is in a biological sense it's animalistic and animals kill each other just as we do then no constructive solution to any economic problem in society is possible., therefore the real axis of conflict isn't private or communal ownership of means of production capitalism socialism but coercive and voluntary participation state anarchy ., there are some things which work better under socialism and some under capitalism and to achieve maximum gains we might need both at the same time but in different areas but the one thing that we never can mix is forcing people to obey in one area and letting them be free in another., it will always end up being authoritarian everywhere., power being an unsustainable entropy like phenomenon abhors vacuum and always expands until it expends all resources available or collapses under its own weight.]</td>\n",

', argument falls apart., because i don't think unkindness is a thing that should be tolerated., asking someone to not walk up to someone and insult their outfit is a lot different than thinking the person that does that is a jerk., i think political correctness is important in the same way i think manners are important., i think we all need to at least put a decent effort forth into not actively trying to hurt people's feelings because we think it makes us look cool and edgy and i think if we do hurt someone's feelings, we shouldn't try to make it into a thing where we act as though they are oppressing us for saying we shouldn't do that., so far i haven't really changed my view, although i find a lot of this interesting., i think what i'm starting to think is that if we thought of being pc as simply being considerate and kind to people, it might be a better place to work from than where we're working from now.]   \n",

       "139261  [re 1 ., democratic control of the means of production yields two basic problems: efficiency because the process is democratic majority rules then the normal distribution of skill in a society produces bias towards the averagely or even the poorly skilled which hampers both the best use of resources and towards inability to fully comprehend the issue more uneducated people than educated ones see how democratic choices are made in today's society, far from perfect., practical management it might work in small groups of people but just as running a 100m country is more complex than a 10m or 1m country so is running a 1bn country., if you take a look at how insanely convoluted, amoral, corrupt and removed from the common man while also inefficient, wasteful, obstinate all the democratic structures of power are in any large country you should be able to imagine how those structures would work when producing something within 24 hours is necessary., notice that democratic structures take a long time to work while production and trade often need to be managed quickly., there is another issue that has to do with the fact that in capitalist society you are paid for your work whether you are happy with it is another matter while in socialist society not necessarily., therefore if you happen to be the minority view in socialism and the means of production are utilized agianst your wishes you are losing more than under capitalism., there is huge potential for socialism to distort the decisionmaking process in large companies and i mean starting around 100 people which is not a lot and not only the corporations so much that more people end up losing out under socialism than under capitalism., re 2 : innovation is really something that occurs as a process of evolution of information neither socialism nor capitalism which are the systems of ownership have have much influence since information cannot be owned ., therefore any attempt to take it over whether for private gain capitalism or the society's gain through democratic government control socialism is essentially at odds with the nature of free flow of information., there are issues as to how research and study can be funded but that is entirely derivative of the fundamental cause: can we force others to behave with regards to information as we want them to ., in other words if you can force people to do your bidding then you can both own information and introduce slavery both deeply unnatural states., the only way for innovation to occur is as it did with science through 'info anarchy' so to speak., and it would also be the progress that would be most beneficial to society as it would remove all barriers to participation., socialism has proven time and time again to be a failure in society., every socialist system has either collapsed under its own inefficiency anarchist spain being so inefficient that the bolsheviks took over, makhnoist ukraine being simply conquered and unable to resist or slowly descends into a totalitarian authoritarian elitist police state where the people in power increase their oppression of society to hide economic inefficiencies., the failure of socialism lies in its unrealistic premises as to how the goals would be implemented not necessarily in the general ideas it upholds and the social and economic aims it wants to achieve., your main problem stems from the fact that as most socialists you seem to misunderstand the difference between how economic exchange with people and political force people action in society works i did use the terms arbitrarily leadership and influence is under 'economic' here since it provides a gain to followers ., you assume that political action solves issues while economic action creates them when in reality it is exactly the opposite because economic action has to take into consideration what the other side wants while political action only takes into consideration at which point the other side will resist., therefore most pathological situations on the market happen when government is brought to bear on one side of the deal or the other whether to aid corporations, labour unions, rich, poor,military, church, industrialists,landowners, peasants, workers that's where most of the distortion occurs and as long as we gloss over it and pretend like it's something natural which it is in a biological sense it's animalistic and animals kill each other just as we do then no constructive solution to any economic problem in society is possible., therefore the real axis of conflict isn't private or communal ownership of means of production capitalism socialism but coercive and voluntary participation state anarchy ., there are some things which work better under socialism and some under capitalism and to achieve maximum gains we might need both at the same time but in different areas but the one thing that we never can mix is forcing people to obey in one area and letting them be free in another., it will always end up being authoritarian everywhere., power being an unsustainable entropy like phenomenon abhors vacuum and always expands until it expends all resources available or collapses under its own weight.]  \n",

about the free rider problem., it presents itself in many ways and is always frustrating., those paying into the system want to see those that are not coerced into participating., your solution to the organ shortage would probably work, but it goes beyond coercive and is actually punitive., that may be what you want, but medical decisions shouldn't be based on punishment, otherwise felons should never get organ donations, regardless of their willingness to donate., and there is a much easier and softer method of coercion we haven't tried in the united states: opt out registration., right now, you have to opt in to being an organ donor., switch it so everyone is presumed to be an organ donor unless they opt out., most people don't care about organ donation unless it effects them in some way., and most people won't go out of their way to do something if they don't care about it., that cuts both ways., just like most people aren't going out of their way to register as organ donors, most won't go out of their way to de register., the pool of available organs would shoot way up., i'd much rather try that soft coercion than outright punishing people for not being altruistic.]

[no one gets off their asses for 'the future is equal', and while you stand to incite more critics with 'the future is female', you also incite more passionate people to your cause by making a statement that pushes the current status quo., the former statement doesn't have any clear call to action nor challenge against the established way of thinking because the established way of thinking is that we are already equal., the latter statement carries with it a call to action, a suggestion that in a world where historical inequalities still lie ingrained in our various systems, we may have to over correct these systems by emphasizing the needs of women specifically., we may have to put women's issues at the forefront of our minds and actions to see real results in those issues.]  \n",
