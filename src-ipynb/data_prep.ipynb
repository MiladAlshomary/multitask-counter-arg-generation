', the problem is that no one can fully comprehend marriage and still believe that they and their partner can succeed at it., it's an impossible promise to fulfill., it is impossible to know someone so well that you know for a fact that they will never betray you, ever., the marriages that end due to natural death of old age and have never been violated by either party are few and far between., if we could extend the human life expectancy another 50 years i don't doubt they would have ended in divorce., i understand that marriage isn't supposed to be perfect or easy., it's supposed to be difficult., you're supposed to work together through the rough times., however if a person or their so consciously violate the marriage, or even if you just eventually get tired of being married, then what is the point in being married at all?, and i think given enough time, every marriage will have at least one party who after all is said and done would move on if they could., i think it would be much better to say, 'i care about you and trust you so much that i am literally willing to do anything i can fathom you asking of me and anything within reason to protect you and our relationship, as long as i still feel like it. ', people get bored of each other., they learn things about each other they don't like., they meet someone new and exciting and better than their partner that they'd like to explore a relationship with., they should be free to move on when they're not into it anymore without the stigma of divorce., i am 100 for monogamy., relationships should remain exclusive unless both parties explicitly agree otherwise., cheating is never okay., change my view., i hope i didn't offend anyone; i don't mean to insult anyone by insinuating that they're foolish for getting married., i just think that society has unrealistic expectations of the human attention span when it comes to relationships., also, it's early in the morning and i haven't slept., i've proofread twice, but i'm on a new phone and i'm still getting used to the keyboard., thanks ahead of time for your responses., thanks to u electrostaticrain and everyone else who made the argument that many of the things i thought were a requirement of marriage, are not actually required by law .]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[i say americans because i know the release window for some media products is ridiculous in other countries., if the corporation hasn't even made it available in your country, then i think you may as well pirate it., it's not legal but i wouldn't call you immoral for doing so., americans however have no excuse., i think we generally have access to all the media we could ever want, and most of it is set at a reasonable price., no matter what device we use or where we are in the country or whether we prefer physical or digital media, we have options., therefore, americans who pirate are just out to get something for free that they ought to have paid for., here's a few examples of the options we have: television: you can get a cable subscription for lt; 50 a month which gets you access to nearly every network, and for a few extra bucks you get hbo and other premium content., if you don't need all the channels, many networks now will put up free episodes on their websites or on hulu a week after their original air date, asking only that you watch a few ads., if you hate ads or you want content that isn't free online, you can purchase episodes for 1. 99 2. 99 on itunes and similar services, you can watch on netflix either on instant watch 8 month or by renting discs same price ., finally, you can buy full seasons on dvd, and once some time passes you can order used versions of these for cheap from amazon or you can see if your library has them, for free., in the rare event that a show isn't available through any of these channels, then other people must be having trouble watching it, too., just don't watch it and either the show will fail, or the corporation will be incentivized to make it easier to watch., i don't see a reason to pirate a tv show, ever., music: getting cheap music is incredibly easy these days., most bands artists will have a website or a youtube channel or a bandcamp. com page nowadays and will let you browse their catalogs for free., pandora is another free method of music discovery that many people find effective., if you're like me, you won't like all that much music, and you'll be able to afford to buy the few albums singles that you enjoy in a given year., albums are about 10 a pop and singles . 75 1. 29., if you love a lot of music, then it's worth your money to get a 10 month spotify or rhapsody subscription, which allow you to download as much music as you want, and from what i've seen their catalogs are decently extensive., failing all that, you can buy a used cd from amazon; i've gotten many an album for lt;5 shipped this way., record stores, although they're dwindling in number, are another good way to get cheap discs., once again, i'm not seeing any legitimate reason of any american to pirate music when they have all these options., i'll skip doing a paragraph on movies since the arguments are so similar to those for tv, and i'll do ebooks instead: amazon lets you read the first chapter of any book, similar to how most people would try out a book in a bookstore before deciding to purchase., even without this, i think that moreso than other media, people are okay with choosing books based on what kind of press and reviews they're getting., failing this, you can get a prim subscription and get access to their kindle library, the details on which i'm fuzzy but my impression is you can rent books for free as long as you want to keep them., finally, there have been a few startups for book subscription services this year that give you unlimited downloads for about 9 a month, however i've heard their selection is still limited., if none of thee options work for you, you could still just go to a real library and get whatever book you want free from there, or by a used book online or in a bookstore for a low price., despite all the options people have for consuming media, for some reason there's still a culture on reddit of people complaining that they have no fair way to get their content, which i find ridiculous., i've pirated media a few times, and each time it had nothing to do with unfair prices or unavailability and everything to do with me wanting something for free that i know, in a fair world, i should pay something to experience, whether it be money or my attention to advertisements., and i think that's the only reason the vast majority of americans pirate, too., cmv]</td>\n",

', the problem is that no one can fully comprehend marriage and still believe that they and their partner can succeed at it., it's an impossible promise to fulfill., it is impossible to know someone so well that you know for a fact that they will never betray you, ever., the marriages that end due to natural death of old age and have never been violated by either party are few and far between., if we could extend the human life expectancy another 50 years i don't doubt they would have ended in divorce., i understand that marriage isn't supposed to be perfect or easy., it's supposed to be difficult., you're supposed to work together through the rough times., however if a person or their so consciously violate the marriage, or even if you just eventually get tired of being married, then what is the point in being married at all?, and i think given enough time, every marriage will have at least one party who after all is said and done would move on if they could., i think it would be much better to say, 'i care about you and trust you so much that i am literally willing to do anything i can fathom you asking of me and anything within reason to protect you and our relationship, as long as i still feel like it. ', people get bored of each other., they learn things about each other they don't like., they meet someone new and exciting and better than their partner that they'd like to explore a relationship with., they should be free to move on when they're not into it anymore without the stigma of divorce., i am 100 for monogamy., relationships should remain exclusive unless both parties explicitly agree otherwise., cheating is never okay., change my view., i hope i didn't offend anyone; i don't mean to insult anyone by insinuating that they're foolish for getting married., i just think that society has unrealistic expectations of the human attention span when it comes to relationships., also, it's early in the morning and i haven't slept., i've proofread twice, but i'm on a new phone and i'm still getting used to the keyboard., thanks ahead of time for your responses., thanks to u electrostaticrain and everyone else who made the argument that many of the things i thought were a requirement of marriage, are not actually required by law .]  \n",
       "136  [i say americans because i know the release window for some media products is ridiculous in other countries., if the corporation hasn't even made it available in your country, then i think you may as well pirate it., it's not legal but i wouldn't call you immoral for doing so., americans however have no excuse., i think we generally have access to all the media we could ever want, and most of it is set at a reasonable price., no matter what device we use or where we are in the country or whether we prefer physical or digital media, we have options., therefore, americans who pirate are just out to get something for free that they ought to have paid for., here's a few examples of the options we have: television: you can get a cable subscription for lt; 50 a month which gets you access to nearly every network, and for a few extra bucks you get hbo and other premium content., if you don't need all the channels, many networks now will put up free episodes on their websites or on hulu a week after their original air date, asking only that you watch a few ads., if you hate ads or you want content that isn't free online, you can purchase episodes for 1. 99 2. 99 on itunes and similar services, you can watch on netflix either on instant watch 8 month or by renting discs same price ., finally, you can buy full seasons on dvd, and once some time passes you can order used versions of these for cheap from amazon or you can see if your library has them, for free., in the rare event that a show isn't available through any of these channels, then other people must be having trouble watching it, too., just don't watch it and either the show will fail, or the corporation will be incentivized to make it easier to watch., i don't see a reason to pirate a tv show, ever., music: getting cheap music is incredibly easy these days., most bands artists will have a website or a youtube channel or a bandcamp. com page nowadays and will let you browse their catalogs for free., pandora is another free method of music discovery that many people find effective., if you're like me, you won't like all that much music, and you'll be able to afford to buy the few albums singles that you enjoy in a given year., albums are about 10 a pop and singles . 75 1. 29., if you love a lot of music, then it's worth your money to get a 10 month spotify or rhapsody subscription, which allow you to download as much music as you want, and from what i've seen their catalogs are decently extensive., failing all that, you can buy a used cd from amazon; i've gotten many an album for lt;5 shipped this way., record stores, although they're dwindling in number, are another good way to get cheap discs., once again, i'm not seeing any legitimate reason of any american to pirate music when they have all these options., i'll skip doing a paragraph on movies since the arguments are so similar to those for tv, and i'll do ebooks instead: amazon lets you read the first chapter of any book, similar to how most people would try out a book in a bookstore before deciding to purchase., even without this, i think that moreso than other media, people are okay with choosing books based on what kind of press and reviews they're getting., failing this, you can get a prim subscription and get access to their kindle library, the details on which i'm fuzzy but my impression is you can rent books for free as long as you want to keep them., finally, there have been a few startups for book subscription services this year that give you unlimited downloads for about 9 a month, however i've heard their selection is still limited., if none of thee options work for you, you could still just go to a real library and get whatever book you want free from there, or by a used book online or in a bookstore for a low price., despite all the options people have for consuming media, for some reason there's still a culture on reddit of people complaining that they have no fair way to get their content, which i find ridiculous., i've pirated media a few times, and each time it had nothing to do with unfair prices or unavailability and everything to do with me wanting something for free that i know, in a fair world, i should pay something to experience, whether it be money or my attention to advertisements., and i think that's the only reason the vast majority of americans pirate, too., cmv]  \n",

       "50  [i say 'almost always' because you never know when a lebron type athletic qb will come along., my only caveat is a bona fide freak of nature., i've yet to see such a player., my reasons: 1., the nfl is a pass first league., without an elite passer, teams cannot compete for super bowls., aside from a few anomalies, this is a hard and fast rule., the role of the qb is to get the ball to the open man downfield., a completed pass, on average, nets more yardage than a run, therefore a completed pass is more valuable than a run., teams that put a high value on a qb's ability to run the ball are over valuing this skill., 2., qb's that have the ability to run learn from a young age to bail on pass plays too early whenever they feel the rush closing in., they have likely been the best and fastest athletes on the field during their entire amateur careers, so running has likely led to big plays., in the nfl, the defenses are bigger and faster and can close on a qb much more quickly than high school or college defenders., 3., qb's with elite running ability take more risks during a game., by holding the ball or leaving the pocket, they are opening themselves up to big hits resulting in fumbles and devastating injuries., injured qb's have no value to their team., chronically injured qb's drafted as a franchise qb not only have no value, but they can leave a team wallowing in mediocrity for years decades., injuries must be avoided at all costs., 4., most running qb's have to be 'broken' of their penchant for scrambling in lieu of keeping their eyes downfield., this causes their development to be stunted in comparison to qb's whose sole focus has been honing their elite passing skills only., in a league where the continued employment of coaches and gm's is contingent upon winning right now, a delay in the development of a qb can cost seasons and jobs and thus continuity ., franchises with frequent management turnover are not competitive., 5., tom brady, peyton manning, drew brees all have basically zero running skills whatsoever yet all three are the best of their generation and super bowl champs., the following is an aside and not meant to be part of my view that needs changing., in conclusion and just to add a little more controversy to my ramblings , it is my position that cam newton, rg 3, and colin kaepernick will never win a super bowl., if we look ahead to the 2014 nfl draft, my belief is that the biggest gamble and potential franchise killer amongst the available qb's is johnny manziel., if my analysis holds true, any team that uses a high first round pick on manziel to be their franchise qb is likely betting their future on a player that has an extremely small probability to lead them to a super bowl win., change my view.]   \n",

       "38  the system you are describing is not capitalism. under capitalism, do you get directly rewarded for your hard work? no, most of the hardest workers get paid piecemeal wages, and live in terrible conditions. it's never going to be profitable to meet everyones needs. welfare states are built off the exploitation of foreign workers, you can't have a global system that would adquetely satisfy need. there are viable alternatives. socialism, where industry is worker owned, is viable, and has existed. you can still have market socialism where there is still a profit motive, but it's not capitalism, so it is a 'viable alternative' while fitting your idea of what you think is viable. many other forms of socialism, while being non market, reward people for their contribution, directly for their hard work. so, your ideal system is actually socialism, which is an alternative to capitalism.   \n",
