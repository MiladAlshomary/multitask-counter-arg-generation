The simplest answer is that they aren't taxed because not-for-profit organizations get tax exemptions. A church could randomly decide one day that it was no longer interested in religion and only wants to be a not-for-profit charity and their tax situation would be the same.\\n\\nOf course, with the benefits of tax exempt status comes regulation -- for example, they are not supposed to be involved in political campaigning.   \n",
