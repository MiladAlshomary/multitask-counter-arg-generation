Regardless of words, a proud, towering statue implies this was something to be respected., A tall plinth that makes the subject tower over the observer inherently places the subject in a position of moral superiority., A statue is not merely a reminder that history happened; it is a depiction of how we choose to remember it. Replacing the statues with new art that reflects current values shows that our values as a country have changed., It is impossible to honor a person or event without the invocation of ideology; to \"honor\" something requires that you ascribe normative value to it, and normative values only exist in the context of ideology. That is, you cannot say \"this thing is good, and deserves to be honored\" without presupposing some definition of 'good.' That supposition of what is 'good' is a normative belief, and therefore definitionally an element of ideology., For example the dedication of Hood's Texas brigade monument included statements about the inferiority of black people. books.google.co.uk]   \n",
