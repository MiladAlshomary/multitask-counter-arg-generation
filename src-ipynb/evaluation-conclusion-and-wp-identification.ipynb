       "      <td>i'm tired of ordering food from somewhere and being told a food item 'isn't available. ' this is false advertising. if something is on the menu, it better be available to order, whether it's noon or a minute before closing time. furthermore, i don't believe restaurants should really ever be closed at all. many places have zoning laws for who can build a restaurant and operate it. why should restaurants be given preference for this when they're going to be closed half the time? we should require restaurants to always be open for maximum public benefit. i therefore propose the following law: section a: false advertising in the restaurant industry reform 1. anybody who operates a restaurant or similar food serving establishment is required to comply with the following regulations and penalties 2. if, during posted business hours, a customer requests that an item listed on the menu, website, advertising brochure, or other advertisement by the company be prepared for him, and the company is unable to comply with this order within a reasonable amount of time, the customer must immediately be informed of his right to file a complaint against the company in court for false advertisement, and handed the paperwork to do so. penalties assessed at such a hearing may be as high as 1000 for a first violation and 10000 for subsequent violations in a single year, in addition to all court costs. 3. in lieu of the procedure described above, the company may choose to immediately compensate such a customer without requiring for a complaint to be levied through the courts. the customer shall be given the following as compensation: a any item of comparable value to the originally ordered item, for free b the greater of 10 off of his order or 33 off his order c an additional 10 to reimburse any travel expenses occurred by the customer in his transportation to the eating establishment d the company shall also document this event and ackowledge that false advertising has been committed, and submit a 100 fine to the local government at the earliest opportunity. if this fine has been paid and these compensations have been properly documented, it shall be a defense in court against a suit regarding false advertisement by the customer for this particular date. 4 this section does not apply to certain items only offered during a particular time of day ordinarily eg, a 'breakfast menu,' provided that the time restrictions for this section of the menu are clearly posted and clearly advertised. 5 any company who is not operational during their advertised business hours, without a 48 hour notice posted prominently on their door, website, and any active social media accounts, shall be liable for a 2000 fine to the government and up to 5000 in total punitive damages to be distributed amongst all parties who have notified the appropriate authority that they attempted to eat there that day and were unable to. section b: '24 hour mandate' 1. all companies who have grossed over 100,000 in sales revenue from food in any of the past 3 years 'large companies' are subject to the 24 hour mandate, and will have 2 years from the date this law is passed to comply. all other companies 'small companies' may choose to participate for additional tax benefits. a 'small company' becomes subject to the mandate immediately effective the following year, if they gross over 100,000 from sales of food in any given year. a new company is assumed to be a 'small company' upon creation until they gross 100,000 in a year. 2. companies subject to the mandate have up to 48 hours in a given year in which they may be closed. these hours must be clearly posted on the company's door, and also on any operational websites and social media accounts, at least 3 months in advance of these dates. 3. for every additional 100 hours a company is closed, outside of these 48 hours, the company shall be charged a tax penalty of . 5 of their gross revenue from food sales. for illustration, this has most restaurants that would choose to follow a 'typical schedule' of being open 73 hours a week, paying an additional 25 tax on gross revenue. pretty untenable since that's probably their whole profit margin . 3. any company that is closed for 0 hours in a given year is permitted to take an additional tax deduction of 2000. any 'small company' that chooses to subject themselves to this mandate, and be closed no more than 48 hours in a given year, shall be permitted to take an additional tax deduction of 2000. any 'small company' that is closed 0 hours in a given year shall be permitted to deduct an additional 1000 as well as the aforementioned 2000 so what would this have? no one could ever 'run out' of something, first of all, it'd be a logistical nightmare under these requirements. companies would likely prepare more food than was needed to comply. additional regulations could give these companies tax crs for choosing to donate this food to food banks. people always know the whole menu is available, more food for food banks, sounds good to me. secondly, places aren't taking up space being closed anymore. it becomes a whole lot harder to rob places when 'everything else is closed,' because there will be no time when 'everything else is closed. ' companies hire more people to comply with more shift times, and unemployment drops drastically. very small companies who can't afford this would be unaffected because of the 'small company' exception. people who work night shift would no longer have limited eating options during and after work. sounds good to me.</td>\n",

' a few pieces of information to start with i've put about 8 hours into the game, have managed to eek out one victory, and usually place in the top 25. to start, the controls are wonky at best. aiming a weapon is a chore and the camera controls, which would be effective in a slower paced game, often leave a lot to be desired. building anything is difficult and unrewarding, especially because more complex structures seem to require perfect placement of the objects you're laying down. the actual concept of the game is really amusing, i like the idea of the everyone for themselves shooter on a massive scale, but in practice this concept falls apart. the two most effective strategies for success in the game seem to be 1 get really, really good to get past the skills gap or 2 find some weapons and a hiding place where you won't be noticed too quickly, then run to the next when the coast is clear. there's little incentive to engage in combat early in the game, and if you find a location that puts you well inside the eye of the storm early you might not have to move at all until the endgame. it's hide and seek, without the satisfaction of real human interaction. on top of this, the in game chat is incredibly toxic. granted, this is a problem in many games, but i've never been screamed at by teenagers with this consistency before. it's embarrassing. there are better shooters, better multiplayer experiences, better steath sneaking games, and better online experiences available on every platform. this is a game i want to like. it's got some cool pieces to it. but when those pieces come together, the execution just doesn't work. i am willing to concede that there is a chance this might be a 'me' problem due to my logtime disconnection from gaming as a hobby. but i'll need to be convinced. please, cmv.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i was just reading this thread 28 f so 29 m throws away food that exceeds the in r relationships. you can read the whole thing if you want, but the tl;dr is: 'so throws away raw food because there's not enough room in the pan to cook it'. my initial reaction to the post was, essentially 'so what? if they choose to do so, who cares? ' , but then i read the replies, and it seems like 99 of reddit disagree with me some quite vehemently and think that throwing away good food is a moral failling. several people are saying they couldn't date someone who would do this, which blew my mind. i don't think i've ever been so off from the consensus opinion, which makes me wonder if there's something about my point of view that is wrong or not well thought out. as for my view, it basically boils down to: who cares? you can do whatever you want with your possessions as long as you aren't harming someone else. is it a waste of money? sure! but people waste their money all the time, in much more offensive ways than occasionally throwing out some food scraps. since the thread gives lots of examples of reasons people disagree with op's so's behavior, i'll try to address the most common ones here so you have a sense of what some of my rebuttals would be. other people are starving poor, so it's fucked up to do this. this strikes me as a poor argument that quickly devolves to absurdity. you could say this about so much of what we do in western society. i have no doubt that if i had a day to observe the life of every person making this argument, i could find at least one thing they did to which the above argument applied. an animal gave their life so you could eat. i am eating most of the animal. i'm not sure how eating 90 of an animal is perfectly fine but eating only 70 of the same animal has people wondering if you're on the spectrum 28 f so 29 m throws away food that exceeds the du62ylx . it's easy to pack the food back up, so you are being lazy by not doing so. i don't think it has much to do with laziness, or at least i don't think it's valid to assume that this is happening because of laziness. this situation has happened in my life several times: we cook something together, there are some ingredients left over, i say i'm going to throw them out, they say 'oh no you simply can't! food waste noooo! let me take them i will use them', and then i see that same food molding in their fridge three months later. i know myself well enough that i won't use them, so i err on the side of throwing things out. throwing away perfectly good food is like throwing away money, and is therefore stupid. if i could put that chicken breast in my wallet and go buy a coffee with it i might agree. different people have different utility functions. i'm not wealthy, but i have enough money that throwing out a dollar or two of chicken every now and then is not going to materially affect my life. what will materially affect my life is: saving time by not having to store the food; and reducing the clutter amount of stuff in my life. i feel much happier throwing things out and buying back the lt;5 of things i end up needing again than having a bunch of shit in my fridge house that i in theory might need again at some point but in practice rarely use.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          i am a 1st time poster here, so sorry if i broke any rules. and sorry for my english. i have had pets all my life, and i believe most of these pets lived above averagely good. there are multiple advantages pets have over animals living in wild, or as strays: full access to food and water, shelter, medication etc. a lot of animals that end up as pets probably avoided a miserable life on the street, or dying from some terrible illness, or being killed by some other animal etc. i am aware of all these advantages. i still see some fundamental problems in the position of an animal as a pet: pets are often taken away from their parents or their pack. they often don't grow up, learn and socialise with their species and families. they don't get the chance of going through their natural, evolutionary model of maturation and learning. as pets, they are deprived of freedom. pets are bound by the space of their house apartment, or the owner's yard. if pets are to go somewhere beyond that, they are to be taken by leash 'in chains' , or in transporter boxes. dogs are often tied by chains, or in small yard boxes, and cats often never leave the house. birds, guinea piggs and other such animals are locked in very small cages. their freedom is also taken in the form of decision making, as they can't do anything which is in any way contrary to the idea of their owner. they are trained and punished, forced to obey and comply with the lifestyle and wishes of their owners. whenever they express some natural, evolutionary trait which conflicts the 'policy' of their owner or society, they are punished in one way or the other. pets are often used as toys to people, or human children. pets are trained to comply and put up with this, or they are percieved as 'dangerous'. animals with character, or who don't accept certain human behaviour towards them and react upon it may suffer severe consequences, from abandonment of their owner, to being put down in some specific cases. humans also don't respect body integrity of animals, and often they change their appearances through medical operations, cutting of ears, tails, wings etc. of animals, or sterilise them, cuting of their reproductive organs. we also, in order to create some specific physical trait in pets, historically went through racial selection and created for example dog races that look specifically, or are specialised for certain activity, but often these races have some biological disadvantages or problems in their life which wouldn't exist in natural species evolution. i also want to add that i am not some animal rights activist, and these ideas developed from my observation of the relationship of humans and animals as pets in general. i believe that, even in the best case possible, pets are in structurally subordinate position in their relation with humans which resembles some kind of slavery or prison, and i came to believe that having pets is an immoral thing to do.

       "844  i'm tired of ordering food from somewhere and being told a food item 'isn't available. ' this is false advertising. if something is on the menu, it better be available to order, whether it's noon or a minute before closing time. furthermore, i don't believe restaurants should really ever be closed at all. many places have zoning laws for who can build a restaurant and operate it. why should restaurants be given preference for this when they're going to be closed half the time? we should require restaurants to always be open for maximum public benefit. i therefore propose the following law: section a: false advertising in the restaurant industry reform 1. anybody who operates a restaurant or similar food serving establishment is required to comply with the following regulations and penalties 2. if, during posted business hours, a customer requests that an item listed on the menu, website, advertising brochure, or other advertisement by the company be prepared for him, and the company is unable to comply with this order within a reasonable amount of time, the customer must immediately be informed of his right to file a complaint against the company in court for false advertisement, and handed the paperwork to do so. penalties assessed at such a hearing may be as high as 1000 for a first violation and 10000 for subsequent violations in a single year, in addition to all court costs. 3. in lieu of the procedure described above, the company may choose to immediately compensate such a customer without requiring for a complaint to be levied through the courts. the customer shall be given the following as compensation: a any item of comparable value to the originally ordered item, for free b the greater of 10 off of his order or 33 off his order c an additional 10 to reimburse any travel expenses occurred by the customer in his transportation to the eating establishment d the company shall also document this event and ackowledge that false advertising has been committed, and submit a 100 fine to the local government at the earliest opportunity. if this fine has been paid and these compensations have been properly documented, it shall be a defense in court against a suit regarding false advertisement by the customer for this particular date. 4 this section does not apply to certain items only offered during a particular time of day ordinarily eg, a 'breakfast menu,' provided that the time restrictions for this section of the menu are clearly posted and clearly advertised. 5 any company who is not operational during their advertised business hours, without a 48 hour notice posted prominently on their door, website, and any active social media accounts, shall be liable for a 2000 fine to the government and up to 5000 in total punitive damages to be distributed amongst all parties who have notified the appropriate authority that they attempted to eat there that day and were unable to. section b: '24 hour mandate' 1. all companies who have grossed over 100,000 in sales revenue from food in any of the past 3 years 'large companies' are subject to the 24 hour mandate, and will have 2 years from the date this law is passed to comply. all other companies 'small companies' may choose to participate for additional tax benefits. a 'small company' becomes subject to the mandate immediately effective the following year, if they gross over 100,000 from sales of food in any given year. a new company is assumed to be a 'small company' upon creation until they gross 100,000 in a year. 2. companies subject to the mandate have up to 48 hours in a given year in which they may be closed. these hours must be clearly posted on the company's door, and also on any operational websites and social media accounts, at least 3 months in advance of these dates. 3. for every additional 100 hours a company is closed, outside of these 48 hours, the company shall be charged a tax penalty of . 5 of their gross revenue from food sales. for illustration, this has most restaurants that would choose to follow a 'typical schedule' of being open 73 hours a week, paying an additional 25 tax on gross revenue. pretty untenable since that's probably their whole profit margin . 3. any company that is closed for 0 hours in a given year is permitted to take an additional tax deduction of 2000. any 'small company' that chooses to subject themselves to this mandate, and be closed no more than 48 hours in a given year, shall be permitted to take an additional tax deduction of 2000. any 'small company' that is closed 0 hours in a given year shall be permitted to deduct an additional 1000 as well as the aforementioned 2000 so what would this have? no one could ever 'run out' of something, first of all, it'd be a logistical nightmare under these requirements. companies would likely prepare more food than was needed to comply. additional regulations could give these companies tax crs for choosing to donate this food to food banks. people always know the whole menu is available, more food for food banks, sounds good to me. secondly, places aren't taking up space being closed anymore. it becomes a whole lot harder to rob places when 'everything else is closed,' because there will be no time when 'everything else is closed. ' companies hire more people to comply with more shift times, and unemployment drops drastically. very small companies who can't afford this would be unaffected because of the 'small company' exception. people who work night shift would no longer have limited eating options during and after work. sounds good to me.   \n",

' my problem is that fortnite is a bad game, even taking into account that it's still in 'beta. ' a few pieces of information to start with i've put about 8 hours into the game, have managed to eek out one victory, and usually place in the top 25. to start, the controls are wonky at best. aiming a weapon is a chore and the camera controls, which would be effective in a slower paced game, often leave a lot to be desired. building anything is difficult and unrewarding, especially because more complex structures seem to require perfect placement of the objects you're laying down. the actual concept of the game is really amusing, i like the idea of the everyone for themselves shooter on a massive scale, but in practice this concept falls apart. the two most effective strategies for success in the game seem to be 1 get really, really good to get past the skills gap or 2 find some weapons and a hiding place where you won't be noticed too quickly, then run to the next when the coast is clear. there's little incentive to engage in combat early in the game, and if you find a location that puts you well inside the eye of the storm early you might not have to move at all until the endgame. it's hide and seek, without the satisfaction of real human interaction. on top of this, the in game chat is incredibly toxic. granted, this is a problem in many games, but i've never been screamed at by teenagers with this consistency before. it's embarrassing. there are better shooters, better multiplayer experiences, better steath sneaking games, and better online experiences available on every platform. this is a game i want to like. it's got some cool pieces to it. but when those pieces come together, the execution just doesn't work. i am willing to concede that there is a chance this might be a 'me' problem due to my logtime disconnection from gaming as a hobby. but i'll need to be convinced. please, cmv.   \n",

                                                                                                                             first of all, i understand the pros of cryptocurrency and i think the blockchain is a cool technology. however, i would argue that having a currency that isn't controlled by anyone is bad idea: 1. currency needs to be stable, bitcoin clearly isn't and it will never be because no one can control it. 2. bitcoin transactions are both slower and more expensive than fiat despite there being much less of them. 3. there's endless amounts of other cryptos piggybacking the success of bitcoin. some of these have much more flaws than bitcoin. some of them are ponzi schemes. 4. there's 'banks' for cryptocurrency that are getting hacked or scamming people out of their bitcoin. bitcoin may be safe itself but all hackers and information security experts know that the biggest weakness is always the user. most people don't understand how cryptocurrencies work, heck many people don't understand how computers work, so they're extremely easy targets for scammers. 5. most market places do not or no longer accept bitcoin as payment. even most of the owners of bitcoin are not using at as a currency, they're holding it as an investment. 6. bitcoin is a bad investment. bitcoin, after failing to be a currency will be just digital numbers on some computers with no inherent value to them. sure some people managed to make a lot of money with the bubble, but people have made a lot of money with other bubbles too. smart investors have already taken their money out of bitcoin. some people claim investing in bitcoin is no different from investing in gold but gold is a real material that is used in jewelry, luxury items, electronics, satellites, medicine etc. 7. bitcoin is terrible for the environment. mining bitcoin or other cryptos uses crazy amounts of energy that could be used on something actually useful. we are already struggling to move to clean energy, crypto mines are the last thing we needed. 8. the bitcoin bubble is increasing the prices of gpus. good if you sell gpus, bad if you're everyone else. but i don't have a degree in economics, so feel free to tell me why i'm wrong. and sorry about any typos or bad grammar there might be. english is not my native language and this is not the easiest topic to have a conversation about.

                                                        hello r changemyview i've been a metalhead for as long as i can remember. i enjoy good ol' and new rock n' roll. i enjoy many kinds of music from blues to punk to electronic. freaking love tchaikovsky, bach and chopin and everything in between including some weird repetitive european crap that can barely pass as music and yet i can't bring myself to enjoy led zeppelin. it's a sin i know, and i'm doomed to burn in hell forever. i've tried to listen to them, i type 'led zeppelin' on youtube and i'm presented with many results none of which sound interesting nor entertaining. i've really tried. i spent a solid hour at work trying to listen to them before realizing 'where's the goddamn' music? where's the guitar and the drums? where's the fun? ' nowhere to be found. please change my view, show me their worth. i don't think i get them. i need help. i guess i like led zeppelin now. thanks everyone!   \n",

spending considerable time, the benefits are outweighed by the negatives. i mean sure you can compare yourself against others in your area of job but as far as i can tell thats the primary benefit of actually making an account. aditionally, the actual useful stuff like seeing everyone whos checked your account and seeing the top skills employees have are hidden behind their premium account which is absurdly expensive. so, change my view and show me how linkedin is actually useful and beneficial for people looking to find jobs, especially soon to be graduates.   \n",

' , but then i read the replies, and it seems like 99 of reddit disagree with me some quite vehemently and think that throwing away good food is a moral failling. several people are saying they couldn't date someone who would do this, which blew my mind. i don't think i've ever been so off from the consensus opinion, which makes me wonder if there's something about my point of view that is wrong or not well thought out. as for my view, it basically boils down to: who cares? you can do whatever you want with your possessions as long as you aren't harming someone else. is it a waste of money? sure! but people waste their money all the time, in much more offensive ways than occasionally throwing out some food scraps. since the thread gives lots of examples of reasons people disagree with op's so's behavior, i'll try to address the most common ones here so you have a sense of what some of my rebuttals would be. other people are starving poor, so it's fucked up to do this. this strikes me as a poor argument that quickly devolves to absurdity. you could say this about so much of what we do in western society. i have no doubt that if i had a day to observe the life of every person making this argument, i could find at least one thing they did to which the above argument applied. an animal gave their life so you could eat. i am eating most of the animal. i'm not sure how eating 90 of an animal is perfectly fine but eating only 70 of the same animal has people wondering if you're on the spectrum 28 f so 29 m throws away food that exceeds the du62ylx . it's easy to pack the food back up, so you are being lazy by not doing so. i don't think it has much to do with laziness, or at least i don't think it's valid to assume that this is happening because of laziness. this situation has happened in my life several times: we cook something together, there are some ingredients left over, i say i'm going to throw them out, they say 'oh no you simply can't! food waste noooo! let me take them i will use them', and then i see that same food molding in their fridge three months later. i know myself well enough that i won't use them, so i err on the side of throwing things out. throwing away perfectly good food is like throwing away money, and is therefore stupid. if i could put that chicken breast in my wallet and go buy a coffee with it i might agree. different people have different utility functions. i'm not wealthy, but i have enough money that throwing out a dollar or two of chicken every now and then is not going to materially affect my life. what will materially affect my life is: saving time by not having to store the food; and reducing the clutter amount of stuff in my life. i feel much happier throwing things out and buying back the lt;5 of things i end up needing again than having a bunch of shit in my fridge house that i in theory might need again at some point but in practice rarely use.   \n",

unless they break the rules which are already in place, which a lot of the time they do. morning it's a workday, expext me to take anywhere between 3 to 8 hours to respond here's the thing. it's no secret reddit has plenty of racists, sexists, extreme nationalists, you name it. that's whether they call themselves any of that or not. it's also clear that a lot of people here don't think reddit should be a platform for such views. many people here want to ban nationalist subreddits, ban the alt right, ban t d, nazis, what have you. to be clear, i don't want them here either, and i don't want them anywhere else. i believe that many of them incite violence and bullying, which is against reddit policy, and is grounds for removal. however, the banning should not be otherwise specific to any political or societal views. there are many reasons i believe this: blocking people because of their views, no matter how ridiculous, leads to a lack of understanding, we forget why they have those views, we forget what we should be avoiding. we start further ignoring those we are trying to fight against. know the enemy. people can't sharpen their debate skills if they don't know who they're debating. echo chambers. even though we don't want to hear about them constantly, we also don't want to further the divide. they'll just go somewhere else. they'll start a lot of shit about how they think it's censorship, how it's 'proof people are ignoring the truth' or some shit. they'll call it blatant dismissal, which frankly, it is. there have been extremist subreddits shut down in the past, but they haven't been shut down directly for their views. often they were shut down for doxxing or violence. they did take it the wrong way, but once again, i believe this reason for banning them is fine. ing to add more points: people have been mentioning reddit's business reputation, and i believe it might be more harmed by partial decisions than controversial content. it's easy for reddit to say that they don't share the views of their users, and it's hard for them to have a chance at the reputation of a more free open impartial platform, if they start digging more into what can and can't be said. reddit already consisting of echo chambers shouldn't be a reason to make it worse. if we ban users, they'll probably create new accounts. if we ban subs, besides moving to another site, they might also flock to other subs, or just create new ones. a lot of what i'm seeing comes from the assumption that a subreddit ban would get rid of them in the first place. how would we define political extremism so that it doesn't start covering everyday political discourse? where do we draw the line to prevent that slippery slope? serious question, i'm not being rhetorical about it.   \n",

                                         i just saw on the news that elon musk have sold over 20 thousand flamethrowers. they appear to be oversized blowtorches designed to be just below the limits that would require licenses in most states. in a promotional video, he jokes around with it, pretending to use it on the cameraman. on twitter, he jokes about it been useful during a zombie apocalypse. but, as far as i know, no real use for it is seriously discussed. i find this behaviour borderline negligent. if these things become even more popular, it is just a matter of time until someone gets seriously hurt. either on purpose, or by accident. a lot of comments point out that cars are also dangerous. while this is true, cars and other tools also serve a purpose. musk seems to be simply advertising this product as a toy. lots of comments mention the fact that this is just a blow torch. while this might be true, the fact is that the product was not designed to be efficiently used as a blow torch. also, people buying the flamethrowers are not the same public that buys blow torches. musk is using an impending zombie epidemic as a a funny sales pitch.   \n",

for lethal injection. one person can be given a blank for guilt reasons and the shooters be volunteers. this would be cheaper and more efficient as well as easier to carry out for poor or developing countries. the organs of the dead person could also be used to help others, lethal injections often ruin the organs of the body. a lot of you seem to have confused logic, you don't want to execute people because its cruel but also you want them to suffer in jail for 20 years and don't want to kill them because it would be letting them off lightly or something   \n",
